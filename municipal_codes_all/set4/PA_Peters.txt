In order to properly implement this article, a set of personnel rules and

§ 44-21 CHARTER § 44-24
C:95
the customary and most reasonable methods whereby the purposes of
the personnel program as outlined in this article can be effectuated. It is
contemplated that as the personnel merit system is implemented pursuant
to the Home Rule Charter and this article, the rules and regulations may
be from time to time amended and revised. The personnel rules and
regulations as outlined above, and as the same may be from time to time
amended and revised, are therefore hereby incorporated herein by
reference thereto with the same force and effect as though each and every
one of the personnel rules and regulations were set forth at length in
this ordinance and these rules and regulations are marked Exhibit "A" and
expressly made a part hereof.30

The annual budget submitted by the Township Manager shall include a

the terms of the contract, agreement or arbitration award shall apply and
take preference over the provisions of this article, but only to the extent that
a conflict exists. All other provisions of this article which are not subject to
a conflict shall be, nevertheless, fully applicable in the premises.

This chapter shall be known as the "Peters Township, Alarm System
Ordinance."
§ 105-2. Definitions. [Amended 6-26-2017 by Ord. No. 817]
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALARM SYSTEM  Any device designed or used for detection of a physical
force or condition inherently characteristic of a fire, intrusion into a
building, structure or facility or for alerting persons in the attempt or
commission of a crime or an emergency situation involving potential death
or serious injury and which is directly connected to an audible alarm or
the transmission of a related signal or message which is used to evoke an
emergency response to any address or separate component of any system.
FALSE ALARM  The activation of an alarm system or the report of such
an activation by a property owner, lessee or any other person occupying or
otherwise on any premises within Peters Township to which a public safety
agency responds when a crime, fire or other emergency has not occurred.
This shall also be taken to mean false alarms as defined by the National Fire
Incident Reporting System.
PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY  Any municipal agency including the Police
Department, Fire Department and any other duly constituted municipal
authority, including but not limited to, the Washington County

A. Many of the emergency alarms to which the Peters Township Police and
emergency personnel respond are false. False alarms are herewith
deemed to be nuisances resulting in a waste of municipal manpower
and creating the potential for serious injury to police officers, Fire
Department personnel, and other emergency personnel responding to a
false alarm. Further, when said personnel are responding to false
alarms, they are not available for the protection of residents and the
general public of the Peters Township Police territory.
B. The danger created by emergency responses from false alarms is
unnecessary and hazardous.

be made, a false fire or security alarm, directly or indirectly, to any police,
fire department or agency responding to alarms within the Township. A
person and/or entity that causes or permits to be caused a false alarm
violates this chapter.

817]
§ 105-7. Violations and penalties; fines. [Amended 6-26-2017 by
Ord. No. 817]
C. The unnecessary waste of public revenue through responses to false
alarms should be eliminated.
D. False alarms have created conditions causing danger and annoyance to
the general public.
A. All fire alarms shall be built and maintained to the standards defined in
NFPA 72 and Chapter 165, Construction Codes, Uniform, of the Code of
Peters Township.
B. All components of a burglar or criminal alarm system must be
maintained by the property owner or lessee in good repair to assure
maximum reliability of operation.
C. The Township shall retain the authority, at reasonable times and upon
written or oral notice, to enter upon any premises within the Township
and to inspect the installation and operation of an alarm system to
ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
A. Any person or other entity who, after receiving notice, written or oral,
from the Peters Township Police, that police, emergency personnel or
other municipal officials have responded to two false alarms as defined
in this chapter during one calendar year shall thereafter pay a service
fine of $50 for a third false alarm in the same calendar year, $75 for a
fourth alarm in the same calendar year, and $100 for the fifth alarm,
and the sixth and subsequent alarms will be fined at $300 per false
alarm thereafter, in the same calendar year, plus the costs of
prosecution.

than as allowed by Pennsylvania law, and all records shall be so maintained
that the contents thereof shall not be divulged to anyone except to the
persons charged with the administration of this chapter.

SECTION 921.0 SMOKE CONTROL SYSTEMS
921.1 General: Smoke control systems required by this code shall
conform to the provisions of this section.
921.2 Design Criteria: The smoke control system shall be designed
to keep the smoke layer interface above the highest of either: the
highest unprotected opening to adjoining spaces, or six feet (1,829
mm) above the highest floor level of exit access open to the atrium
for a period of 20 minutes. This limiting height of the smoke interface
above the atrium floor is "z." Provisions shall also be made to provide
for smoke removal from the atrium at a rate of not less than two air
changes per hour by means of natural or mechanical ventilation.
921.2.1 Passive System: Active smoke control is not required where
it is shown that the smoke interface level requirement will be met
without operating smoke exhaust.
921.2.1.1 Regular Spaces: For spaces with flat ceilings, a constant
horizontal cross-section area above the smoke layer interface, and an
A/H2 ratio between 0.9 and 21, the following equation shall be used to
estimate the height of the interface at 20 minutes:
Z = 0.67 H - 0.28H In
Where:
z = Height from floor to the smoke interface (feet)
t = Time for interface to descent to z; use 1,200 seconds
§ 165-2 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 165-2
C:148
H = Atrium height; floor to flat ceiling (feet)
Q = Steady heat release rate; use 4,400 Btu/sec. where the
primary use groups is M, S-1, or F-1. Otherwise use 2,000
Btu/sec.
A = Horizontal cross-sectional are of the above ceiling space
being filled (square feet). Maximum A to be used shall be:
A = 21 H2
921.2.1.2 Irregular Spaces: For spaces with sloped or irregular
ceilings, A/H2 ratios outside the specified range, or varying cross
sections, the filling time shall be determined using numerical
integration from the ceiling to the critical smoke interface. The
following equations shall be used to determine the rate of smoke
production:
Where the interface level is above the limiting elevation (z) use:
V = 20.8Q 1/3 z 5/3 + 3.98 Q
Where the interface level is below the limiting elevation (Z) use:
V = 19.7 Q 3/8 z
Where:
V = the volumetric rate of smoke production (cubic feet per
minute)
z1 = limiting elevation (feet) = 0.533 Q 2/3
921.2.2 Mechanical Systems: Where the smoke filling predicted in
Section 921.2.1 does not meet the design criteria of Section 921.2,
mechanical exhaust shall be provided to maintain these conditions.
Sufficient mechanical exhaust shall be provided to maintain the smoke
layer interface at or above the critical elevation for the twenty-minute
period. The volumetric rate of smoke production (v) as determined
by the equations in Section 921.2.1.2 shall be used to determine
the exhaust rate to maintain the interface at the critical level (z).
The minimum exhaust rate to be supplied for smoke control shall be
adjusted in accordance with Table 921.2.2.1.

§ 229-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Peters Township
Grading Ordinance."
§ 229-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter (§§ 229-1 through 229-17) shall not be to
preclude development but to ensure that grading enhances rather than
detracts from or ignores the natural topography, resources, and amenities
of the land; to provide minimum standards to safeguard persons and
property; to protect and to promote the public welfare by preventing excess
erosion, hazardous rock and soil slippage, sediment production, and other
soil and water management problems; to conserve the natural contours
of the land in the Township by regulating and controlling the design,
construction, quality of materials, use, location and maintenance of grading,
excavation and fill; and to conserve existing trees and vegetation and
preserve excessive slopes. To this end, development shall be planned to fit
the topography, soils, geology, hydrology, and other conditions existing on
the proposed site and oriented to the site so that grading and other site
preparation is kept to an absolute minimum.

down onto the lower properties as a result of the grading work on
the higher property.
(3) Fencing. At the top of all cut or fill slopes which are to be steeper
than two horizontal to one vertical, and eight or more feet in total
height, a fence not less than four feet in height, and of a design
meeting the approval of the Township Engineer shall be erected
prior to the commencement of grading operations.
(4) Hazardous conditions. Whenever the Township Engineer
determines that any existing excavation, embankment, or fill has
become a hazard as defined in § 229-4 of this chapter, the owner of
the property upon which the excavation, embankment, or fill is
located, or other person or agent in control of said property, upon
receipt of notice from the Township Engineer shall, within 24 hours
or other reasonable period specified therein, repair, reconstruct, or
remove such excavation, embankment, or fill so as to eliminate the
hazard. If, after such notification, the property owner, or his agent,
has not made the necessary repairs, within the time specified, then
the Council may direct Township employees or hired personnel to
make the required repairs and the cost thereof shall be borne by
the property owner, said costs to be collected in the manner
provided by law, including the imposition of a lien against the
property.99
(5) Workdays. None of the work or activity covered by a grading permit
shall be conducted on a Sunday or legal holiday without the
approval of the Council or the Council's designated
representative.100

C:208
conducted in accordance with Chapter 402, Article I, Logging and
Timber Harvesting, of the Code of Peters Township.
(3) Excessive slopes. Excessive slopes of 25% or more may not be
graded in order to minimize erosion and storm runoff to protect
watersheds, to discourage erosion of soils by maintaining adequate
foliage cover on excessive slopes; and to promote the perpetuation
of open space on hillsides. An excessive slope is determined as
defined in § 229-4 of this chapter.
(4) Erosion and sedimentation controls.
(a) All grading shall be done in conformity with the requirements
of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
(25 Pa. Code Chapter 102). Reports and plans required to be
submitted to this agency shall also be submitted to the
Township even when the area involved is less than 25 acres.
(b) Guidelines for minimizing erosion and sediment contained in
the "Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook" for Washington
County, Pennsylvania, and the Department of Environmental
Protection, Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Manual,
shall be followed. One or a combination of guidelines shall be
used to minimize hazard, depending on site conditions and
proposed grading. However, the Township Engineer may
approve grading plans not meeting guidelines of these
handbooks if proposed grading will not constitute a hazard.
(c) All slopes exceeding 3:1 shall be sown with crown vetch or
other approved anti-erosion vegetation.
(d) Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water
from damaging the cut face of excavations and/or the sloping
surface of fills. Interception and diversion facilities for
stormwater and surface water runoff, both above and below
the cut area during and after construction, shall be included in
the design.
(e) Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion.
(f) Care shall be taken to prevent sedimentation from entering
natural watercourses for existing channels, and suitable
protection shall be provided for periods of possible flooding.
Approved anti-erosion devices shall be installed where
directed to achieve this requirement.
(5) Stream encroachment. Refer to Section 903 of the Peters Township
Zoning Ordinance.101
101. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 440, Zoning.
§ 229-5 CHARTER § 229-5
C:209
(6) Floodplain protection. Refer to Section 902 of the Peters Township
Zoning Ordinance.102
(7) Stormwater management. Adequate provisions shall be made to
manage stormwater runoff safely on the grading site. Stormwater
management controls shall be designed so that the peak rate of
runoff (discharge) from all stormwater outfalls on the site conforms
to the applicable stormwater management performance standards
for the Stormwater Management District in which the site is
located. (Refer to Chapter 371, Stormwater Management, of the
Code of Peters Township.)
(8) Vegetation and revegetation. In addition to the erosion and
sedimentation controls required for the protection of the land
during construction, the following standards shall be complied
with:
(a) Vegetation shall be removed only when absolutely necessary,
e.g., for buildings, filled areas, roads.
(b) Every effort shall be made to conserve topsoil which is
removed during construction for later use on areas requiring
vegetation or landscaping, e.g., cut and fill slopes.
(c) Vegetation sufficient to stabilize the soil shall be established on
all disturbed areas as each stage of grading is completed.
(d) Either the grading plan or a separate landscaping plan shall
specify the revegetation and slope stabilization of all disturbed
ground. Slopes exceeding 3:1 in residential subdivision
development or on commercial or industrial sites shall be
landscaped as required in Chapter 385, Subdivision and Land
Development, § 385-33E, or § 311 of the Zoning Ordinance.103
(e) All disturbed soil surfaces shall be stabilized or covered prior
to the first day of November. If the planned impervious
surfaces (e.g., roads, driveways, parking lots, etc.) cannot be
established prior to November 1, a temporary treatment
adequate to prevent erosion shall be installed on those
surfaces.
(f) The developer shall be fully responsible for any destruction of
native vegetation proposed for retention. He shall carry the
responsibility both of his own employees and for all
subcontractors from the first day of grading until release by
the Township. The developer shall be responsible for replacing
such destroyed vegetation. The use of qualified personnel
experienced and knowledgeable in the practice of revegetation
shall be required.

Ord. No. 451; 3-22-1993 by Ord. No. 453]
C. Maintenance.
(1) The owner of any property upon which an excavation or fill has
been made shall maintain in good condition and repair the
excavation or fill constructed and also all retaining walls, cribbing,
drainage structures, fences, ground cover, and any other protective
devices as may be a part of the permit requirements.
(2) If, at any time subsequent to the completion of the grading work,
the cut face or fill slope shall evidence signs of deterioration,
erosion, or other evidence which might be detrimental to the
properties above and below the graded site, the Township Engineer
may direct the property owner to take necessary remedial steps in
accordance with sound engineering practice to restore the grading
to a safe condition, and to do so in a reasonable period of time.
A. Recommended maximum slope steepness of a cut shall be three
horizontal to one vertical for minimizing erosion and landslide hazard.
This maximum limitation is most desirable as it can be maintained as
lawn area. However, a government review agency, professional
engineer, or engineering geologist may recognize the types of soil on
the site to be graded from the soil survey or a more detailed
professional field analysis. Maximum slopes can then be determined as
follows:
(1) Slopes of less than 25% which have landslide-prone or unstable
soils shall have cut slopes not steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical unless a soils engineer's report recommends up to a
maximum of a two horizontal to one vertical slope.
(2) Slopes of less than 25% which are not landslide prone or unstable,
or have a low probability of being landslide prone shall have a slope
not steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, unless a
satisfactory soils engineer's report (including core borings) is
submitted to the Township Engineer with the grading plan,
indicating that up to a 1:1 slope is structurally sound and erosion
resistant. In such case, a maximum of a 1:1 slope 20 feet in height
may be permitted only in the commercial or industrial zoning
districts, providing it is deemed aesthetically acceptable to the
Planning Commission.
(3) Cut slopes which are steeper than 2:1 may also be allowed under a
grading permit through the utilization of retaining walls, with the
approval of the Township Engineer and the Planning Commission.
The developer must show that the slope-wall combination is
absolutely necessary to develop the property. Requirements for
retaining walls are in § 229-8 of this chapter.

C:211
§ 229-7. Specific standards for fill. [Amended 7-8-1991 by Ord. No.
451]
B. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall generally be set back three feet
from adjacent property lines in order to permit the normal rounding of
the edge without encroaching on the abutting property. The top edge of
a slope shall be set back eight feet from adjacent lines in a buffer area
and the maximum grade permitted in the remainder of the buffer area
shall not exceed three horizontal to one vertical. In commercial and
industrial districts, the top or bottom of slope shall be set back 10 feet
from the curb. On a state road, a release must be obtained for cut or fill
within the right-of-way. See Chapter 385, Subdivision and Land
Development, § 385-33D, of the Code of Peters Township for grading
requirements next to new streets.
C. Excavations shall not extend below the angle of repose or natural slope
of the soil under the nearest point of any footing or foundation of any
building or structure unless such footing or foundation is first properly
underpinned or protected against settlement or movement.
D. Adjoining properties and structures shall be protected as provided in
the Township's Building Code as is then on file in the office of the
Building Inspector and/or as required by the Township Engineer.
E. All blasting which is conducted in the Township shall be in conformity
with state requirements and shall be in compliance with the Act of
1957, July 10, P.L. 685, 73 P.S. §§ 164 to 168, as amended, and the
Department of Environmental Protection and regulations promulgated
pursuant to the aforesaid statute.
F. General standards set forth in § 229-5 of this chapter must also be met.
A. Gradients.
(1) Fill not steeper than three horizontal to one vertical is desirable
and is to be utilized whenever possible.
(2) No fill shall be made which creates a slope steeper than two
horizontal to one vertical. The Township Engineer may impose
conditions requiring that a fill be constructed with an exposed
surface flatter than two horizontal to one vertical, if, under the
particular circumstances involved, such flatter surface is necessary
to stability and for the safety of persons and property.
(3) If deemed necessary by the Township Engineer, a written report
can be required from a soils engineer, certifying that he has
inspected the site and that the proposed fill will not endanger any
property or result in personal hazard or property damage.
(4) Filled slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be
allowed under a grading permit through the utilization of retaining
walls, with the approval of the Township Engineer and the Planning
§ 229-6 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 229-7
C:212
§ 229-8. Specific standards for retaining walls on all properties
other than single-family lots. [Amended 3-22-1993 by Ord. No. 482]
Commission. The developer must show that the slope-wall
combination is absolutely necessary to develop the property.
Requirements for retaining walls are in this chapter.
B. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or earth,
the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements:
(1) No man-made material may be used as fill except as approved by
the Township Engineer.
(2) The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time as
determined by the Township Engineer and so specified on the
grading permit.
(3) Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill to a depth of two feet minimum to effectively
conceal all materials used in the fill other than clean soil or earth. If
the filling operation is intermittent, the Township Engineer may
require that the top and exposed surfaces of the fill be so covered
at the completion of each such interruption.
(4) No grading permit shall be issued for the filling of materials other
than clean soil or earth until a faithful performance bond is
provided as required in § 229-12D of this chapter.
C. No fill of any kind shall be placed over trees, stumps, vegetation,
topsoil, or other materials to prevent slippage and/or the attracting of
rodents.
D. All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of fill material and to
prevent undesirable settlement or slippage. Fills shall be compacted
using modern methods and equipment. Fills shall be constructed under
the supervision of a qualified soils engineer who shall certify, in writing,
as to the adequacy of the compaction and he shall submit results of the
compaction tests to the Township Engineer.
E. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall, generally, be set back three feet
from adjacent property lines in order to permit the normal rounding of
the edge without encroaching on the abutting property.
F. General standards set forth in § 229-5 of this chapter must also be met.
A. When the topography and natural condition of the property is such that
a ground slope of two horizontal to one vertical is not feasible, the
Township Engineer and the Planning Commission may consider the
submission of a grading plan showing a retaining wall and ground slope
combination that would be aesthetically acceptable.
§ 229-7 CHARTER § 229-8
C:213
§ 229-9. Grading plans. [Amended 4-14-1986 by Ord. No. 352]
Every applicant for a grading permit shall file a written application thereof
with the Township. Such applicant shall:
B. Criteria for the acceptance of such a combination shall as a minimum
provide:
(1) That the retaining wall(s) not exceed a height of six feet.
(2) That if the plan incorporates terracing, that the gradient of the
slope between retaining walls not exceed two horizontal to one
vertical and that the diagonal distance between walls be at least
equal to the height of the retaining wall.
(3) Where a stable natural rock ledge is existing as established by a
written statement from a soils engineer, a similar design of rock
ledge and ground slope combination may be considered by the
Township Engineer and the Planning Commission.
C. When a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy a requirement of this
chapter, a wall detail must be submitted reflecting sound engineering
practices bearing the seal of a professional engineer, architect or
surveyor. A permit is required unless the wall detail is shown on a site
plan or similar construction plan which has been reviewed by the
Township Engineer.
D. The backfilling of retaining walls and the insertion of subterranean
drainage facilities shall be done strictly in accordance with the
provisions of §§ 229-5 through 229-9 of this chapter and the appropriate
Township specifications, if any.
E. In general, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the vertical face
of the wall shall be set back a minimum of three feet from the adjoining
property.
(1) An exception to this requirement may be applied for and granted by
the Township Engineer if it can be satisfactorily demonstrated that
such an exception is necessary to permit normal use of the
property, i.e., for a sideline driveway, or other reasonable
considerations.
(2) The requirement of this subsection may also be set aside when the
proposed retaining wall is a joint venture between adjacent
property owners, and appropriate documents so stating are filed
with the application for the permit.
A. Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by lot,
block, tract or street address, or similar description which will readily
identify and definitely locate the proposed work.
B. Be accompanied by plans and specifications prepared, signed, and
sealed by a professional engineer or surveyor, and include the items

enumerated below. The stormwater management plan for the grading
site shall be prepared according to the provisions of Chapter 371,
Stormwater Management. Applicants for site plan review may
incorporate their grading plan in the site plan with the permission
of the Township Engineer. Applicants for subdivisions or land
developments shall incorporate the requirements for a grading plan in
the preliminary plat. Such plans shall be at the scale of one inch equals
20 feet, except with the permission of the Township Engineer, and shall
include:
(1) A description of the site proposed for grading;
(2) Accurate location by lot, block, tract, street address, a location map
or other similar information;
(3) A contour map showing the present contours of the land and the
proposed contours of the land after completion of the proposed
grading at intervals of not less than two feet, or as permitted by the
Township Engineer;
(4) A plan showing cross sections of the proposed cut or fill which show
the method of benching both cut and/or fill;
(5) In addition, a plot plan shall show the location of the grading
boundaries, lot lines, neighboring streets or ways, buildings,
surface and subsurface utilities, and waterways;

single-family lot), one of which shall be reproducible in nature.
§ 229-9 CHARTER § 229-9
C:215
§ 229-10. Plan review. [Amended 7-8-1991 by Ord. No. 451]
E. The Planning Commission, upon the recommendation of the Township
Engineer may waive the preparation of plans by a professional engineer
or surveyor if they determine that it is not necessary, that it creates no
potential nuisance or hazard, and it does not include the construction of
a fill upon which a structure is to be erected.
F. State the estimated dates for the commencement and completion of
grading work.
G. State the purpose for which the grading application is filed.
H. State whether excavated material is to be used as on-site fill or if it is to
be removed from the site. If material is to be removed from the site, the
location and quantity of such disposal must be stated in the application.
A separate grading permit may be required for each such off-site fill, as
herein required in § 229-11 of this chapter.
I. The Township Engineer may require from the applicant, or the
applicant's engineer, information and reports from governmental
agencies, and scientific and/or engineering journals, if available, and
professional engineers and/or engineering geologists, if necessary. This
information and these reports must be of sufficient detail to insure that
proposed grading will not create a hazard and that there will be a
minimum of soil erosion on the site to be graded.
J. To be adequate, a geological report shall include a detailed description
of the geological conditions of the site; include conclusions and
recommendations that will demonstrate the relationship of the
geological conditions to the proposed development, including
hazardous conditions, water resources, mineral resources, and
environmental impact. A soil conservation report shall include existing
site description as to topography, drainage, cover, and soils, major
resource problems as to soil limitations, erosion and sediment potential
and surface runoff changes; and recommendations to minimize soil
limitation, erosion and sediment, and surface water disposal problems.
A. All grading plans, with the exception of those for grading on a singlefamily
lot in the residential district, shall be submitted to the Peters
Township Planning Commission for its review, within the same time
limits prescribed for the review of site plans. The Township Engineer
shall make a written report. The stormwater management plan for the
grading site shall be reviewed and approved according to the provisions
of Chapter 371, Stormwater Management, of the Code of Peters
Township.
B. All grading in connection with single-family residential lots shall be
subject to the review of the Building Inspector with the advice of the
Township Engineer, if necessary.

C:216
§ 229-11. Permits. [Amended 4-14-1986 by Ord. No. 352]
A grading permit must be obtained from the Township for new grading,
excavations, fills, changes, additions, or alterations made to existing
excavations or fills, all of which shall conform to the provisions of § 229-9
of this chapter. A separate grading permit shall be required for each site.
One permit may cover the grading, excavation and fill made on the same
site. If excavated material is to be removed from a grading site, it shall be
noted on the application. Such off-site disposal may require the securing of
a separate permit as noted below.
C. If proposed grading is not associated with approved development plans
(site plan or subdivision plan), the owner must be prepared to
demonstrate at the time of application that the proposed grading is in
the best interest of Peters Township and consistent with the likely
development of the parcel which is the subject of the application and
will not detract from the use of neighboring property and the character
of the neighborhood.
D. If a departure is granted on the grade of slope, special consideration
shall be given in review of the plan as to how the slope can be concealed
by landscaping.
A. Exceptions. A grading permit, performance and completion bond and
cash escrow will not be required for the following:
(1) Foundation excavation incidental to an issued building permit.
(2) Excavation and/or fill on a site not exceeding 500 cubic yards [in
addition to Subsection A(1), above], or four feet in depth, providing
a 3:1 slope is maintained.
(3) Off-site fill disposal not exceeding 500 cubic yards, or four feet in
depth, providing a 3:1 slope is maintained.
(4) Grading for the public improvements in a subdivision or land
development as approved by the Township Engineer and subject to
the performance and completion bond required by Chapter 385,
Subdivision and Land Development, §§ 385-41 through 385-45.
(5) Applications, permits, and bonds notwithstanding, the
requirements of §§ 229-5 through 229-8 of this chapter shall apply
to any grading, excavation and/or fill and shall be enforced by the
Township regardless of amount (cubic yardage or depth).
B. Expiration of permit. Every grading permit shall expire by limitation
and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not
been commenced within six months or is not completed within one year
from the date of issue, provided that the Council, acting upon the
recommendation of the Township Engineer, may, if the permit holder
presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented
work being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant
§ 229-10 CHARTER § 229-11
C:217
§ 229-12. Fees and completion and performance guarantees.
a reasonable extension of time, and provided, further, that the
application for the extension of time is made before the date of
expiration of the permit.
C. Denial of permit; appeal.
(1) A grading permit can be denied for the following reasons:
(a) When, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, work proposed
by the applicant does not comply with the provisions of § 229-9
of this chapter or other Township ordinances or is likely to
endanger any property, or person, or any street or alley, or
create hazardous conditions. In determining whether the
proposed work is likely to endanger any property or any street
or alley, or create hazardous conditions, the Township
Engineer shall give due consideration to possible saturation by
rains, earth movements, runoff surface waters, and subsurface
conditions such as the stratification and faulting of rock,
aquifers, springs and the nature and type of the soil or rock;
(b) When, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the
proposed grading is excessive and not necessary for the
utilization of the site;
(c) When the grading plan proposes the grading of excessive
slopes as defined in § 229-4 of this chapter.104
(2) The Council shall, within 45 days, consider appeals from the
decision of the Township Engineer or from the Planning
Commission and shall consider alternate methods, standards or
materials proposed by the developer when, in its opinion, strict
compliance with the provisions of this chapter is unwarranted or
creates a hardship. Any modifications of the applicable stormwater
management standards, particularly the standards governing
allowable peak rate of runoff, shall be determined to be consistent
with the overall stormwater performance standard stated in
Chapter 371, Stormwater Management. Any applicant or permit
holder shall have the right to appeal to any court of competent
jurisdiction from any decisions of the Council within 30 days of its
decision. The Township Engineer and/or the Planning Commission
may or may not submit recommendations in favor of the appeal.
A. The administrator shall receive the applications and shall collect all
fees, escrows and required bonds.
B. Grading fees will be based on the volume of material to be graded in
accordance with the Schedule of Fees, Chapter 195, Fees.

§ 229-13. Grading inspection and supervision.
C. Before issuance of a grading permit, the Administrator may require the
applicant to post $200 in cash plus a performance bond, corporate
surety, or other approved security in the amount of 20% of the
estimated cost of grading work and other control facilities proposed, to
guarantee that said work and facilities will be completed in a
satisfactory manner and meet the requirements of §§ 229-5 through
229-8 of this chapter. No bond shall be required if another bond or
other approved security is posted for construction and/or site
improvements which covers the cost of the grading and other control
facilities. When all requirements of this permit have been met and the
work has been completed in a satisfactory manner, the security shall be
replaced with a maintenance bond guaranteeing the work for a period
of two years after completion thereof.
D. No grading permit shall be issued for the filling of materials other than
clean soil earth until a faithful performance bond in the amount of at
least 20% more than the Township Engineer's estimated cost of
adequately covering such fill with clean soil or earth has been furnished
to the Township. Such bond shall be executed by a corporate surety, as
well as by the principal, and shall be subject to the approval of the
Township Solicitor as to form. The bond shall inure to the benefit of the
Township and be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the work
required under the terms and conditions of the grading permit to the
satisfaction of the Township Engineer. In lieu of such bond, a cash
deposit or a certified check in the same amount may be made with the
Township Treasurer.
A. Plans for grading work and other control facilities, bearing the stamp of
approval of the Township Engineer, and a copy of the approved permit,
shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the grading work
and until the work has been completed.
B. Grading work at the various stages, or at any other time, will be subject
to spot inspections at the discretion of the Township Engineer, to
determine that work is being performed in compliance with § 229-13 of
this chapter. The permit holder shall notify the Township Engineer 48
hours prior to the following schedule of required inspections:
(1) Initial inspection. When work on the excavation or fill is to be
commenced.
(2) Rough grading. When all the rough grading has been completed.
(3) Drainage facilities. When drainage facilities are to be installed and
before such facilities are backfilled.
(4) Special structures. When excavations are complete for retaining
and crib walls and when reinforcing steel is in place and before
concrete is poured.

(5) Final inspection. When all work, including the installation of all
drainage facilities and other structures as described in the
application, has been completed.
C. Any physical changes in the site, such as surface water drainage, soil
and bedrock dislocations, alteration of groundwater discharge or any
other natural or man-made modification which would cause a doubt to
be cast upon the feasibility of the contents of the original permit
approval, must be reported to the Township Engineer within 24 hours of
discovery of such condition. Failure to do so is deemed as just reason
for revocation of the permit and forfeiture of security.
D. In special cases, when grading occurs in areas of landslide-prone soil as
recognized by the soil survey or better, the Township Engineer may
require special precautions and/or soil tests from the owner. The results
of all soil tests and core borings made relating to the site being graded
shall be submitted to the Township Engineer, cost of such tests and
reports to be borne by the permittee. Any grading of landslide-prone
soils or areas must be done under the supervision of a soils engineer, at
the expense of the permittee.
A. Neither the issuance of a permit under the provisions of § 229-11 of this
chapter, nor the compliance with the provisions hereto or with any
condition imposed by the Township official hereunder, shall relieve any
person from any responsibility for damage to persons or property
resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor impose any
liability upon the Township for damages to persons or property.
B. Compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall be incumbent
upon the person performing any grading, presence or absence of an
inspector notwithstanding.
A. No person shall construct, enlarge, alter, repair, or maintain any
grading, excavation, or fill, or cause the same to be done contrary to or
in violation of any provision of §§ 229-1 through 229-17 of this chapter.
B. When notice of any violation of, or noncompliance with, the provisions
of this chapter has been given by the Administrator or the Code
Enforcement Officer, or their representative, to any person, such
violation shall be discontinued immediately or within a reasonable time
limit specified in such notice. If such violation is not discontinued, or
extends beyond the specified time limit, the Administrator shall revoke
the grading permit and the violator shall be subject to the applicable
penalty.

§ 241-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Peters Township Impact Fee
Ordinance."
§ 241-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the Peters Township Impact
Fee Program, including a Transportation Capital Improvements Plan,106 to
ensure that the transportation system is available and adequate to support
existing volumes of traffic and traffic projected to be generated by new
growth and development. To advance this objective, the Peters Township
Impact Fee Program shall be based upon the imposition of an impact
fee payable to the Township at the time of building permit issuance.
Additionally, the program identifies existing deficiencies due to passthrough
trips and future trip generation attributable to new development.
The program will provide a continuing generation of funds necessary for
the Township to initiate and complete capital transportation improvements
as needed in support of new growth and development. Such a program
will involve participation by developers as well as local, state and federal
governments. Through the Impact Fee Program, the Township is
establishing a process whereby future traffic needs can be addressed in a
timely manner and the impact of increased traffic volumes can be minimized
to the extent possible.
§ 241-3. Findings.
The Council hereby finds and declares that:
A. The recitals set forth at the beginning of this chapter are incorporated
herein as findings of the Council as if fully set forth below.
B. The Township is committed to the provision of a transportation system
at service levels necessary to support residential and nonresidential
growth and development.
106. Editor's Note: A Revised Transportation Capital Improvements Program was approved by
the Township 9-24-2012 by Ord. No. 753. See LE-6, Plan Approval.
§ 229-17 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 241-3
C:222
C. Transportation service levels will be provided by the construction of
road improvements by the Township or by the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation ("PennDOT") utilizing funds allocated via the capital
budget, capital improvements programs, gifts, grants and donations,
formal and informal partnerships with PennDOT and impact fees.
D. The aggregation of development in the defined transportation service
area intensifies the demand for transportation improvements designed
to accommodate traffic volumes at a "D" level of service as defined by
the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Science,
which is the minimum acceptable level of service to accommodate such
development and the intensity thereof.
E. The development potential of properties in the defined transportation
service area is reflected in the RSA Report and the Township's
Comprehensive Plan and is implemented via Chapter 385, Subdivision
and Land Development, of the Peters Township Code of Ordinances,
and the Zoning Ordinance.107
F. To the extent that new development in the transportation service area
places demands upon the transportation system, those demands should
be satisfied by the establishment of an Impact Fee Program that
distributes the responsibility for financing the provision of such
transportation facilities among the Township, state and federal
governments, and developers.
G. The amount of the impact fee to be imposed has been calculated in
accordance with the provisions of the MPC108 and this chapter, applying
the engineering standards set forth in Trip Generation, 7th Edition,
2003, Vols. 1 to 3, Institute of Transportation Engineers, and any
amendments or future editions thereof.
H. The Township hereby finds and declares that an impact fee imposed
upon new development, in order to assist in the financing of specified
major transportation capital improvements in the defined
transportation service area, the demand for which has been quantified
through the application of land use assumptions provided by the Impact
Fee Advisory Committee appointed by the Council, is in the best
interest of the Township and its residents.
I. The maximum impact fee that could be levied in accordance with the
provisions of the MPC109 is $8,305 per trip in the Northern District and
$6,599 in the Southern District. A calculation of the maximum allowable
impact fee is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Attachment
D.110

will be generated by the specific construction or use authorized by the
permit. In the case of phase development, only the trips generated by
the phase being developed need to be paid at the time a building permit
or occupancy permit is issued.
C. The impact fee shall be paid at the issuance of the first permit in time in
the event that both a building permit or occupancy permit would be
issued for the same use.
D. In the event a special transportation study is performed pursuant to
§ 241-10A(5) and additional trips are being generated or would be at
full occupancy, the developer shall pay the additional impact fee with 30
days of written notice from the manager containing a copy of the
special transportation study and the calculation of the additional impact
fee based thereon.
E. In the case of land development, subdivision or planned residential
development, the methodology, basis and amount for the impact fee
shall be set forth in the developer's agreement required pursuant to
Chapter 385, Subdivision and Land Development, and the planned
residential development pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance.120 The
Council's right to conduct a special study pursuant to § 241-10A(5) shall
be set forth clearly therein. The obligation to pay additional impact fees
as a result of such a study shall run with the land and shall be the
primary responsibility of the landowner.
A. There is hereby established an impact fee as follows: [Amended
5-14-2018 by Ord. No. 828]
(1) Northern District: $1,500 per trip.
(2) Southern District: $1,500 per trip.
B. The unit cost per trip is derived from the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan and may be amended from time to time as
transportation needs dictate and as directed by the Council in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the MPC.121
C. The impact fee imposed by this chapter upon all new development shall
be determined by applying the unit improvement cost to the p.m. peak
hour trips generated by a project as identified in Trip Generation, 7th
Edition, 2003, Vols. 1 to 3, Institute of Transportation Engineers, and
any amendments or future editions thereof, or by a special
transportation study pursuant to § 241-10. To determine the fee for a
specific use, the p.m. peak hour trip generation rate for the proposed
use shall be multiplied by the unit improvement cost rate in the
appropriate transportation service area.

§ 241-8. Additional impact fee.
§ 241-9. Establishment of transportation service areas. [Amended
5-14-2018 by Ord. No. 828]
The Township has defined two transportation service areas as shown on the
Transportation Service Area Map (See Attachment E.122) in accordance with
the provisions of the MPC.123
§ 241-10. Special transportation study.
D. If the development for which a building permit is sought contains a mix
of uses, the applicant must separately calculate the impact fee due for
each type of development.
A. Applicability. An additional impact fee shall be imposed upon new
developments that generate 1,000 or more p.m. peak hour trips, net of
pass-by trips as defined by Trip Generation, 7th Edition, 2003, Vols. 1 to
3, Institute of Transportation Engineers, and any amendments or future
editions thereof. This section is in addition to the impact fee calculated
under this chapter.
B. Traffic study. An applicant for a new development that generates 1,000
or more p.m. peak hour trips shall be required to perform a traffic
analysis of development traffic impact on highways, roads or streets
outside the transportation service area in which the new development
is located, but within the boundaries of the Township. Any highways,
roads or streets or parts thereof outside the transportation service area
that will accommodate 10% or more of the new development traffic and
100 or more new p.m. peak hour trips may be required to be studied.
The traffic study is to be conducted in accordance with the Manager's
regulations.
C. Mitigation. Applicants for new development that generate 1,000 or
more new p.m. peak hour trips, less pass-by trips, shall be required to
mitigate the traffic impact of the new development on the affected
roads, highways and streets per the traffic study to maintain the
predevelopment conditions.
A. Applicability of this section. The Manager may permit or require a new
development to perform a special transportation study to document
actual trip generation from a particular use. The instances when a
special transportation study can or must be performed are limited to
instances where:
(1) The Township requests a special transportation study based upon
unique conditions of the property or the property's sensitive
location within a transportation service area;

(2) No "R" value or fitted curve equation is provided for the use in the
most recent version of Trip Generation, 7th Edition, 2003, Vols. 1 to
3, Institute of Traffic Engineers;
(3) The use is not represented in any amendments or future editions of
Trip Generation, 7th Edition, 2003, Vols. 1 to 3, Institute of Traffic
Engineers.
(4) The developer may request a special transportation study to be
completed. The request for the study must be submitted in writing
to the Township Manager no sooner than six months after the
issuance of the final occupancy permit for a use within the new
development and no later than seven months after the issuance of
the final occupancy permit for a use within the new development.
The special transportation study will be conducted by the
Township's Traffic Engineer and paid for by the developer. The
study will commence no sooner than eight months after the
issuance of the final occupancy permit for a use and no later than
20 months after the issuance of the final occupancy permit for a
use. [Amended 5-14-2018 by Ord. No. 828]
(5) At least one year after the issuance of the first occupancy permit
for a new development, the Council, at its sole discretion, on its
own motion or upon the complaint of a property owner within the
transportation service area determines that the results of the
special study used to determine the impact fee need to be
reexamined or the Council determines that the roadways nearby
the new development within the transportation service area are not
operating at the preferred levels of service.
B. Guidelines for conducting a special transportation study. Special
transportation studies must be conducted in accordance with the
Manager's regulations. The developer shall be responsible for all costs
associated with the special transportation study, except for a special
transportation study performed by the Council pursuant to Subsection
A(5) above.
C. Adjustments. Requests for adjustments of an impact fee as a result of a
special transportation study conducted under § 241-10A(4) of this
section must be in writing directed to the Manager and must be
postmarked within 18 months of the date of the check or wire transfer
paying the impact fee. No adjustments will exceed the amount of the
impact fee actually paid. The value of a single trip shall be the value
that the applicant paid, not the value at the time of adjustment.
A. Collection of impact fee. Impact fees due pursuant to this chapter shall
be collected by the Township in the manner prescribed herein prior to
issuance of a building permit.

C:229
§ 241-12. Impact Fees Advisory Committee.
B. Establishment and maintenance of accounts. The Manager shall
establish an interest-bearing trust fund account created solely for
impact fees. All interest earned on impact fees deposited in the account
shall become the funds of that account. Impact fees generated from
new development may only be expended for transportation capital
improvements identified as being funded by impact fees under the
Transportation Capital Improvements Plan in the transportation service
area, except as provided in § 241-13. There may be a single account
established for both transportation service areas; provided, however,
the Manager shall keep separate accounts of funds and interest earned
for each service area.
C. Maintenance of records. The Manager shall maintain and keep
adequate financial records for each such account that will show the
source and disbursement of all revenues, that will account for all
moneys received and that shall ensure that the disbursement of funds
from each account will be used solely and exclusively for the provision
of projects specified in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan
for the transportation service areas.
D. Annual accounting. The Township will provide that an annual
accounting is made for any account containing impact fee proceeds and
earned interest. The accounting shall include the total funds collected,
the source for the funds collected, the total amount of interest accruing
on such funds and the amount of funds expended on specific
transportation improvements. Notice of the availability of the results of
the accounting will be included and published as part of the Township's
annual audit. A copy will also be provided to the Impact Fee Advisory
Committee.
E. Assignment of impact fee revenue to specific TCIP projects. Because
the impact fee is not the maximum allowed by the MPC,124 the Manager
may charge against any individual TCIP project up to the full maximum
allowed by the MPC; provided, however, the Manager shall readjust the
impact fee portion of one or more other projects to reflect such
increased impact fee amount to keep the impact fee revenue balanced
and within the limits set forth in Attachment D.125 No adjustment by the
Manager shall increase the amount of the impact fee. All such
adjustments shall be included in the annual accounting. The maximum
impact fee amount for each TCIP project is attached hereto as
Attachment D. No adjustment shall be deemed a change in the TCIP.
F. Approval by Council. No adjustment made by the Manager pursuant to
§ 241-11E above shall take effect until approved by resolution of the
Council.

C:231
§ 241-13. Disbursement of fees for projects outside plan.
The Township may expend impact fees paid by an applicant on projects not
contained in the adopted Transportation Capital Improvements Plan if all of
the following criteria are met:

on land use assumptions in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter and the MPC.127
(6) To prepare or cause to be prepared a roadway sufficiency analysis

C. Review of transportation capital improvements or impact fee charges.
The Council may request, no more than annually but no less than once
every three years, the IFA Committee to review and make
recommendations on the transportation capital improvements or
impact fee charges based only on:
(1) Subsequent new development which has occurred in the Township;
(2) Completion of capital improvements in the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan;
(3) Unavoidable delays in construction of capital improvements
contained in the plan beyond the Township's control or
responsibility;
(4) Significant changes in the land use assumptions;
(5) Changes in the estimated costs of the transportation improvements
proposed which may be recalculated by applying the construction
cost index as published in the American City/County Magazine or
the Engineering News Record; provided, however, the Council
upon the recommendation of the Municipal Traffic Engineer may
instruct the IFA Committee to utilize another method;
(6) Significant changes in the projected revenue from sources listed.
D. Calculation of revised impact fees. In calculating a revised impact fee,
the IFA Committee shall deduct from the number of anticipated peak
hour trips generated by all new development the number of trips for
which impact fees have already been paid or which have been imposed
on approved land developments; provided, however, if a new or revised
land use assumptions report has been adopted by the Council, the
anticipated peak hour trips in such a new or revised land use
assumptions report shall be used.
A. The applicant has provided written consent to use of its collected
impact fees for specific transportation projects which are not included
in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan;
127. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 241-12 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 241-13
C:232
§ 241-14. Method of payment.
Payment of the impact fee shall be made by the applicant prior to the
issuance of a building permit, or occupancy permit if no physical
improvements are required, by the Township for the new development for
development on the applicable site.
§ 241-15. Credits.
B. The alternative transportation project, whether highway or multimodal,
has as its purpose the reduction of traffic congestion or the
removal of vehicle trips from the roadway network;
C. The Township amends its Transportation Capital Improvements Plan
components required by § 504-A(e)(1)(vi) of the Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10504-A(e)(1)(vi), to provide replacement of the
collected impact fees transferred to transportation projects outside the
approved Transportation Capital Improvements Plan from sources
other than impact fees or developer contributions within three years of
completion of the alternative projects to which the transferred fees
were applied.
A. An applicant is entitled to a credit against the impact fee in the amount
of the fair market value of any land dedicated by the applicant to the
Township for future right-of-way, realignment or widening of any
existing roadways or for the value of any construction of road
improvements contained in the Transportation Capital Improvements
Plan which is performed at the applicant's expense. The amount of such
credit for any capital improvement constructed shall be the amount
allocated in the capital improvement program and used in the
calculation of the impact fee, including contingency factors for such
work, the sum of these discounted back to the year of actual
construction if the applicant is proposing to construct a road
improvement prior to the time the same is scheduled to be constructed
in the TCIP. The fair market value of any land dedicated by the applicant
shall be determined as of the date of the submission of the land
development or subdivision application to the Township.
B. Subject to the requirements of Subsections B(1) and (2) below, any
applicant who performs, at its own expense, off-site improvements as
defined by this chapter, shall be eligible for a credit toward the impact
fee otherwise due in the amount of the lesser of the actual cost of such
off-site improvements as approved by the Municipal Engineer or the
value plus contingency shown in the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan used in calculating the impact fee discounted back
to the year of construction proposed by the applicant. Such credit shall
not exceed the amount of the impact fee required to be paid by the
applicant for the new development.
(1) In order for a new development to be eligible for this credit the
applicant must request approval to perform off-site improvements
§ 241-13 CHARTER § 241-15
C:233
during the subdivision or land development preliminary approval
process. The request must be in writing and must set forth the
off-site improvement project(s) for which the applicant is seeking
credit. The Council, at the time of its preliminary PRD, TND or
land development approval, shall approve or deny in whole or in
part the applicant's request. Where the request is approved in
whole or in part, the applicant must enter into an agreement with
the Township prior to the issuance of any building permit. The
agreement must establish the estimated cost of the improvement,
the schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement,
guarantee that the improvement be completed to Township and
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards and design
criteria, and such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary
by the Township. The Township must review the improvement plan,
verify costs and time schedules, determine if the improvement is an
eligible improvement and determine the amount of the applicable
credit for such improvement to be applied to the otherwise
applicable impact fee prior to issuance of any building permit. In
no event may the Township provide a credit that is greater than
the applicable impact fee. If, however, the amount of the credit is
calculated to be greater than the amount of the impact fee due,
the applicant may utilize such excess credit toward the impact fees
imposed on other building permits for development on the same
site and in the same ownership.
(2) The Council may deny the applicant's request in whole or in part if
any of the following conditions exist:
(a) The failure to pay the impact fee would disrupt the orderly
funding and construction of the scheduled improvements in the
Transportation Capital Improvements Plan;
(b) The impact fee is required to match state or federal funding; or
(c) The improvements proposed by the applicant do not in the
opinion of the Municipal Traffic Engineer mitigate the traffic
impact of the new development.
C. The Township may provide a credit against impact fees for the value of
any construction projects that are not contained in the adopted
Transportation Capital Improvements Plan which are performed at the
applicant's expense, if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant has provided written consent to a credit of its
collected impact fees for specific transportation projects which are
not included in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan;
(2) The alternative transportation project, whether highway or multimodal,
has as its purpose the reduction of traffic congestion or the
removal of vehicle trips from the roadway network;
§ 241-15 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 241-15
C:234
§ 241-16. Refunds.
(3) The Township amends its Transportation Capital Improvements
Plan components required by § 504-A(e)(1)(vi) of the Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10504-A(e)(1)(vi), to provide replacement
of the credited impact fees transferred to transportation projects
outside the approved Transportation Capital Improvements Plan
from sources other than impact fees or developer contributions
within three years of completion of the alternative projects to
which the transferred fees were applied.
A. The payer of the impact fee may apply for a refund of appropriate share
of any such fee and any interest earned from the date of payment if:
(1) The Township has failed to commence any transportation service
area road improvements for which impact fees are programmed to
be used and the Manager has not reallocated such funds pursuant
to § 241-11E hereof within three years of the scheduled
construction date set forth in the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan;
(2) The new development for which impact fees were paid is not
commenced prior to the expiration of a building permit issued for
the new development within the time limits established by
applicable building codes; or the project for which a building
permit has been issued has been altered resulting in a decrease in
the amount of the impact fee due;
(3) If upon completion of all road improvements project the actual
expenditures are less than 95% of the costs allocable to the
maximum impact fee allowed pursuant to Attachment D128 within
the transportation service area in which the road improvements
were programmed and constructed, the Township shall refund to
the payer the pro rata difference between the budgeted costs and
the actual expenditures, including interest from the date of
payment.
(4) In the event that the Township terminates or completes an adopted
capital improvements plan for a transportation service area and
there remains at the time of termination or completion undisbursed
funds in the accounts established for that purpose, the Township
shall provide written notice by certified mail to those persons who
previously paid the fees which remain undisbursed of the
availability of said funds for refund of the person's proportionate
share of the fund balance. The allocation of the refund shall be
determined by generally accepted accounting practices. In the
event that any of the funds remain unclaimed following one year
after the notice, which shall be provided to the last known address
provided by the payer of the fees to the Township, the Township

A. Title. These regulations shall be known as the "Property Maintenance
Code of Peters Township," hereinafter referred to as "this code."
B. Scope. The provisions of this code shall apply to all existing residential
and nonresidential structures and all existing premises and constitute
minimum requirements and standards for premises, structures,
equipment and facilities for light, ventilation, space, heating,
sanitation, protection from the elements, life safety, safety from fire and
other hazards including environmental, and for safe and sanitary
maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators and occupants;
the occupancy of existing structures and premises, and for
administration, enforcement and penalties. Provided, however, that this
chapter is not intended to supersede any other ordinance of Peters
Township currently in effect which is not in direct conflict herewith.
C. Intent. This code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent,
which is to ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are
affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and
premises. Existing structures and premises that do not comply with
these provisions shall be altered or repaired to provide a minimum level
of health and safety as required herein.
A. General. The provisions of this code shall apply to all matters affecting
or relating to structures and premises, as set forth in § 315-1. Where, in
§ 304-11 CHARTER § 315-2
C:263
a specific case, different sections of this code specify different
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
B. Maintenance. Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by
this code or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or
premises was constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in
good working order. No owner, operator or occupant shall cause any
service, facility, equipment or utility which is required under this
section to be removed from or shut off from or discontinued for any
occupied dwelling, except for such temporary interruption as necessary
while repairs or alterations are in progress. The requirements of this
code are not intended to provide the basis for removal or abrogation of
fire protection and safety systems and devices in existing structures.
Except as otherwise specified herein, the owner or the owner's
designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings,
structures and premises.
C. Application of other codes. Repairs, additions or alterations to a
structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in accordance with
the procedures and provisions of the International Building Code,
International Fuel Gas Code, International Residential Code,
International Mechanical Code and the ICC Electrical Code. Nothing in
this code shall be construed to cancel, modify or set aside any provision
of the Peters Township Zoning Ordinance or Building Fire Code.143
D. Existing remedies. The provisions in this code shall not be construed to
abolish or impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or
agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any structure which is
dangerous, unsafe and unsanitary.
E. Workmanship. Repairs, maintenance work, alterations or installations
which are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this code
shall be executed and installed in a workmanlike manner and installed
in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions.
F. Historic buildings. The provisions of this code shall not be mandatory
for existing buildings or structures designated as historic buildings
when such buildings or structures are judged by the code official to be
safe and in the public interest of health, safety and welfare.
G. Referenced codes and standards. The codes and standards referenced
in this code shall be those that are listed in § 315-24 and considered
part of the requirements of this code to the prescribed extent of each
such reference. Where differences occur between provisions of this
code and the referenced standards, the provisions of this code shall
apply.

or equipment, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not

hazard. In the case of a clear public safety hazard, the code official shall

relative codes retroactively.

and exterior property in compliance with these requirements, except as

provisions of this code.
B. Unsafe structures. An unsafe structure is one that is found to be
dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to
protect or warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such
structure contains unsafe equipment or is so damaged, decayed,
dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of such faulty construction or

disrepair or lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, lacks sanitary facilities, is
vermin or rat infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks

collapse, the code official is authorized to post a placard of
condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed up so as
not to be an attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up
the premises within the time specified in the order, the code official
shall cause the premises to be closed and secured through any available
public agency or by contract or arrangement by private persons and the
cost thereof shall be charged against the real estate upon which the

§ 315-25. Quality of life. [Added 8-26-2019 by Ord. No. 845]
A. Title. This section shall be known as the "Peters Township Quality of
Life Ordinance."
B. Purpose.
(1) The lack of maintenance of properties, littering, improper storage
of trash and rubbish, and other nuisances are costly problems that
contribute to the deterioration of property values and general
disorder of a community. Recognizing this problem, the purpose of
this section is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of
Peters Township by helping to create a clean environment for the
§ 315-24 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 315-25
C:286
citizens while eliminating safety and welfare concerns for both
residents and emergency service personnel.
(2) Implementing a mechanism for the issuance of a ticket rather than
citation permits the Township to maintain and enforce its laws and
permits a citizen so accused to resolve the dispute in a manner that
does not unduly burden the citizen by requiring the issuance of a
citation and a court hearing.
C. Violations. This section shall allow for certain actions to be taken
against property owners for violations of the following sections of the
Peters Township Code of Ordinances.
(1) § 119-22, Domestic animals.
(2) Chapter 257, Littering.
(3) Chapter 274, Nuisances.
(4) § 315-15, Exterior property areas.
(5) § 315-16, Swimming pools, spas and hot tubs.
D. Authority for issuance. Upon finding a quality of life violation, the Code
Enforcement/Zoning Officer or an entity appointed by Township Council
may issue quality of life violation tickets and/or citations to the owner
and/or occupant of the property or to the individual responsible for the
violation.
E. Service.
(1) The quality of life ticket shall be in writing and shall identify the
property address (if applicable), violation(s), specify the maximum
time frame to take corrective action, and the fine.
(2) The Peters Township Zoning/Code Enforcement Officer shall serve
the quality of life ticket to the violator:
(a) By handing the quality of life ticket to the violator;
(b) By handing the quality of life ticket to be served to an adult
member of the household or other person in charge of the
residence at the residence of the person to be served;
(c) By leaving or affixing the quality of life ticket to the property
where the violation exists (if applicable);
(d) By handing the quality of life ticket to the violator's agent or to
the person in charge thereof at any office of usual place of
business of the violator; or
(e) By mailing the quality of life ticket to the violator's address of
record.
F. Violations.
§ 315-25 CHARTER § 315-25
C:287
(1) Any person or business violating any of the referenced ordinances
shall pay a fine as set forth herein for each offense:
(a) The fine for the first quality of life ticket shall be $35.
(b) If the violation is not addressed to the satisfaction of the
designated officer and the quality of life ticket is not paid
within 10 days of issuance of the first violation ticket, the
designated officer shall issue a second quality of life ticket. The
fine for the second quality of life ticket for the same violation
shall be $50.
(c) Failure to respond. If a person fails to make payment and the
violation is not addressed to the satisfaction of the Zoning/
Code Enforcement Officer in the abatement period provided,
or the person fails to file an appeal within 10 days of a violation
ticket, they shall be subject to a citation for failure to pay.
(d) Repeated violations. Upon issuance of quality of life tickets for
the same violation, right is reserved for a Zoning/Code
Enforcement Officer to use a citation for all subsequent
violations.
(e) Continuous or egregious violations. If violations are continuous
or egregious, the Zoning/Code Enforcement Officer has the
right to issue a citation without first issuing a ticket, provided
that notice has been given. Any previously issued violation
tickets will be considered as notice given.
(f) Citation fine. Any person, firm or corporation who shall fail,
neglect, or refuse to comply with any of the terms or provisions
of this chapter, or of any regulation or requirement pursuant
hereto and authorized hereby shall, upon conviction, be
ordered to pay a fine as established in § 315-6, Violations and
penalties, Subsection C.
(2) If the Township acts to correct the violation, the cost thereof shall
be charged to the individual or property owner (if applicable) to
whom the ticket has been issued. If the costs are not paid to the
Township, the legal counsel of the jurisdiction shall institute
appropriate action against the owner of the premises where the
violation was abated by the Township.
G. Appeals.
(1) Any person who receives a quality of life ticket for any offense
under this section may, within 10 days of the service of the violation
ticket, appeal to the District Magistrate, by filing his/her appeal
request in writing, stating his/her reasons for appeal, accompanied
by the appropriate fine amount. At the appeal, the person shall
have the right to provide information at that time including the
right to question any witnesses. Only evidence relevant to the

B. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall
have the meanings hereinafter designated:
INTERFERENCE  Any inhibition or disruption of the Alcosan
facilities, its treatment processes or operations, its sludge processes,
use or disposal, or of any sewer, pipe or other conveyance located
in Peters Township, and transmitting substances into the Alcosan
facilities, which is a cause of and significantly contributes to either a
violation of any requirement of Alcosan's Natural Pollution Discharge
Elimination System Permit (hereinafter called "NPDES permit")
including an increase in the magnitude or duration of a violation or
to the prevention of sewage sludge use or disposal by Alcosan in
accordance with the following statutory provisions and rules,
regulations or permits issued thereunder: Pennsylvania Sewage
Facilities Act (35 P.S. § 750.1 et seq.), Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act
(35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.), Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act
(35 P.S. § 6018.101), Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.
§ 1251 et seq.), the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. § 6901 et
seq.), including Title II, more commonly referred to as the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, and including all Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania statutes and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Regulations prepared pursuant to Subtitle D of the Solid
Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.), and
the Toxic Substance Control Act (15 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.), County
of Allegheny Health Code and the Pollution Control Standards of the
Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission. (All such statutory
provisions, rules, regulations or permits are hereinafter collectively
called "laws.") A user significantly contributes to such a permit violation
or prevention or sludge use or disposal in accordance with the abovecited
laws whenever such user:151
§ 337-3 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 337-4
C:292
PASS-THROUGH  Any discharge of pollutant through the facilities of
Alcosan into navigable waters or any stream in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania in quantities or concentrations which are a cause of and
significantly contribute to a violation of any requirement of Alcosan's
NPDES permit (including an increase in the magnitude or duration of
a violation). A user significantly contributes to such a permit violation
where it:
Discharges daily pollutant loading in excess of that allowed by
permit or by contract with Alcosan or by federal, Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny, Alcosan or Peters Township
laws, ordinances, rules or regulations;
(1)
Discharges wastewater which substantially differs in nature or
constituents from the user's average discharge; or
(2)
Knows or has reason to know that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would result in
violation of Alcosan's NPDES permit or prevent sewage sludge use
or disposal in accordance with the above-cited laws as they apply
to Alcosan's selected method of sludge management.
(3)
Discharges a daily pollutant loading in excess of that allowed by
permit or by contract with Alcosan or by federal, Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny, Alcosan or Peters Township
laws, ordinances, rules or regulations;

Discharges wastewater which substantially differs in nature or
constituents from the user's average discharge;
(2)
Knows or has reason to know that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would result in a
permit violation; or
(3)
Knows or has reason to know that Alcosan is, for any reason,
violating its final effluent limitations in its permit and that such
user's discharge either alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, increases the magnitude or duration of
Alcosan's violations.
(4)
C. No person, firm, association or corporation shall introduce or cause to
be introduced, directly or indirectly into the facilities of Alcosan or into
any sewer, pipe or other conveyance located in Peters Township and
transmitting substances into the facilities of Alcosan, any toxic
substance, pollutant or other wastewater which will:
(1) Cause interference with the operation or performance of Alcosan's
treatment plant or other facilities; or
(2) Pass through Alcosan's treatment plant or other facilities.

contribute to a violation of any requirement of the above-cited laws
or the Alcosan NPDES permit, or adversely affect the use or
disposal of Alcosan sludge or other residues.
(2) Any substance which will endanger the life, health or safety of the
treatment plant, sewer maintenance and plant operations
personnel or which would preclude safe entry into the sewer
system or any portion of the treatment plant.

River Valley Water Sanitation Commission or Peters Township
pertaining to sewage discharge, introduction or treatment.152
A. The Township Council shall designate an agent or agents charged with
the duty of collecting all charges, of issuing all permits, sending all
notices and keeping all records necessary to carry out the provisions of
this Article I.

conviction in a summary proceeding brought before a Magisterial District
Judge under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, be guilty of a
summary offense and shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000,
plus costs of prosecution. In default of payment thereof, the defendant may
be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days. Each day

violated shall also constitute a separate offense.
A. The proper officers of the Township are hereby authorized to execute all
documents and to do all things necessary or proper to carry out the
provisions of this Article I and to comply with state and county
regulations in connection with the ownership, maintenance and

§ 342-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be referred to as the "Sexually Oriented Business
Regulation Provisions."
§ 342-2. Purpose and findings.
A. Purpose.
(1) Pursuant to its inherent authority as a home rule municipality to
prohibit nuisances, to promote the health, welfare, cleanliness,
comfort and safety of the citizens of Peters Township (hereinafter
"Township") and to regulate the time of opening and closing and
the conduct of places of public entertainment, amusement and
recreation, Peters Township enacts this chapter to minimize and
control the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of its
citizens, to protect the citizens from increased crime, to preserve
the quality of life, to preserve the property values and character of
surrounding neighborhoods and to deter the spread of blight.
(2) The Peters Township Council (hereinafter "Council") has
determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of
accountability to insure that operators of sexually oriented
businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to insure that
operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used
as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
(3) The Council does not intend by this chapter to suppress any speech
or expression activities protected by the First Amendment, but to
enact a content-neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses.
B. Legislative findings. The Council finds that:
(1) Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which
should be regulated to protect the public health, safety and
welfare. The secondary effects include, but are not limited to, the
spread of communicable diseases, performance of sexual acts in
public places, presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on
public and private property, sexual harassment, obscenity,
§ 337-45 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 342-2
C:316
prostitution and other illegal sexual activities, crime and
neighborhood deterioration.
(2) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in
a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Township. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
(3) Removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in discouraging illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult theaters.
(4) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incident of certain types of criminal
behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or
suspects and by preventing minors from working in such
establishments.
(5) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business will help limit and control the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses.
(6) It is desirable, for the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this
chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to
such activity.
(7) The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in
contravention of this chapter.
(8) The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to
and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
(9) The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the
Township will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

(6) A licensee is delinquent in payment to the Township for any

C. When the Township revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for
one year, and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually oriented
business license for one year from the date the revocation became
effective. If, subsequent to revocation, the Township finds that the basis
for the revocation has been corrected or abated, the applicant may be
granted a license if at least 90 days have elapsed since the date the
revocation became effective.
D. All license application, renewal, suspension or revocation decisions
shall be sent in writing to the applicant or licensee. All such decisions
which deny, suspend or revoke a permit shall state specifically the
chapter requirement not met and any other basis for the decision. After
denial of an application, or denial of a renewal of an application, or after

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 371-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Peters Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 371-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of Peters Township generally finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint
source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of Peters Township and all the people
of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
§ 371-1 CHARTER § 371-2
C:351
§ 371-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Peters Township, Washington County, by minimizing the harms and
maximizing the benefits described in § 371-2 of this chapter through
provisions intended to:
§ 371-4. Statutory authority.
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems
close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems to a reasonable and practical
extent.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water
resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum
of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards, and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and best management
practices (BMPs) that are constructed and implemented.

Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, through the general permit process.
J. Any stormwater management facilities or any facilities that constitute
water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream
enclosures, etc.) that are regulated by this chapter, that will be located
in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth (including wetlands),
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, the general permit process. When there
is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility
of the applicant or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PADEP.
K. Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105
concerning dam safety.
L. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
will be located on, or discharged onto state highway rights-of-way shall
be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PennDOT). These facilities may be required by
PennDOT to be owned and maintained by Peters Township. In such
case, PennDOT and Peters Township may require a written agreement
between the Township and the developer in a form acceptable to
PennDOT in accordance with their latest policies.
M. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged, where soil

C:371
§ 371-13. Exemptions/modifications.
conditions and geology permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need
for detention facilities.
N. Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the site, made as
shallow as practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site
infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements of this
chapter.
O. Roof drain discharges shall be designed to promote overland flow and
infiltration/percolation of stormwater where it is advantageous to do so
and will not create a drainage problem on adjacent property. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
Peters Township shall permit it on a case-by-case basis.
P. When appropriate and allowed by other portions of the Township Code,
applicants are encouraged to use low-impact development practices to
comply with the requirements of this chapter and the state water
quality requirements.
Q. When stormwater management facilities are proposed within 1,000 feet
of a downstream Township, the developer shall notify the downstream
Township and supply a copy of the SWM plan, if requested, for review
and comment.
A. Under no circumstance shall the applicant be exempt from
implementing such measures as necessary to:
(1) Meet state water quality standards and requirements under Title
25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams Law.
(2) Protect health, safety, and property.
(3) Meet special requirements for high quality (HQ) and exceptional
value (EV) watersheds.
B. The applicant must utilize the following BMPs to the maximum extent
practicable to receive consideration for the exemptions:
(1) Design around and limit disturbance of floodplains, wetlands,
natural slopes over 15%, existing native vegetation, and other
sensitive and special value features.
(2) Maintain riparian and forested buffers.
(3) Limit grading and maintain nonerosive flow conditions in natural
flow paths.
(4) Maintain existing tree canopies near impervious areas.
(5) Minimize soil disturbance and reclaim disturbed areas with topsoil
and vegetation.
§ 371-12 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 371-13
C:372
(6) Direct runoff to pervious areas.
C. The applicant's proposed development/additional impervious area may
not adversely impact the following:
(1) Capacities of existing drainageways and storm sewer systems.
(2) Velocities and erosion.
(3) Quality of runoff if direct discharge is proposed.
(4) Existing known problem areas.
(5) Safe conveyance of the additional runoff.
(6) Downstream property owners.
D. Single-family residential activities are exempt from these requirements,
provided the constructions:
(1) Comply with §§ 371-12G, 371-13A, B, and C; and
(2) Have buildings set back 75 feet from downstream property lines;
and
(3) Driveways.
(a) Runoff must discharge onto pervious surface with a gravel
strip or other spreading device.
(b) No more than 1,000 square feet of paved surface may
discharge to any one point.
(c) The length of flow on the pervious surface must exceed the
length of the paved surface flow.
(4) Peters Township can require more information or require
mitigation of certain impacts through installation of stormwater
management BMPs if there is a threat to property, health, or safety.
E. An applicant proposing regulated activities, after demonstrating
compliance with § 371-13A, B and C, may be exempted from various
requirements of this chapter according to the following table:

Application included in Appendix D188 may be used to document
new impervious surfaces.
F. An applicant proposing regulated activities, after demonstrating
compliance with § 371-13A, B and C, may be exempted from various
requirements of this chapter if documentation can be provided that a
downstream man-made water body (i.e., reservoir, lake, or man-made
wetlands) has been designed or modified to address the potential
stormwater flooding impacts of the proposed development.
(1) The volume control requirements specified in § 371-15 may be
exempted for a regulated activity if facilities associated with the
activity were already planned, approved and permitted as part of
another project such as a subdivision.
(2) The rate control requirements specified in § 371-16 may be
considered satisfied for a regulated activity if facilities associated

G. The purpose of this section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning between local ordinances and NPDES permitting
(when required) and to ensure that the applicant has a single and clear
set of stormwater management standards to which the applicant is
subject. Peters Township may accept alternative stormwater
management controls under this section provided that:
(1) Peters Township, in consultation with the PADEP, determines that
meeting the volume control requirements (See § 371-15.) is not
possible or places an undue hardship on the applicant.

C:374
§ 371-14. Waivers.
I. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the rate
and volume control requirement and SWM site plan preparation
requirement of this chapter, provided the activities are performed
according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102. It should be
noted that temporary roadways are not exempt.
(1) All temporary and permanent haul roads that are not to receive an
asphalt wearing course shall be designed and constructed
consistent with recommendations of the Center for Dirt and Gravel
Road Studies and the Pennsylvania State Conservation
Commission's Dirt and Gravel Road Maintenance Program.
A. The provisions of this chapter are the minimum standards for the

§ 371-12D, which states that Peters Township may, after
consultation with PADEP, approve measures for meeting the state
water quality requirements other than those in this chapter,
provided that they meet the minimum requirements of, and do not
conflict with state law, including, but not limited to, the Clean
Streams Law.
C. If an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the governing body of
Peters Township that any mandatory provision of this chapter is
unreasonable or causes unique or undue unreasonableness or hardship
as it applies to the proposed project, or that an alternate design may
result in a superior result within the context of §§ 371-2 and 371-3 of
this chapter, the governing body of Peters Township upon obtaining the
comments and recommendations of the Municipal Engineer may grant
a waiver or relief so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest is secured; provided that such waiver will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter.
D. The applicant shall submit all requests for waivers in writing and shall
include such requests as a part of the plan review and approval process.
§ 371-13 CHARTER § 371-14
C:375
The applicant shall state in full the facts of unreasonableness or
hardship on which the request is based, the provision or provisions of
the chapter that are involved, and the minimum waiver or relief that
is necessary. The applicant shall state how the requested waiver and
how the applicant's proposal shall result in an equal or better means
of complying with the intent or purpose and general principles of this
chapter.
E. Peters Township shall keep a written record of all actions on waiver
requests.
F. Peters Township may charge a fee for each waiver request, which shall
be used to offset the administrative costs of reviewing the waiver
request. The applicant shall also agree to reimburse Peters Township
for reasonable and necessary fees that may be incurred by the
Municipal Engineer in any review of a waiver request.189
G. In granting waivers, Peters Township may impose reasonable
conditions that will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements that are to be modified.

§ 371-14 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 371-14
C:376
§ 371-15. Volume controls.
(k) Infiltration of runoff throughout the proposed site has been
provided where practicable and predevelopment groundwater
recharge protected.
(l) Peak flow attenuation of runoff has been provided.
(m) Long-term operation and maintenance activities are
established.
(n) The receiving streams and/or water bodies will not be
adversely impacted in flood-carrying capacity, aquatic habitat,

A. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual
and in Appendix B190 of this chapter shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable when appropriate and
allowed by other portions of the Township Code.
B. The Small Project Stormwater Management Application included in
Appendix D191 may be used for projects under 5,000 square feet of new
impervious surface and single-family home construction. The Small
Project SWM Application allows documentation of new impervious
surface, credits through disconnection of impervious surfaces and tree
planting, and sizing of volume control BMPs that may be required.
C. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For
regulated activity, areas equal to or less than one acre that do not
require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this
chapter establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the
applicant may select either method on the basis of economic
considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical
procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the Pennsylvania BMP Manual)
is applicable to any sized regulated activity. This method requires
detailed modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
190. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
191. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 371-14 CHARTER § 371-15
C:377
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the Pennsylvania BMP Manual) is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design
Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to
regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that
require detailed design of stormwater storage facilities. For new
impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location and proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration
tests shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual.
(3) In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltrationbased
best management practices to partially fulfill the
requirements in either § 371-15C(1) or (2), the following procedure
shall be used:
(a) At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided
to justify the decision to not use infiltration BMPs:
[1] Description of and justification for field infiltration/
permeability testing with respect to the type of test and
test locations.
[2] An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and
their structure as these relate to the interaction between
soils and water occurring on the site. In addition to
providing soil and soil profile descriptions, this narrative
shall identify depth to seasonal high-water tables and
depth to bedrock, and provide a description of all
subsurface elements (fragipans and other restrictive
layers, geology, etc.) that influence the direction and rate
of subsurface water movement.
§ 371-15 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 371-15
C:378
§ 371-16. Rate controls.
[3] A qualitative assessment of the site's contribution to
annual aquifer recharge shall be made, along with
identification of any restrictions or limitations associated
with the use of engineered infiltration facilities.
[4] The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by
a professional engineer or geologist.
(b) The following water quality pollutant load reductions will be
required for all disturbed areas within the proposed
development:
Pollutant Load Units
Required Reduction
(%)
Total suspended solids
(TSS)
Pounds 85
Total phosphorous (TP) Pounds 85
Total nitrate (NO3) Pounds 50
(c) The performance criteria for water quality best management
practices shall be determined from the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, most current
version.
D. The applicable worksheets from the Pennsylvania BMP Manual must be
used in calculations to establish volume control.
A. Lands contained within Washington County that have not had release
rates established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management
Plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year storms.
B. Lands contained within Washington County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
(1) Chartiers Creek Watershed. The post-development peak discharge
rates shall be in accordance with the approved release rate map for
the individual watershed. Release rates within the Chartiers Creek
Watershed include 50%, 70% and 100% for the ten-, twenty-five-,
fifty- and one-hundred-year storms. However, within the portion of
the watershed contained in Peters Township, the release rate is
100%.

Riparian Buffer Standards
§ 371-18. Riparian buffer requirements.
Where a riparian buffer is required for a regulated activity under Title
25 Pa. Code Chapter 102, titled "Erosion and Sedimentation Control and
Stormwater Management," the riparian buffer shall be established as
follows:
A. The buffer shall be measured perpendicularly from the top of the
stream bank landward.
(1) Distance from top of bank as required by state or federal
regulations; or
(2) As determined by a stream corridor study approved by PADEP.
B. In accordance with the latest revision of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102,
riparian stream buffers are required in all high quality watersheds. The
only high quality watershed in Peters Township is the Little Chartiers
Creek watershed which extends from its headwaters to Canonsburg
Lake Dam.
C. The riparian buffer shall be located on both sides of all perennial and
intermittent streams. The perennial and intermittent streams and the
riparian buffer boundaries shall be shown on all applications for
building permits, subdivision, or land development. Existing uses within
the buffer are permitted to continue but not be expanded. Placement of
new structures or roadways (except where a roadway crossing is
designed nearly as perpendicular as is practical) within the riparian
buffer shall be prohibited.
D. The buffer shall be undisturbed forest consisting of appropriate native
species.
E. Where wetlands are located partially or entirely within a buffer, the
buffer shall be extended to encompass the wetland and shall be
widened by a distance sufficient to provide a twenty-five-foot forested
buffer measured perpendicularly from the wetland boundary.
F. The following uses shall be permitted in the required buffer:
(1) Footpaths, trails and bike paths, provided that:
(a) Width is limited to five feet;
(b) Width may be increased, provided a corresponding increase in
the buffer is provided;
(c) Construction shall have minimal impact to the buffer.
(2) Stream crossings, provided the crossing is designed and
constructed in such a manner as to minimize the impact to the
§ 371-18 CHARTER § 371-18
C:383
buffer. The riparian buffer shall be restored to its original
condition, to the maximum extent practical, upon completion of
construction.
(3) Utility lines, provided that the crossing is designed and constructed
in such a manner as to minimize the impact to the inner buffer and
provided that there is no practical alternative to locating the utility
line within the buffer. The riparian buffer shall be restored to its
original condition, to the maximum extent practical, upon
completion of construction.
(4) Maintenance and restoration of the riparian buffer.
(5) Projects conducted with the objective of improvement,
stabilization, restoration, or enhancement of the stream bank,
stream channel, floodplain, watershed hydrology, riparian buffers,
or aquatic habitat and maintenance activities associated with such
projects. These projects include, but are not limited to agricultural
and stormwater management best management practices. Such
projects must receive appropriate permits and approvals from
PADEP prior to starting the project.
(6) Minor private recreational uses for the property owner. Such uses
include benches, fire rings, and similar uses. Such uses do not
include structures such as cabins, sheds, pavilions, garages,
dwellings or similar structures.
G. Disturbance of the riparian buffer shall be limited to the area necessary
to perform an allowable use.
H. Where possible and practical, disturbances shall be phased with each
phase restored prior to beginning the next phase.
I. Allowable activities shall not cause stormwater flow to concentrate.
J. Any vegetation removed for an allowable activity shall be replaced
immediately upon completion of the activity. Where mature trees are
removed, such trees shall be replaced with the largest practical tree of
acceptable native species.
K. Erosion and sediment pollution control shall be installed and
maintained during construction. Evidence of an approved erosion and
sediment control plan and/or NPDES permit, if required, shall be
submitted prior to issuance of local permits.
L. If a permit from PADEP is required for the activity, evidence of an
approved permit shall be submitted prior to issuance of local permits.
M. Proper maintenance of riparian buffers is the responsibility of the
landowner consistent with sound forest management practices. In the
absence of a site specific management plan, the following maintenance
guidelines apply:
§ 371-18 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 371-18
C:384
§ 371-19. Riparian buffer easement.
For all required riparian buffers, an easement shall be provided to allow
Peters Township to take enforcement actions against an applicant for failure
to satisfy the requirements of the riparian buffer requirements.
(1) Buffers shall be inspected periodically by the landowner for
evidence of excessive sediment deposition, erosion or concentrated
flow channels. Prompt action shall be taken to correct these
problems and prevent future occurrence.
(2) Trees presenting an unusual hazard of creating downstream
obstructions shall be removed. Such material shall be removed
from the floodplain or the riparian buffer (whichever is widest); or
cut into sections small enough so as to prevent the possibility of
creating obstructions downstream. Wherever possible, large stable
debris should be conserved.
(3) Vegetation should be inspected periodically to ensure diverse
vegetative cover and vigorous plant growth consistent with
buffering objectives.
(4) Excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and other
chemicals shall be avoided. These products should be used only
when absolutely necessary to maintain buffer vegetation.
A. Easements shall be in accordance with Article VIII and recorded in
accordance with Article XIII of this chapter.
§ 371-18 CHARTER § 371-19
C:385

ARTICLE VI
Design Criteria
§ 371-20. Design criteria for stormwater management and drainage
facilities.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) The applicant should consider the effect on the proposed
stormwater management techniques of any special soils conditions
or geological hazards which may exist on the development site. In
the event such conditions are identified on the development site,
the Township may require in-depth studies by a competent
geotechnical engineer.
(2) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(a) The watersheds are subwatersheds of a common watershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(b) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(c) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
(3) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment-flow-type condition.
(4) Stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are encouraged (e.g.,
rooftop storage, cisterns, recreation area ponding, diversion
structures, porous pavements, holding tanks, infiltration systems,
in-line storage in storm sewers, and grading patterns). They shall
be located, designed, and constructed in accordance with the latest
technical guidance published by PADEP, provided they are
accompanied by detailed engineering plans and performance
capabilities and supporting site-specific soils, geology, runoff and
groundwater and infiltration rate data to verify proposed designs.
Additional guidance from other sources may be accepted at the
discretion of the Municipal Engineer. (A preapplication meeting is
suggested.)
(5) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(6) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. Peters
§ 371-20 CHARTER § 371-20
C:387
Township shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the continuation or exacerbation of a documented
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
(7) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses, including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Consultation with Peters Township and prior approval are
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
(a) Multiple-use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
(8) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
B. Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) Shared storage facilities, which provide detention of runoff for
more than one development site, are encouraged within a single
subarea. Such facilities shall meet the design criteria contained in
this section. In addition, runoff from the development sites involved
shall be conveyed to the facility in a manner so as to avoid adverse
impacts, such as flooding or erosion, to channels and properties
located between the development site and the shared storage
facilities.
(2) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a municipal or state roadway.
(3) The minimum horizontal distance between any structure and any
stormwater facility shall be 25 feet. The lowest floor elevation of
any structure constructed immediately adjacent to a detention
basin or other stormwater facility shall be a minimum of two feet
above the one-hundred-year water surface elevation.
(4) Stormwater management facility bottom (or surface of permanent
pool) elevations must be greater than adjacent floodplain
elevations (FEMA, HEC-RAS, or other acceptable analysis). If no
floodplain is defined, bottom elevations must be greater than

existing ground elevations 50 feet from top of stream bank in the
facilities' vicinity.
(5) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the one-hundred-year
floodplain elevation must be used for all twenty-four-hour design
storms, or the applicant may elect to determine flood elevations of
the adjacent watercourse for each twenty-four-hour design storm.
The floodplain is assumed to be 50 feet from top of stream bank in
areas where a floodplain is not designated or no other evidence is
provided.
(6) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table.

management facilities.
(11) Unless specifically designed as a volume control or water quality
facility, all stormwater management facilities must empty over a
period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours
from the end of the facility's inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests
performed at the facility locations and proposed basin bottom
depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must support time-toempty
calculations if infiltration is a factor.
(12) Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.

designed to store runoff shall provide an emergency spillway
designed to convey the one-hundred-year post-development peak
rate flow with a blocked primary outlet structure. The emergency
spillway shall be designed per the following requirements:
(a) The top of embankment elevation shall provide a minimum one
foot of freeboard above the maximum water surface elevation.
This is to be calculated when the spillway functions for the onehundred-

to require an armor other than riprap based on the visual
impact to the surrounding properties.
(d) The Municipal Engineer may require the use of additional
protection when slopes exceed 4:1 and spillway velocities
might exceed NRCS standards for the particular soils involved.
(e) Any underground stormwater management facility (pipe
storage systems) must have a method to bypass flows higher
than the required design (up to a one-hundred-year postdevelopment
inflow) without structural failure, or causing
downstream harm or safety risks.
(16) Stormwater management basins. Design of stormwater
management facilities having three feet or more of water depth
(measured vertically from the lowest elevation in the facility to the
crest of the emergency spillway) shall meet the following additional
requirements:
(a) The maximum water depth within any stormwater
management facility shall be no greater than eight feet when
functioning through the primary outlet structure.
(b) The top of embankment width shall be at least 10 feet.
(c) A ten-foot-wide access to the basin bottom must be provided
with a maximum longitudinal slope of 10%.

lifts. The lifts will each be compacted to a density of 98% of a
standard proctor analysis as per each layer of compacted fill
shall be tested to determine its density analysis per ASTM 698.
Each layer of compacted fill shall be tested to determine its
density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM 3017.
(e) A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be
provided under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
The cutoff trench shall run the entire length of the
embankment and tie into undisturbed natural ground.
(f) Anti-seep collars, or a PADEP-approved alternative, must be
provided on all outflow culverts in accordance with the
methodology contained in the latest edition of the PADEP E&S
Manual. An increase in seepage length of 15% must be used in
accordance with the requirements for permanent anti-seep
collars.
(17) Construction of stormwater management facilities.
§ 371-20 CHARTER § 371-20
C:391
(a) Basins used for rate control only shall be installed prior to or
concurrent with any earthmoving or land disturbances which
they will serve. The phasing of their construction shall be noted
in the narrative and on the plan.
(b) Basins that include water quality or recharge components shall
have those components installed in such a manner as to not
disturb or diminish their effectiveness.
(c) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site with
copies being forwarded to the Municipal Engineer.
(d) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures
shall be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins
within 15 days of construction.

Peters Township for BMPs that retain or detain water, but are of a
much smaller scale than traditional stormwater management
facilities.
C. Stormwater-carrying facilities.
(1) All storm sewer pipes, grass waterways, open channels, swales and
other stormwater-carrying facilities that service drainage areas
within the site must be able to convey post-development runoff
from the twenty-five-year twenty-four-hour design storm.

without surcharging inlets for the twenty-five-year storm
event.
(b) When connecting to an existing storm sewer system, the
applicant must demonstrate that the proposed system will not
exacerbate any existing stormwater problems and that
adequate downstream capacity exists.
(c) A minimum pipe size of 15 inches in diameter shall be used in
all roadway systems (public or private) proposed for
construction in Peters Township. Pipes shall be designed to
provide a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet per second when
§ 371-20 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 371-20
C:392
flowing full, but, in all cases, the slope shall be no less than
0.5%. Arch pipe of equivalent cross-sectional area may be
substituted in lieu of circular pipe where cover or utility
conflict conditions exist.
(d) All storm sewer pipes shall be laid to a minimum depth of one
foot from subgrade to the crown of pipe.
(e) In curbed roadway sections, the maximum encroachment of
water on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a

Gutter depth shall be verified by inlet capture/capacity
calculations that account for road slope and opening area.
[1] Inlets shall be placed at a maximum of 500 feet apart.
[2] Inlets shall be placed so drainage cannot cross
intersections or street center lines.
(f) For inlets containing a change in pipe size, the elevation for the

knocking out any of the inlet corners. All pipes entering or
exiting inlets shall be cut flush with the inside wall of the inlet.
A note to this effect shall be added to the SWM site plan or inlet
details therein.
(j) Inlets shall have weep holes covered with geotextile fabric
placed at appropriate elevations to completely drain the
subgrade prior to placing the base and surface course on
roadways.
(k) Inlets, junction boxes, or manholes greater than five feet in
depth shall be equipped with ladder rungs and shall be

(p) Stormwater roof drains and pipes shall not be connected to
storm sewers or discharge onto impervious areas without
approval by the Municipal Engineer.
(q) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel
and close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid
the possibility of failing or causing the embankment to fail.
(r) Where practical, storm sewers shall be designed to traverse
under seeded and planted areas. If constructed within 10 feet
of road paving, walks, or other surfaced areas, drains shall
have a narrow trench and maximum compaction of backfill to
prevent settlement of the superimposed surface or
development.
(s) Storm sewers shall be installed preferably after excavating and
filling in the area to be traversed is completed, unless the drain
is installed in the original ground with a minimum of three feet
cover and/or adequate protection during the fill construction.
(t) Storm sewers shall be designed:

aluminized with bonding and paved inverts where prone to
erode. All pipe within the Township road right-of-way and all
road crossing pipes or piping between inlets shall be Class III
reinforced concrete pipe, N12 ADS smooth flow pipe or
approved equal with a minimum diameter of 15 inches. When
the plastic storm sewer pipe is used, magnetic tape shall be
installed over the top of the storm sewer with a minimum of
three feet of cover over the top of the pipe.
(w) Manholes shall be designed so that the top shall be at finished
grade and sloped to conform to slope of finished grade. Top
castings of structures located in roads or parking areas shall
be machined or installed to preclude "rattling."
(5) Swale conveyance facilities.
(a) Swales must be able to convey post-development runoff from a
twenty-five-year twenty-four-hour design storm with six inches
of freeboard to top of the swale.
(b) Swales shall have side slopes no steeper than 2:1.
(c) All swales shall be designed, labeled on the SWM site plan, and
details provided to adequately construct and maintain the
design dimension of the swales.
(d) Swales shall be designed for stability using velocity or shear
criteria. Velocity criteria may be used for channels with less
than ten-percent slope. Shear criteria may be used for all
swales. Documentation must be provided to support velocity
and/or shear limitations used in calculations.
(e) Where swale bends occur, the computed velocities or shear
stresses shall be multiplied by the following factor for the
purpose of designing swale erosion protection:
[1] When swale bend is 30° to 60°: 1.75.
[2] When swale bend is 60° to 90°: 2.00.
[3] When swale bend is 90° or greater: 2.50.
(f) Manning's "n" values used for swale capacity design must
reflect the permanent condition.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual, as amended herein.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Methodology.
§ 371-20 CHARTER § 371-21
C:395
Methods shall be selected by the design professional based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site.
C. Rainfall values.
(1) Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type
II, twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in
conjunction with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or be
consistent with the following table:
Return Interval
(year)
24-Hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 1.99
2 2.38
10 3.35
25 3.96
50 4.46
100 4.99
D. Runoff volume.
(1) Rational Method. Not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development
with curve numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is NOT
acceptable.
E. Peak flow rates.
(1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should be used by the
design professional if the watershed has more than one main
drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method.
§ 371-21 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 371-21
C:396
(a) This method is recommended for design of stormwater
management facilities and where stormwater runoff volume
must be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
[1] NRCS's TR-55: limited to 100 acres in size.
[2] NRCS's TR-20 or HEC-HMS: no size limitations.
[3] Other models as preapproved by the Municipal Engineer.
(b) The NRCS Antecedent Runoff Condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to 1/10 of
a cubic foot per second (cfs).
F. Runoff coefficients.
(1) Rational Method. Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).192
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. Use Table C-2 (Appendix C).193
Curve numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in
hydrologic models as they are a design tool with statistical
variability. For large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded to
the nearest whole number.
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious areas conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow (good condition).
G. Twenty-four-hour design storm.
(1) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-year, two-year, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and onehundred-
year hydrographs through the facility using the Storage
Indication Method or Modified Puls Method. The twenty-four-hour
design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph.
(2) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
192. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
193. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 371-21 CHARTER § 371-21
C:397
(3) All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway.
H. Time of concentration.
(1) The time of concentration is to represent the average condition that
best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following
time of concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be
used unless another method is preapproved by the Municipal
Engineer:
(a) Predevelopment. NRCS's Lag Equation:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/0.6) * 60] (minutes)
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by:
S = [(1000/CN) - 10]
CN = NRCS Curve Number for watershed
(b) Post-development; commercial, industrial, or other areas with
large impervious areas (>20% impervious area) - NRCS
Segmental Method. The length of sheet flow shall be limited to
100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's Equation.
(c) Post-development; residential, cluster, or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area - NRCS Lag
Equation or NRCS Segmental Method.
(2) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The post-development Tc shall never be greater that the
predevelopment Tc for any watershed or subwatershed. This
includes when the designer has specifically used swales to
reduce flow velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the post-development Tc is greater, it will still be set by
default equal to the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
(b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
§ 371-21 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 371-21
C:398
§ 371-22. Landscape requirements for stormwater facilities.
Landscaping should be provided for all proposed stormwater detention/
retention areas located within the Township in an effort to mitigate any
incompatibility or aesthetic issues they may cause. The required
landscaping in this section shall not be counted towards the landscaping
requirements of any other section. Refer to Chapter 440, Zoning, and
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute Tc for any
post-development watershed or subwatershed without
providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc cannot be assumed
for predevelopment.
(e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of Tc calculation.
I. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining predevelopment flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to reduce peak runoff rates in the postdevelopment
analysis. New, additional contributing runoff should not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
J. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's Equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. The Manning's Equation should not
be used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from PennDOT's
Drainage Manual, Publication 584. Inlet control shall be checked at all
inlet boxes to ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design
event is contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
K. Peters Township may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.
L. Peters Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and recommendation of Peters
Township.
§ 371-21 CHARTER § 371-22
C:399
Chapter 385, Subdivision and Land Development, of the Peters Township
Code of Ordinances, for additional requirements.
A. Two different planting schemes have been developed to address
different site environments and surroundings. Developers are
encouraged to review proposed stormwater facilities with the Peter's
Township Planning Department to determine which planting scenario is
best for their proposed improvements.
(1) Open/developed area scenario. This design should be used for
areas where a more groomed and manicured appearance is desired
such as within an office park, retail development or adjacent to a
housing development.
(a) Required trees. One shade tree per 30 linear feet of pond
circumference shall be planted on the outside perimeter of the
stormwater pond. Trees shall be randomly placed up and down
the bank and may be grouped. A variety of evergreen and
deciduous trees shall be used which shall come from the
"Recommended Plant List for Peters Township," or as approved
by the Township. One third of the proposed trees shall be
evergreen, and 2/3 of the proposed trees shall be deciduous.
Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height, and
deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two inches' caliper. In
those circumstances outside of the developer's control that
make it impractical to fully meet this requirement, it may be
modified by the Township.
(b) Required seeding. Ernst Seeding Mix No. 126 Retention Basin
Floor Seeding, or approved equal, shall be planted on the floor
and on the inside banks of the proposed detention pond.
(2) Naturalized/wooded area scenario. This design should be used for
areas where a more naturalized look is desired such as at the edge
of the woods.
(a) Required trees. One shade tree per 30 linear feet of pond
circumference shall be planted on the outside perimeter of the
stormwater pond. Trees shall be randomly placed up and down
the bank and may be grouped. A variety of evergreen and
deciduous trees shall be used which shall come from the
"Recommended Plant List for Peters Township," or as approved
by the Township. One third of the proposed trees shall be
evergreen, and 2/3 of the proposed trees shall be deciduous.
Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height and
deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two inches' caliper. In
this particular scenario, existing trees to remain of greater or
equal caliper may be substituted for the required trees upon
approval by the Township's landscape architect. Trees and root
systems must be properly protected during construction
activities with no construction activity occurring within the
§ 371-22 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 371-22
C:400
dripline of the trees. In those circumstances outside of the
developer's control that make it impractical to fully meet this
requirement, it may be modified by the Township.
(b) Required seeding. Ernst Seeding Mix No. 180 Rain Garden
Mix, or approved equal, shall be planted on the floor and on the
inside banks of the proposed detention pond.

the applicant signing and recording the stormwater maintenance
agreement (Appendix A199) covering all stormwater control facilities
that are to be privately owned.
(1) Municipalities are exempt from the requirement to sign and record
an agreement.
B. Other items may be included in the stormwater maintenance
agreement where determined necessary to guarantee the satisfactory
operation and maintenance of all BMP facilities. The agreement shall be
subject to the review and approval of Peters Township and the
Municipal Solicitor.

Assessments for Improvements
[Adopted 12-7-1971 by Ord. No. 114 (Ch. 21, Part 1A, of the 1981
Code of Ordinances)]
§ 376-1. Policy. [Amended 4-13-1981 by Ord. No. 235]
The Council hereby adopts the policy of permitting assessments for street,
sewer, curbing and sidewalk improvements to be paid on an installment
basis.
§ 376-2. Time period for payment. [Amended 4-13-1981 by Ord. No.
235]
Payments shall be made over a period of five years or at such earlier time
or period as the Council and the property owner who is assessed otherwise
decide by agreement.
§ 376-3. Monthly basis.203
Equal payments shall be made on a monthly basis with each installment
bearing interest at the current CPI-U rate at the time the assessment is
made, not to exceed 6%.
§ 376-4. Rights reserved by Township.
The Township in authorizing payments in installments does not release or
relinquish any of its rights to file appropriate municipal liens or to obtain
payment and all other costs and charges to which it may be entitled under
the Home Rule Charter in the event that a property owner defaults in an
installment payment.
§ 376-5. "Default" defined.
For purposes of this article, a "default" shall not exist unless or until a
period of 60 days has elapsed from the date on which the last installment
payment is due and owing.
§ 376-6. Shortening of payment period. [Amended 4-13-1981 by
Ord. No. 235]
The five-year period of payment referred to in § 376-2 is the maximum
period authorized under this article and may be shortened or modified by
the Council in instances where a consideration of the assessment involved
indicates that a shorter time period is more appropriate. In the event that
the time for payment is shortened, other than by agreement between the
property owner involved and the Township, such action may be taken by
motion or resolution at a regularly scheduled Council meeting.

ARTICLE II
Private Street Acceptance
[Adopted 8-2-1976 by Ord. No. 160 (Ch. 21, Part 1B, of the 1981
Code of Ordinances)]
§ 376-7. Policy.
The Township Council of Peters Township hereby enunciates and adopts the
policy of accepting as many existing roads and/or streets as possible in the
Township into the Township road system.
§ 376-8. Investigation of existing private roads.
In situations where a given road which has been heretofore classified or
referred to as a "private road" is to be considered for acceptance into the
road system, an initial investigation shall be conducted by the Township
and such investigation shall be designed to determine whether or not the
road has ever been formally accepted by Township resolution; whether the
road or street is part of a subdivision which has been recorded in the
Recorder's Office of Washington County and which contains dedications
and/or releases of damages, or whether the road or street has, in fact,
been used on a regular basis by the public, giving rise to an acceptance by
implication and by public user. After this investigation has been completed,
a recommendation shall be made to Council as to whether or not the road
can be incorporated into the road system. If the investigation establishes
that legal impediments exist which prevent the acceptance of the road or
street or which may give rise to damages in the event the road or street
is accepted, Council may, if it feels such action is appropriate, authorize
and allocate such funds as may be necessary to acquire the necessary
consents, waivers, rights-of-way, or releases which will alleviate the legal
impediments and enable the Township to accept the road or street into the
road system.
§ 376-9. Acceptance procedure. [Amended 2-28-1996 by Ord. No.
523]
The Council shall consider accepting a private road into the Township road
system or effectuating the procedure outlined in § 376-8 of this article when
it shall receive a petition requesting the acceptance of the street involved
into the Township road system executed by a majority of the property
owners who abut on the street or portion of street which is being considered
for acceptance, or in such other situations as Council, in its discretion, shall
deem appropriate after analysis of the circumstances surrounding the use
of the road and its potential to enhance the public safety and welfare.
§ 376-10. Justification of expenditure of municipal funds.
Even though this may ultimately result in the expenditure of municipal
funds, the overall objective is of such importance to the growth of the
Township that Council shall be authorized to allocate from the general fund
§ 376-7 CHARTER § 376-10
C:429
such amounts as may be necessary to implement the project, and such
funds may be used, by way of illustration, to acquire deeds of dedication,
easements and rights-of-way and to obtain releases and waivers of damage
in order to remove the legal impediments preventing the acceptance of a
given street.
§ 376-11. Individual investigation; legal report; estimate of costs.
The Council shall treat a proposed street or road which is to be incorporated
into the Township road system on an individual basis and shall investigate
the facts surrounding the issue of whether the Township has a legal basis
for accepting the road and/or street into its road system. The Council shall
then request the Township Solicitor to make a recommendation as to the
appropriate legal approach which can be utilized in a given circumstance
to accomplish this objective, together with an estimate of the possible
damages and costs involved in taking over the specific individual road and/
or street involved.
§ 376-12. Decision by Council.
Upon receipt of this information, the Council shall make a definitive
decision whether, in light of the legal problems and the estimated costs
involved, the road and/or street shall be further considered for acceptance.
If an affirmative decision is reached, the Council shall establish the
procedure to be followed and shall authorize the expenditure of such funds
as may be necessary to carry out this procedure.
§ 376-13. Review by Engineer and Solicitor.
In arriving at its decision, the Council may authorize the Township Engineer
and the Township Solicitor to review each proposed road or street from
an engineering and legal standpoint. This review may include, but not
necessarily be limited to, a consideration of the costs of improving the street
and/or road and of acquiring the necessary deeds of dedication, easements,
rights-of-way, releases and waivers of damages.
§ 376-14. Cost responsibility.
Whenever appropriate, all of the costs of accepting the road and/or street
into the Township road system, including, but not necessarily limited to,
the legal fees, the engineering charges, the costs of securing and recording
appropriate deeds of dedication, easements, rights-of-way, releases and
waivers of damages, together with such other administrative expenses as
may result, shall be apportioned equitably against all involved property
owners pursuant to law and consistent with the Township's established
policy. If this is not possible because of legal impediments or otherwise not
feasible, then and in that event, such amounts as may be necessary may be
appropriated out of the general fund to accomplish these objectives.
§ 376-10 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 376-15
C:430
§ 376-15. Implied acceptance by public user.
When the acceptance of a particular road and/or street requires an implied
acceptance by public user, the appropriate municipal officials shall
determine such facts as are available and the Council shall either hold
a public hearing or place the matter on the agenda of a regular Council
meeting, at which time documentation and evidence may be introduced into
the record on the issue. Township residents and interested parties shall be
authorized to offer such evidence as may be appropriate in the premises and
an overall determination shall be made as to whether or not there has been
an implied dedication of acceptance by public user which will authorize
legal acceptance of the road and/or street into the Township road system.
§ 376-16. Acceptance procedure.
The procedure which shall be adopted for considering whether or not to
accept a particular street and/or road into the Township road system shall
conform in all respects, except as otherwise specifically outlined herein,
to the procedure utilized in considering curative amendments submitted to
the Council as far as hearings, the production of documents, the taking of
testimony and the submission of evidence are concerned.
§ 376-17. Record of testimony.
In the event a hearing is held, or the matter is placed on the agenda, a
verbatim record will be made of all testimony and comments which are
made, and all documentation shall be appropriately marked as exhibits and
kept in a separate file pertaining to the road and/or street involved.
§ 376-18. Liquid fuel tax requirements to be met.
Any street, road, or part thereof, accepted under this Article II into the
Township road system, shall comply with the minimum requirements of
PennDOT, covering the allocation of liquid fuel tax receipts and the
standards promulgated in connection therewith.
§ 376-19. Improvements.
The Township, upon appropriate action by the Council, may grade, curb,
gutter, pave or otherwise improve with brick, stone or any suitable
materials, any public street, road, or part thereof, laid out and opened in
the Township, accepted by formal resolution or declared in appropriate
proceeding to be a public road by virtue of public user. Such work may
be done by employees of the Township or by contract, as the Council shall
determine. No street, road, or any part thereof shall be improved under the
provisions of this Article II except upon the petitions of a majority of the
owners of property abutting on the street, road, or part thereof proposed to
be improved.
§ 376-15 CHARTER § 376-20
C:431
§ 376-20. Improvement cost assessments.
The costs and expenses of any such improvement may be collected from the
owners of the real estate abutting on such street, road, or part thereof by
an equal assessment on the feet front. Such assessment shall be estimated
by the Township Engineer, or if there be no Township Engineer, by other
competent authority designated by Council. If this standard of assessment
is impracticable, or for any reason inequitable, the Township Engineer, or
other competent authority designated by Council, shall adopt such other
method of assessment as may be legally acceptable and equitable in the
premises.
§ 376-21. Utility line considerations.
Prior to improving any street, road, or part thereof, an investigation shall
be conducted under the direction of the Township Engineer to determine
the possible existence of utility lines under the street, road, or part thereof,
proposed to be improved and the said street, road, or part thereof, shall not
be improved unless or until appropriate steps are taken to either remove the
utility lines or to otherwise alleviate the problem in a manner satisfactory to
the Township Engineer.
§ 376-22. Additional regulations.
Council shall also establish such other procedures and adopt such
regulations as may be appropriate in the premises to effectuate the general
intent of this Article II.

Unlawful Deposits
[Adopted 4-3-1978 by Ord. No. 181 (Ch. 21, Part 3, of the 1981 Code
of Ordinances)]
§ 376-23. Unlawful deposits.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, organization or other entity to
deposit, place, divert or otherwise cause to be placed any liquid or
particulate matter, including, but not limited to, snow, ice, water, refuse,
debris, dirt, grass, or leaves upon any street, road, highway, lane or alley
within Peters Township.
§ 376-24. Violations and penalties. [Amended 4-13-1981 by Ord. No.
235204]
Any person who violates or permits a violation of this article shall, upon
conviction in a summary proceeding brought before a Magisterial District
Judge under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, be guilty of a
summary offense and shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000,
plus costs of prosecution. In default of payment thereof, the defendant may
be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days. Each day
or portion thereof that such violation continues or is permitted to continue
shall constitute a separate offense, and each section of this article that is
violated shall also constitute a separate offense.

completed and to monitor compliance with the permit and this article
shall be as set by Township Council by resolution.206
C. Additional fees. The Township reserves the right to have a full- or parttime
third-party inspector present with the cost being borne by the
applicant. If the Township anticipates that the cost of inspecting the
permitted work will exceed the inspection fees listed in this section by a
significant amount, the following additional fees will be assessed:
(1) Additional inspection fees. If the Township determines that the
permitted work is of sufficient magnitude or importance to warrant
assignment of one or more persons to inspect the permitted work
on a more than spot-inspection basis, the permit will so indicate
and the permittee shall be charged for additional salary, overhead
and expenses incurred by the Township for inspection. Inspection
costs will be estimated at an hourly rate at the time of permit
issuance. The applicant will then establish an inspection escrow
account with the Township by way of certified check. Third-party
inspection charges to the Township will be paid for from this
escrow account. All expenditures which exceed this amount will be
paid by the applicant. Any balance remaining will be refunded to
the applicant.
(2) Invoices. The Township will provide an itemized invoice for thirdparty
inspection services charged to the Township within 30 days
upon request.
A. General rule. Upon approval of an application submitted under this
chapter, a permit will be issued by the Township, subject to this chapter
and the conditions contained in the permit and its attachments and
supplements. The permit shall be the applicant's authority to proceed
with the work specified in the permit. A copy of the permit and relevant
plans shall be available at the work site for review.
B. Financial security.
(1) Performance security. No permit shall be issued until the applicant
shall have first furnished the Township with financial security for
the proper restoration of the work authorized by such permit in the
amount of not less than $1,000, specific amount to be determined
by the Township Engineer prior to permit issuance. In lieu of
providing security with each application, an applicant may post
with the Township a performance security of $10,000; the validity
of such security shall be reviewed annually at the beginning of each
calendar year. In cases of anticipated projects of unusual
magnitude, the Township may require security in excess of $10,000
as a condition of permit issuance. Bonding and permit fees for

(a) If more than 100 linear feet of longitudinal opening is made in
the pavement, the Township will require the permittee to mill
and overlay traffic lanes in which the opening was made, for
the entire length of highway that was opened.

General Provisions
§ 385-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "The Peters Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance."
§ 385-2. Purpose.
This chapter is established for the purpose of assuring sites suitable for
building purposes and human habitation; to provide for the harmonious
development of the Township, in accordance with the Comprehensive
Development Plan; for the coordination of existing development with
proposed development within the Township; and for adequate open spaces,
for proper traffic flows, recreation, light and air, and for proper distribution
of population, thereby creating conditions favorable to the health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the citizens.
§ 385-3. Subdivision and land development control.
Hereafter, no activity covered by these regulations shall be permitted; no
land shall be subdivided (See definition for "subdivision.");212 no land shall
be developed (See definition for "land development."); no improvements to
land (See definition.) shall be laid out, constructed, opened or dedicated
for public use or travel, or for the common use of occupants of buildings
or properties abutting thereon, except in strict accordance with the
requirements and procedures of this chapter.
§ 385-4. Incorporation of other provisions.
The Peters Township Zoning Ordinance213 and other applicable ordinances
and regulations of the Township are incorporated herein and made a part
hereof by reference.
§ 385-5. Conflict with other provisions.
Whenever there is a difference between the minimum standards specified
herein and those included in other Township ordinances and regulations,
the more stringent requirements shall apply.
§ 385-6. Conformance to Comprehensive Plan.
The layout or arrangement of the subdivision or land development shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan and to any regulations or maps adopted
in furtherance thereof.
212. Editor's Note: For the definitions referenced in this section, see § 385-13.
213. Editor's Note: See Ch. 440, Zoning.
§ 385-1 CHARTER § 385-7
C:465
§ 385-7. Effect of regulations.
Hereafter, no lot in a subdivision may be sold; no permit to erect any
building upon land in a subdivision may be issued; no cuts, grading or filling
permitted; no street, walkway, curbs, gutters, streetlight, fire hydrants,
shade trees, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, waterline or other improvements
as may be required shall be constructed, until the improvements required
herein have been constructed or guaranteed in accordance with §§ 385-32
to 385-40 of this chapter.
§ 385-8. Effect of noncompliance.
Hereafter, except as provided in this chapter, any plat of any subdivision,
street or development of land not approved by the Planning Commission or
the Council in accordance with the provisions and procedures as set forth
herein shall be null and void.
§ 385-9. Effect on prior applications or approvals.
A. From the time an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary
or final, is duly filed as provided in this chapter and while such
application is pending approval or disapproval, no change or
amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or
plan shall affect the decision on such application adversely to the
applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in accordance
with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they stood
at the time the application was duly filed.
B. In addition, when a preliminary application has been duly approved, the
applicant shall be entitled to final approval in accordance with the
terms of the approved preliminary application as hereinafter provided.
However, if an application is properly and finally denied, any
subsequent application shall be subject to the intervening change in
governing regulations.
C. When application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or final,
has been approved without conditions or approved subject to conditions
acceptable to the applicant, no subsequent change or amendment in the
zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be
applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence and
to complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance
with the terms of such approval within five years from such approval.
Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the five-year
period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary approval. In
the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary approval, the
terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time when the application for
such approval was duly filed.
D. Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plat within the aforesaid five-
§ 385-7 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 385-9
C:466
§ 385-10. Separation of ownership.
year limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the Council,
no change of municipal ordinance or plan enacted subsequent to the
date of filing of the preliminary plat shall modify or revoke any aspect
of the approved final plat pertaining to zoning classification or density,
lot, building, street or utility location.
E. In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by
the landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed
sections, as well as deadlines, within which applications for final plat
approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be
updated annually by the applicant on or before the anniversary of the
preliminary plat approval, until final plat approval of the final section
has been granted and any modification in the aforesaid schedule shall
be subject to approval of the Council in its discretion. Each section in
any residential subdivision or land development, except for the last
section, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the total number of dwelling
units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser percentage is
approved by the Council in its discretion. Provided the landowner has
not defaulted with regard to or violated any of the conditions of the
preliminary plat approval, including compliance with the landowner's
aforesaid schedule of submission of final plats for the various sections,
then the aforesaid protections afforded by substantially completing the
improvements depicted upon the final plat within five years shall apply
and for any section or sections, beyond the initial section, in which the
required improvements have not been substantially completed within
said five-year period the aforesaid protections shall apply for an
additional term or terms of three years from the date of final plat
approval for each section. Failure of the landowner to adhere to the
aforesaid schedule of submission of final plats for the various sections
shall subject any such section to any and all changes in zoning,
subdivision and other governing ordinance enacted by the Township
subsequent to the date of the initial preliminary plan submission.
F. These provisions shall apply to any land development or subdivision
filed on or after August 9, 1982. Any subdivision or land development
for which preliminary plans were approved by a municipality within the
five-year period immediately preceding August 9, 1982, shall not be
adversely affected by any intervening or subsequent change in
municipal ordinances or plans pertaining to zoning subsequent to
submission of the preliminary plat, provided the landowner has
commenced or does commence, installation of the improvements
depicted upon the approved final plat within three years of approval of
same.
A. At no time shall any portion of any land development be separated from
the ownership of the entire tract of development without the review of
the Planning Commission and approval of the Council. Such approval
§ 385-9 CHARTER § 385-10
C:467
§ 385-11. Authority for modifications.
shall constitute a "subdivision" as provided for in this chapter, and
shall take into consideration: the nature of land development under the
original plan; the performance of the developer to date, including his
ability to meet past obligations to either the Township or his tenants;
and the nature of the proposed ownership as related to the future
maintenance of land and buildings.
B. Any separation of ownership within a land development shall be
considered a "condominium" as defined in this chapter and the
requirements set forth in the FHA Series 1400 Suggested Legal
Documents for Planned Unit Developments (April 1973, or as amended)
and the Uniform Condominium Act, 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 3101 et seq., shall be
considered minimum standards for the establishment of a condominium
association, and the Planning Commission may, in its discretion, require
additional information and documentation from the applicant to
establish that an appropriate plan shall be formulated to adequately
assure the continued maintenance of the common areas. The final
decision as to the propriety of the maintenance guarantee or the plan
formulated by the applicant shall rest with the Council.214
A. Procedural modifications. Where an applicant feels that extraordinary
hardship results from strict compliance with § 385-3 of this chapter, a
written application may be submitted to the Council requesting a
hearing and modification of the requirements to accommodate the
specific hardship. Such a request shall accompany and be a part of the
application for development. The application shall state in full the
grounds of unreasonableness or undue hardship on which the request is
based, the provision(s) of the ordinance involved, and the minimum
modification necessary. If the Council determines that, by modification
of the requirements, substantial justice may be done, and the public
interest may be secured, and the granting of such modifications will not
be detrimental to other property in the vicinity, the Council may grant
such modifications, provided that same will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of the spirit of these regulations. The
Council shall keep a written record of all action on all such requests for
modifications of the requirements.
B. Substantive modifications. The Planning Commission may recommend
to the Council departures from any of the provisions and requirements
set forth in §§ 385-32 to 385-40 of this chapter when, in the opinion of
the Planning Commission, an alternative standard has been
demonstrated to provide equal or better results in accordance with
modern and evolving principles of site planning and development. A
written application from the subdivider or developer shall state in full
the grounds on which the request is based, the provision(s) of the
214. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 385-10 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 385-11
C:468
ordinance involved and the minimum modification necessary. The
decision of the Council of Peters Township shall be final.
C. Exemption from recorded plat for land development.
(1) Subsequent to the preapplication conference with the Planning
Department staff, a recommendation shall be prepared by the staff
to the Planning Commission as to whether a land development (See
definition.215) may be eligible for a procedural modification by
exempting the land development from the requirement of
submitting preliminary plans and plats for recording if such a
modification is being requested by the developer. This
recommendation for an exemption shall be based on a review of the
following site conditions:
(a) The need for the dedication of additional right-of-way or new
rights-of-way.
(b) The need to record or revise existing easements or new
easements for public sanitary sewers or storm sewers, public
utilities, or stormwater management facilities.
(c) The need to install public streets and/or other public
improvements.
(d) The need to combine two or more parcels, or the need to
establish lease lines or ownership/mortgage lines.
(2) If, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, no recorded plat
should be required, the applicant may be exempt from the
submission of plans required by these regulations.

A. Submission to the Council.
(1) When a final plat has been officially approved by the Township
Planning Commission, and all construction drawings have been
approved by the Township Engineer, such plat shall be placed on
the agenda of the Council. In the event that conditions were placed
on the Planning Commission's approval, the final plat shall not be
§ 385-28 CHARTER § 385-29
C:501
placed on the Council agenda until the applicant has responded as
required in § 385-28B(1).
(2) Submission to the Council shall include the estimate for the public
improvements prepared by the Township Engineer or the
applicant's engineer as stated on the original application.
B. Review.
(1) At a regularly scheduled meeting, the Council shall review the final
plats and the written reports thereon of the Township Planning
Commission and other officials and agencies.
(2) Before acting on any subdivision or land development plat, the
Council may hold a public hearing thereon after public notice.
C. Action.
(1) Action by the Council may be favorable (approving the application),
unfavorable (disapproving the application), or favorable with
conditions on approval of the application of which the plats form a
part. The decision of the Council shall be in writing and shall be
communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him at his
last known address not later than 15 days following the decision.
The Council shall render its decision and communicate it to the
applicant not later than 90 days after the final plat application is
filed with the Township Planning Commission in accordance with
this chapter. (See § 385-24A for explanation of ninety-day period.)
(2) If the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision
shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite
the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.

Council shall be noted, together with the date of action, and the
signature of the Chairman on the original of the plat.
(4) If the subdivision and/or land development is approved subject to
conditions, these conditions must be set forth either with note(s) on
the recorded plan or in a subdivision agreement, in which case the
developer shall sign the plan and/or agreement within 21 days of
the Council's action on the plat to indicate the acceptance of all
conditions. The developer's failure to sign within 21 days shall
result in the automatic rescinding of the Council's approval of the
plat.
(5) If the subdivision and/or land development requires construction of
improvements, the subdivision agreement shall specify all
conditions of approval, including provisions that the subdivider or
developer shall:
§ 385-29 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 385-29
C:502
(a) Prior to construction, record the plat with the Recorder of
Deeds of Washington County within 90 days of approval by the
Council and that if the subdivider or developer fails to record
the final plat within such period, the action of Peters Township
shall be null and void, unless an extension of time is granted in
writing by the Township upon written request by the
subdivider or developer. The subdivider or developer shall
deliver six prints of the recorded plat to the Township.
(b) Lay out and improve the streets, sanitary sewers, if required,
and construct all of the improvements, including necessary
stormwater management facilities and grading, paving, curbs,
gutters, and other street improvements including storm sewers
and any other improvements required by this chapter. The
subdivider or developer shall also erect such monuments as
have been approved on the final plat and any required
waterlines and fire hydrants which were part of the approval.
(c) Prior to release of the plat for recording, furnish a bond or
other approved financial security in accordance with § 385-43
of this chapter to guarantee the performance of said contract
and to secure the completion of said improvements to the

hours before the contemplated installation or performance of
any work requiring Township inspection as outlined in § 385-44
of this chapter.
(f) Pay the entire cost of said improvements, as herein above set
forth, to the contractor(s) promptly upon completion of said
work; and shall also pay the cost of supervision and inspection
by the Township Engineer in charge thereof.
(g) Submit to the Township all required documents and plans for
the acceptance of streets and public improvements as required
in § 385-45 of this chapter.
(h) Include in the agreement any specific matter which the
subdivider or developer shall perform and which are not shown
in the plans or drawings.
(i) Covenant and agree to indemnify and save harmless Peters

any person or corporation by reason of negligence in the
conduct of the work herein referred to, or for any reason
§ 385-29 CHARTER § 385-29
C:503
whatsoever arising from the performance by the subdivider or
developer of the provisions of this agreement.
(j) Within one year from the recording date of the plat, complete
the installation of all improvements in accordance with the
approved plat and specifications of Peters Township. Except
that, should it become evident that any street in a partially
completed plat of lots may be extensively used by heavy
vehicles hauling building materials and equipment, and where
such street, if completed, may be damaged during the course
of construction of a number of buildings, the Township may
require the developer or builder to complete the buildings or a
substantial number of them prior to the final paving of the
street.
(k) The subdivider or developer shall be jointly liable with the
subcontractor and/or general contractor for whom said person
or his superiors work, or with whom they have contracted, for
any damage to any Township road, including the paved area,
gutters, utilities and the right-of-way, and shall repair said
damage within 90 days of written demand by the Township,

repairs shall meet Township standards and shall be subject to
Township inspection.
(l) Other conditions as set forth in the approval by the Council.
(m) Execute maintenance agreements for privately owned
stormwater management facilities in accordance with § 371-43
of the Code of Peters Township.
(n) If there is a case where land development is not intended for
the immediate erection of buildings, where streets, curbs,
gutters, fire hydrants, water and sewage facilities and other
improvements may not be possible to install as a condition
precedent to final approval of plats, the Council shall instruct
the Township Solicitor to prepare an agreement, providing that
the subdivider or developer shall commit himself to the above
agreements as a condition precedent to the erection of
building(s) on land included in the approved plat, at the
subdivider's or developer's expense.
(6) Any plat subject to an agreement shall have a note on the recorded
plan: "Approved for recording purposes only subject to all the
provisions of a contract between the owner(s) and Peters Township,
which is recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds, a copy of
which is on file with the Township."
(7) When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing,
the Township Manager shall furnish the developer with a letter
indicating approval of the final plat by the Council contingent upon
the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final
§ 385-29 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 385-29
C:504
§ 385-30. Recording of final plat.
plat shall not be signed nor recorded until financial security is
posted with the Township. The letter of contingent approval shall
expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security is not
delivered within 90 days unless a written extension is granted by
the Council. Such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and
shall be placed in writing at the request of the developer.
(8) The Township shall retain custody of the original plat until all legal
agreements have been executed; all bonds, escrows, fees, and/or
affidavits have been delivered and other conditions of the approval
have been met; at which time, the original plat will be sealed by the
Township Manager and released for recording. The copy of the
original shall be retained in the Township files until six prints of the
recorded plan are delivered to the Township.
(9) Failure of the Council to render a decision and communicate it to
the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein
shall be deemed as approval of the application in terms as
presented unless the applicant has agreed, in writing, to an
extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation or communication of the decision in which case failure
to meet the extended time or change in the manner of presentation
of communication shall have like effect.
A. Upon the approval of a final plat, the developer shall, within 90 days of
such final approval, record such plat in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds of Washington County. Whenever plat approval is required by a
municipality, the Recorder of Deeds of the County shall not accept any
plat for recording unless such plat officially notes the approval of the
Council.
B. Prior to construction, the subdivider or developer shall deliver six
certified prints of the recorded plat to the Township. A fee shall be
levied as escrow for the delivery of the plats.242
C. If the subdivider fails to record the final plat within such period, the
action of Peters Township shall be null and void, unless an extension of
time is granted in writing by the Township upon written request by the
subdivider or land developer.
D. After a plat has been approved and recorded as required by this
chapter, all streets and public grounds on such plat shall be, and
become, a part of the Official Map of Peters Township without public
hearings.

385-41 to 385-45 of this chapter are intended as the minimum for the
promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare, and shall be
applied as such by the Peters Township Planning Commission and the
Council in reviewing and approving all subdivision or land development
plats.
B. The relationship of the proposed subdivision or development with
previously developed land and undeveloped land in the Township; the
provisions for access to the undeveloped land through any proposed
subdivision or development; the adequacy of existing and proposed
sanitary sewers, stormwater management systems, community
facilities, park, playground, school and recreation areas; and
conformity to the Comprehensive Plan, to the Zoning Ordinance,243 and
to other applicable ordinances of the Township, shall all be considered
in the review and approval of any subdivision or land development plat.
C. Whenever other Township regulations, or state laws or statutes impose
more restrictive standards and requirements than those contained
herein, such other regulations shall be observed.
D. Although they may not be represented on the plat, the developer shall
take cognizance of the fact that the Peters Township Zoning Ordinance
contains design standards that shall be taken into consideration in his
design, and which will later be submitted in the form of site or plot
plans prior to the issuance of building permits.
A. Preservation of natural features. A subdivider or developer shall make
every effort to preserve shade trees, other salient natural features,
keep cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and adequately
handle the volume and velocity of surface runoff. Wooded slopes of 25%
or greater shall be protected by a recorded conservation easement
which permits only the construction of a dwelling and accessory
structures permitted under the zoning regulations.
B. Subsidence. Land subject to subsidence or underground fires either
shall be made safe for the purpose for which it is to be used, or such
land shall be set aside for uses which shall not endanger life or property
or further aggravate or increase the existing menace.

No. 438; 7-8-1992 by Ord. No. 452]
A. Blocks.
(1) Layout. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined
with due regard to provision of adequate sites for buildings of the
type proposed; any other zoning requirements; topography, and
street intersection requirements as outlined in § 385-37 of this
chapter.
(2) Length in residential districts.
(a) Blocks shall have a minimum length of 300 feet.
(b) In the design of blocks (fronting on minor streets) longer than
1,000 feet, special consideration shall be given to the
requirements of satisfactory fire protection.
(c) Where practicable, blocks along arterial and collector streets
shall not be less than 1,000 feet long.
(3) Length in commercial and industrial districts. Blocks in commercial
and industrial areas may vary from the elements of design detailed
above, if required by the nature of the use. Any subdivision of land
or land development in the Commercial or Industrial Districts shall
take into consideration the feasibility of creating marginal or
feeder roads to minimize intersections with major roads. In all
cases, however, adequate provisions shall be made for off-street
parking and loading areas, as well as for traffic circulation and
parking for employees and customers. The regulations in the Peters
Township Zoning Ordinance251 are incorporated herein by
reference.
(4) Depth. Residential blocks, including those for multifamily
developments, shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two
tiers of lots, except: where double frontage lots are required along
a major traffic street; where prevented by the size, topographical
conditions or other inherent conditions of property, in which case
the Peters Township Planning Commission may approve a single
tier of lots.
B. Lots and parcels.
(1) General standards.
(a) The design and layout of the lots and parcels of a subdivision or
land development should demonstrate flexibility, economy and
ingenuity in accordance with modern and evolving principles
of site planning and development.
251. Editor's Note: See Ch. 440, Zoning.
§ 385-36 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 385-36
C:512
(b) The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for
the type of development and use contemplated.
(c) Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
(d) Where feasible, lot lines shall follow municipal boundaries
rather than cross them, in order to avoid jurisdictional
problems. Excessive depth in lots shall be avoided and
excessive irregularity in lots shall be avoided. Generally, the
depth of residential lots shall be not less than one or more than
2 1/2 times their width.
(e) Depth and width of parcels intended for apartments and
nonresidential use shall be adequate for the use proposed and
sufficient to provide satisfactory space for on-site parking,
loading and unloading, setbacks, landscaping, and other
zoning requirements.
(f) If, after subdividing or developing, there exist remnants of
land, they shall be incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or
legally dedicated to public use, if acceptable to the Township.
(2) Lot size. Lot dimensions and areas shall be not less than specified
by the provisions of the district in which they are located.
(3) Lot or parcel frontage.
(a) All lots or parcels shall have direct access to a public or private
street as provided for in § 385-37, Streets. Double frontage lots
shall be avoided except where required to provide separation
of residential uses from major streets, or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography or orientation. Such lots shall
have vehicular access solely from the street where the lot
width requirement is being met, excluding service streets. Lot
width shall be as specified by the provisions of the district in
which the lot is located and shall be measured at the minimum
building setback line. Except for previously recorded lots of
record, new subdivision or land development in the
Commercial and Industrial Districts shall not be permitted to
have individual driveway access on streets classified as
arterials or collectors and shall provide collective access in the
form of new streets or service streets only. [Amended
5-13-2019 by Ord. No. 842]
(b) Except for previously recorded lots of record, newly created
residential lots or parcels shall not be permitted to have direct
driveway access on streets classified as arterials or collectors.
(c) Street classification shall be determined by the Official Map,
the Comprehensive Plan or the Planning Commission.

(4) Lot or parcel numbers. Lot numbers or lettered parcels shall be
assigned and approved prior to filing the final subdivision and/or
land development plat.
(5) Building setback lines on lots and parcels. Building lines on lots or
parcels from street rights-of-way (public or private) shall not be
less than those required by the district in which they are located
and shall be established in accordance with the right-of-way
requirements in § 385-37.
A. General standards. (See appendix to this chapter for diagrams.252)
(1) The location and width of all streets, both public and private, shall
conform to all design standards as provided for in § 385-37,
Streets. Streets to serve new subdivisions shall only be extended
from dedicated public streets. [Amended 5-13-2019 by Ord. No.
842]
(2) All streets intended for public use shall be paved to full cartway
width. In all cases, paving materials and workmanship shall
conform to any and all Township standards, including any
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards where state
roads or rights-of-way are involved.
(3) The proposed street system shall extend existing dedicated public
streets at the same width, but in no case at less than the required
minimum width, and be so located to allow proper development of
surrounding properties. Where streets abut undeveloped property,
contours on the undeveloped land shall be provided for a distance
of 100 feet to assess the transition for future development.
(4) Where a subdivision or land development abuts an existing street
of improper width or alignment, the Township may require the
dedication of land sufficient to widen the street, or correct the
alignment and may require the half abutting the plan be improved
to Township specifications.
(5) Where the abutting street is rural (paved and with an adequate
base as determined by the Township, but lacking curbs and storm
drains), the Township may permit the improvement of the road to
the rural specification in the appendix of this chapter.253
(6) Minor streets shall be laid out so as to discourage through traffic.
Connector and collector streets should be provided to adequately
provide for the expected flow of traffic from minor streets.

260. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 385-37 CHARTER § 385-37
C:521
constructed along or crossing state-owned roads shall conform to
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation specifications for such
facilities.
N. Traffic calming.
(1) Purpose.
(a) Proactive design criteria for new public minor streets shall
encourage and maintain maximum vehicle operating speeds
less than 30 miles per hour (mph) in residential subdivisions.
For design speed purposes, minor streets in residential
subdivisions shall be designed to a design speed of 20 mph
with a speed limit of 25 mph. These criteria shall employ traffic
calming measures in order to achieve this objective.
(b) The Institute of Transportation Engineers defines traffic
calming as follows: "Traffic calming is the combination of
mainly physical measures that reduce the negative effects of
motor vehicle use, alter driver behavior and improve
conditions for nonmotorized street users."
(c) Towards that end, the following general and specific design
criteria shall be employed in every new residential subdivision
in the Township.
(2) Types/design standards of traffic calming devices.
(a) Horizontal traffic calming devices include but are not limited
to:
[1] Low-speed curves. (See Drawing TC-02 in Appendix A.261)
[a] Research has shown that one of the major influential
factors in controlling operational speeds on
residential streets is horizontal curvature. To
encourage operational speeds in line with desirable
expectations, low-speed curves are recommended. A
minimum and a maximum radius shall be provided as
follows:
261. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 385-37 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 385-37
C:522
Delta Angle
(Minimum of
30°)
Radius
(Assumes normal crown -
2%)
Between 30° to 40° 100 feet (minimum/maximum)
ADT <400 vpd;
110 feet (minimum/maximum)
ADT >400 vpd
Between 41° to 50° 120 feet (minimum) to 130 feet
(maximum)
Greater than or
equal to 51°
120 feet (minimum) to 150 feet
(maximum)
[b] The length of tangents between successive low-speed
curves should not exceed 500 feet. Larger horizontal
curve radii are permitted within residential
subdivision; however, radii that exceed the above
design values shall not be considered speed control
points.
[2] Traffic circles. (See Drawings TC-03 and TC-04 in
Appendix A.262)
[a] Traffic circles are raised islands located in the center
of an unsignalized intersection. They are landscaped
with ground cover to provide aesthetic appeal. Traffic
circles reduce speeds due to the horizontal
displacement required to negotiate the intersection.
Traffic circles also reduce conflict points at
intersections. Intersections on streets with a
significant percentage of large vehicles are not
recommended locations for traffic circles.
[b] The minimum diameter of the center island should be
14 feet, inclusive of a two-foot wide mountable truck
apron with a four-percent cross slope and a mountable
curb. Advanced circular intersection and advisory
speed signs shall be installed. The advisory speed
shall be 15 mph. The center of the traffic circle shall
be within an easement maintained by the developer or
homeowners' association with an underlying right-ofway
owned by the Township.
[3] Median islands. (See Drawings TC-05 and TC-05A in
Appendix A.263) Median islands are raised islands placed
between travel lanes that introduce a horizontal

263. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 385-37 CHARTER § 385-37
C:523
displacement to reduce travel speeds. Medians should be
constructed with a truck apron two feet wide with a fourpercent
slope and a mountable curb. Median islands can
also be used at intersections to control vehicle operating
speeds. Minimum island length is 40 feet and the minimum
width is nine feet. Object markers shall be installed at each
end of the island. The center of the median islands shall
be within an easement maintained by the developer or
homeowners' association with an underlying right-of-way
owned by the Township.
[4] Roundabouts. (See Drawing TC-06 in Appendix A.264)
Roundabouts are to be designed in accordance with
PennDOT's Guide to Roundabouts, Publication 414. For
use exclusively within a residential subdivision, the miniroundabout
guidelines are the preferred criteria. For
external intersection gateway treatments, the minimum
acceptable design criteria for the external major street
roadway shall be used.
(b) Vertical traffic calming measures include but are not limited to:
[1] Speed humps. (See Drawing TC-07 in Appendix A.265) A
speed hump is a raised surface on the roadway that is
three inches to four inches in height and 12 feet in length.
[2] Raised crosswalks. (See Drawing TC-08 in Appendix A.266)
[a] Raised crosswalks are elevated pedestrian crossings
that are similar to speed humps with a height of 3 5/8
inches and a length of 22 feet. They can be used in
locations likely to have pedestrian demand such as
neighborhood recreation areas and trails.
[b] Raised crosswalks extend from curb to curb.
Americans with Disabilities Act compliant ramps in
accordance with PennDOT specifications shall be
installed at each end. Drop inlets are required on the
uphill side of the crosswalk for drainage purposes.
Crosswalk markings and pedestrian crosswalk signs
should be installed in accordance with the Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
(3) Spacing and location.
(a) Traffic calming devices in a series shall be placed 300 to 500
feet apart. The maximum length of roadway section between
speed control points shall be 500 feet. The distance between

§ 385-37 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 385-37
C:524
devices should be measured between the points at which the
devices become effective in physically controlling speeds.
While a developer may propose any type of speed control
as defined herein, Township staff shall have final approval of
all proposed speed control devices including their location/
spacing. In addition, the Planning Commission or the Council
may modify any speed control application as part of their
conditions of approval.
(b) The first traffic calming device should usually be located in a
position where it cannot be approached at a high speed from
either direction. To achieve this objective, the first traffic
calming device in a series should be installed within 100 to 200
feet of a low-speed curve or a stop condition. In addition, speed
control points shall be located within 200 feet of all external
subdivision access points.
(4) Landscaping/maintenance of devices. All traffic calming devices
shall include landscaping where practical as part of the initial
construction. Landscaping shall not restrict sight distance for
vehicles traveling on the main street or vehicles on side street
approaches. Landscaping shall be owned/maintained by the
developer or homeowners' association with an easement with an
underlying right-of-way owned by the Township. Failure to properly
maintain landscaping will result in replacement by the Township
with either grass or asphalt pavement. If the Township must
replace the landscaping or provide long-term maintenance, either
the developer or the homeowners' association shall reimburse the
Township for all costs.
(5) Implementation guidelines.
(a) Design modifications. Township staff shall have the ability to
approve any design modifications regarding the location and/
or design of speed control points described herein. Design
modifications do not require approval of the Planning
Commission or the Council; however, either the Planning
Commission or the Council can make specific requirements for
speed control points part of their conditions of approval.
(b) Use of multiple types of treatments encouraged. To allow
flexibility in design and to reduce visual redundancy, different
types of traffic calming devices can be used in a single
development or along an individual street. While a developer
may propose any type of speed control as defined herein,
Township staff shall have final approval of all proposed speed
control devices and their location/spacing. In addition, the
Planning Commission or the Council may modify any speed
control application as part of their conditions of approval. See

(c) Emergency vehicle access. Approved speed control points and
traffic calming devices are intended to allow emergency
vehicles access with minimum added delay. Traffic calming
devices shall not be detrimental to emergency vehicle
operations or access. In addition, fire hydrants must be located
so that alternating one-way traffic flow shall be maintained
around emergency vehicles during minor emergencies.
(6) Standards. For any design criteria not covered herein, refer to the
Township Subdivision and Land Development Regulations and the
most recent edition of the following standards:

facilities; and shall be environmentally hazard free.
Approximately 60% of the land shall be dry ground, not
exceeding the average percent of slope of the development.
The land must also have minimum 50 feet frontage on a public
road, and be served by all utilities.
(d) Land intended to be used for open space rather than park
development shall be aesthetically pleasing and serve some
purpose in the interest of the residents of the development,
i.e., a conservancy area which provides protection of wooded
areas, steep slopes, floodplains, etc. Such areas shall not be
burdened with stormwater management ponds and shall be
environmentally hazard free.
(e) Parcels under five acres in size will generally not be considered
acceptable for parks unless they can be added to existing parks
or potential park land on adjacent tracts, but can be
considered for other types of open space land listed in
Subsection C(1) above.
(3) Review of proposed open space land.
(a) At the time of the preapplication conference § 385-19, the
Parks and Recreation Director and/or Planning Director shall
review with the developer the park, facility or open space
needs in the area where the development is to take place based
on the Needs Study performed in January 1989 and the
Recreation Planning Districts in the Comprehensive Park and
Recreation Plan.
(b) Based on the above evaluation, a recommendation shall be
made to the Parks and Recreation Board concerning the open
space requirement for the particular development. This
§ 385-40 CHARTER § 385-40
C:529
recommendation in such form as may be endorsed by the Parks
and Recreation Board shall be communicated to the developer
and to the Planning Commission. The recommendation may
take the form of a request for park land in a specific section
of the development with specific criteria; a request for fee in
lieu of land dedication; a request for a private reservation of
open space land; a request for the construction of recreational
facilities; or a combination thereof. If the developer agrees
to the fee in lieu of dedication, he shall sign a release form
provided by the Township prior to filing the plan for review
with the Planning Commission. If the developer agrees to
construct facilities, they shall be guaranteed along with other
improvements in the phase in which they are to occur.
(c) Upon the Planning Commission review of the Preliminary Plan
of Subdivision, the above recommendations shall be
incorporated in the plan as approved or as a condition of
approval (§ 385-24).
(4) Establishment of ownership, control and maintenance. The
developer shall dedicate to the Township the future ownership of
the permanent open space land on the final plat unless a private
reservation of land is being made in which case the responsibility
for the burden of maintenance and control shall be placed upon the
private entity retaining ownership. All condominium ownership
shall be in accordance with § 385-10 of this chapter or this section.
[Amended 3-14-2016 by Ord. No. 794]
(5) Fee in lieu of required dedication.
(a) In the event that the developer agrees to pay a fee in lieu of
dedication of land, the amount of the fee shall be substantially
equal to the fair market value of land that would be set aside if
the criteria for site selection for parks specified above were to
be applied.
(b) "Fair market value" shall be determined by the Township
Council as established annually by an MAI appraiser in effect
at the time each final plat is filed for review.
(c) The fee shall be paid to the Township as a condition of approval
of the Phase I final plat or as specified in a schedule of
payment.
D. Conservation Residential (CR) and Mixed Residential (MR) Overlay
Districts. Subdivisions or land developments within the CR or MR
Overlay District shall provide open space as follows: [Added
9-12-2016 by Ord. No. 803]

§ 385-41 CHARTER § 385-43
C:533
A. The developer shall deposit with the Township financial security in an
amount sufficient to cover the costs of any improvements or common
amenities. Without limitation as to other types of financial security
which the Township may approve, federal or commonwealth chartered
lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow
accounts in such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable
financial security. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding
company or federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
chosen by the party posting the financial security, provided said
bonding company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such
business within the commonwealth.
B. Such bond or other security shall provide for and secure to the public
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
C. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the developer. Annually, the municipality may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements
which have been completed and the estimated cost the completion of
the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date
of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the municipality may
require the developer to post additional security in order to assure that
the financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection. If the
developer postpones installation of the final wearing surface of the
street until after acceptance of the public improvements as provided in
the Appendix, CD-1,276 then 110% of the cost of the wearing surface
only shall be posted as security for completion based on a current
estimate of the cost of the wearing surface. The amount of financial
security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of
completion of the required improvements. Said estimate is to be
determined in one of the following ways at the option of the
applicant:277
(1) An estimate submitted by the Township Engineer.
(2) An estimate submitted by the applicant and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed in Pennsylvania, and certified by
such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of the cost. The
Township, upon the advice of the Municipal Engineer may refuse to
accept such estimate, in which case procedures authorized in
§ 509(g) of the Municipalities Planning Code shall be followed.278
276. Editor's Note: CD-1 is an illustration in Appendix A, Construction Details and
Specifications, which is attached to this chapter.

No improvements shall be made or approved by the Council except in
accordance with the following procedure:
D. In cases where development is projected over a period of years, the
Township may authorize submission of final plats by section or stages of
development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to
improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
E. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Council to release
or authorize the release, from time to time, such portions of the
financial security necessary for payment to the contractor(s)
performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing addressed to
the Council, and the Council shall have 45 days from receipt of such
request within which to allow the Township Engineer to certify, in
writing, to Council that such portion of the work upon the
improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved
plat and supplemental plans. Upon such certification, the Council shall
authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an
amount as estimated by the Township Engineer which fairly represents
the value of the improvements completed, or, if the Council fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Council shall be deemed to have
approved the release of funds as requested. In the event that the
improvements have been guaranteed by the posting of an improvement
bond, the developer shall be required to post a bond in the lesser
amount prior to the release of the originally posted performance bond.
The Council may, prior to final release at the time of completion and
certification by the Township Engineer, require retention of 10% of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
F. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility
or municipal authority separate and distinct from the Township,
financial security to assure proper completion and maintenance thereof
shall be posted with said public utility or municipal authority and shall
not be included with the financial security posted with the Township.

prepare the subgrade of the road, he shall notify the Township Manager
and the Township Engineer, in writing.
B. Twenty four hours before the developer or contractor is ready to lay the
slag base of a road, he shall notify the Township Engineer, so that the
Township Engineer shall make periodic inspections during the course of
installation.

A. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording, shall be
subject to pay for and in respect to the transaction or any part thereof, a

rate of 1 1/2%. Pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act of December 31,

the tax levied by Peters Township under the authority of the Local Tax
Enabling Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax up to 1%
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the 1% rate
and such one-half rate shall become effective without any action on the
part of Peters Township. Provided further, however, that Peters
Township and any political subdivision which imposes such tax on the
same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum one-percent rate permitted under the "Local Tax Enabling
Act". However, in addition thereto, pursuant to its authority under
§ C-5.12 of the Home Rule Charter of Peters Township and a
referendum vote conducted during the general municipal election held

one-half-percent tax on those transactions made subject to tax by virtue
of § 391-17A of this article, the entire amount of which shall be payable
solely to Peters Township.
D. Any tax imposed under § 391-17A that is not paid by the date the tax is
due shall bear interest as prescribed for interest on delinquent
municipal claims under the Act of May 16, 1923 (P.L. 207, No. 153) (53
P.S. § 7101 et seq.), as amended, known as the "Municipal Claims and
Tax Liens Act." The interest rate shall be the lesser of the interest rate

§ 391-18. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth, or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall
not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.

imposed upon delinquent commonwealth taxes as provided in § 806 of
the Act of April 9, 1929 (P.L. 343, No. 176) (72 P.S. § 806), as amended,
known as "The Fiscal Code," or the maximum interest rate permitted
under the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act for tax claims.
A. The tax imposed by § 391-17 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation which reconveyance may include property fine
adjustments, provided said reconveyance is made within one year
from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which Peters Township is prohibited from taxing under
the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
district or county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax
claim bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
co-tenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister, and between a grandparent and
grandchild or the spouse of such grandchild, except that a

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a descendent to the descendent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are
contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.

beneficiary of an ordinary trust.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from trustee to
successor trustee.
(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this claim.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.
(13) A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held of
record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the
association has been held by the grantee for more than two years.

purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
(b) The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.
(17) Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons on holding title for a religious organization if such real
estate is not being or has not been used by such transferor for
commercial purposes.
(18) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax exempt status
pursuant to § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 [68A

Value may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural
gas or minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation

§ 391-41. Exemptions and refunds.

all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its

Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps

may annually file an exemption certificate with the Collector with
the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably expects
to receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the
Township of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate is filed. The exemption certificate shall have
attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2
forms from employment within the political subdivision for the year
prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be
exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate
and until otherwise instructed by the political subdivision or except
as required by Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the
tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of
the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies,
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption
certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political
subdivision.

calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political

subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year
or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for
that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an extension for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue
collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The TCC, in consultation with the Collector and DCED, shall
establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax
paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures
shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating
to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds
made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day
the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the
calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption
and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the Township, as well as those employers
situated outside the Township but who engage in business within the
Township, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from
each employee engaged by him or performing for him within the
Township and making a return and payment thereof to the Collector.
Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each
employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary,

wage or commission and whether or not all such services are performed
within the Township.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the Township.

more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be $52 on each person for each calendar year, irrespective
of the number of political subdivisions within which a person may be
employed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of
payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the Township if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of this article and
remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 391-42 CHARTER § 391-43
C:573
§ 391-43. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 391-44. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 391-45. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engaged in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the Township shall be required to comply with this
article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 391-46. Employment in more than one occupation or political
subdivision.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which required the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposed the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

C:574
§ 391-47. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places

of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject

ARTICLE I
Logging and Timber Harvesting
[Adopted 3-26-2012 by Ord. No. 747 (Ch. 25, Part 1, of the 1981
Code of Ordinances)]
§ 402-1. Purpose.
§ 402-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
FELLING  The act of cutting a standing tree so that it falls to the ground.
FORESTRY  The management of forests and timberlands when practiced
in accordance with accepted silvicultural principles, through developing,
cultivating, harvesting, transporting and selling trees for commercial
purposes, which does not involve any land development.
LANDING  A place where logs, pulpwood, or firewood are assembled for
transportation to processing facilities.
LANDOWNER  An individual, partnership, company, firm, association, or
corporation that is in actual control of forestland, whether such control is
based on legal or equitable title, or any other interest entitling the holder
to sell or otherwise dispose of any or all of the timber on such land in
any manner, and any agents thereof acting on their behalf, such as forestry
consultants, who set up and administer timber harvesting.
A. Timber harvesting regulations are intended to:
(1) Preserve environmental and economic benefits associated with
proper forest management; and
(2) Promote proper forest stewardship; and
(3) Avoid unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions on the right to
practice forestry; and
(4) Protect the rights of adjoining property owners; minimize the
potential for adverse environmental impacts associated with any
logging or timber harvesting operation; and
(5) Avoid unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions on the right of
property owners to log or harvest timber (which activity is a
permitted use in all zoning districts).
B. To encourage maintenance and management of forested or wooded
open space and promote the conduct of forestry as a sound and
economically viable use of forested land throughout the Township.
Forestry activities, including timber harvesting, shall be a permitted
use by right in all zoning districts.
§ 402-1 CHARTER § 402-2
C:579
LITTER  Discarded items not naturally occurring on the site, such as tires,
oil cans, equipment parts, and other rubbish.
LOGGING  The act of cutting live trees for cordwood, for timber, for pulp
or for any purpose, excepting therefrom a homeowner cutting on his own
property for his own use; clearing for development of building sites with
approved final plats, site plans or grading plans; or clearing for farming
operations. A "logger" is defined as the person(s) performing the work on
behalf of the owner.
LOP  To cut tops and slash into smaller pieces to allow material to settle
close to the ground.
OPERATOR  An individual, partnership, company, firm, association, or
corporation engaged in timber harvesting, including the agents,
subcontractors, and employees thereof.
PRECOMMERCIAL TIMBER STAND IMPROVEMENT  A forest practice,
such as thinning or pruning, which results in better growth, structure,
species composition, or health for the residual stand but which does not
yield a net income to the landowner, usually because any trees cut are of
poor quality, too small or otherwise of limited marketability or value.
SKIDDING  Dragging trees on the ground from the stump to the landing
by any means.
SLASH  Woody debris left in the woods after logging, including logs,
chunks, bark, branches, uprooted stumps, and broken or uprooted trees or
shrubs.
STAND  Any area of forest vegetation whose site conditions, past history,
and current species composition are sufficiently uniform to be managed as
a unit.
STREAM  Any natural or artificial channel of conveyance for surface
water with an annual or intermittent flow within a defined bed and bank.
TIMBER HARVESTING, TREE HARVESTING or LOGGING  The part of
forestry involving cutting down trees and removing logs from the forest for
the primary purpose of sale or commercial processing into wood products.
TOP  The upper portion of a felled tree that is not merchantable because
of small size, taper, or defect.
WETLANDS  Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water
or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and
that under normal circumstances, do support a prevalence of vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions including swamps,
marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

(2) Logging operations within Peters Township on any parcel of
property over one acre in size shall require a permit. Logging
permits shall only be valid for a period of six months or as
otherwise indicated on the permit. However, since the logging
operation may be adversely affected or delayed by unusual
circumstances of weather or other occurrences, one additional sixmonth
extension, after payment of a renewal fee equal to the initial
permit fee, may be granted by the Township. Any additional
extensions shall require application to the Peters Township
Council.
(3) A logging and timber harvesting permit shall not be required, and
this section shall not apply to:

Guiding Principles And Vision
§ 440-200. Guiding principles.
The Zoning Ordinance represents a key regulatory mechanism for achieving
the land use pattern and quality of development articulated in Plan Peters
2022, the Township's Comprehensive Plan. The Plan expresses guiding
principles to form the basis for future land use and capital investment
decisions based on the commonly held community values revealed during
the planning process. The following principles are rooted in the features
of Peters Township that stakeholders, residents, local leaders, business
owners and other participants, prized the most, and they define elements
of the future community the Township wishes to become. These statements
underpin the Zoning Ordinance and should inform the way in which it is
administered and enforced.
A. Promote unique activity centers. Encourage the development of unique
activity centers that include a mix of uses and activities located close
together, providing people with new options for places to live, work,
shop and participate in civic life. Centers should vary in scale, use and
intensity depending on location and context. Activity centers are
represented by a hierarchy of walkable neighborhoods with
complementary commercial uses, mixed-use activity centers, and an
identifiable town center, all of which reflect the unique character of
Peters Township. The presence of activity centers should further the
economic vitality and sustainability of the Township, while also
promoting social interaction and community building.
B. Emphasize housing choice and diversity. Provide a greater range of
housing choices to enable a diversity of people at all stages of life to
enjoy Peters Township, including young adults, families, empty nesters,
retirees, seniors and people of different income levels. Housing
opportunities should include small homes on small lots, multifamily
housing, and live-work units, in addition to large, single-family homes
prevalent in the area. A more diversified housing strategy will promote
housing choice and a more livable community.
C. Stay forever green. Promote and preserve natural areas of Peters
Township, including ponds, woods, trails, working farms and parks.
Strive to create an interconnected network of green space that
conserves critical natural areas, supports working farms, provides
recreational linkages, protects water quality and quantity and
contributes to the identity and sense of place within the community. If
properties develop, create usable open spaces that contribute to the
overall character and experience of the community.
D. Build Township character and identity. Coordinate building
architecture, site design and streetscape improvements in the planning
area to reinforce a distinct brand or image unique to Peters Township.
The highest priority should be to connect, re-purpose or re-use existing
§ 440-200 CHARTER § 440-200
C:653
§ 440-201. Vision.
The guiding principles are tied together in the vision expressed in Plan
Peters 2022. The vision embodies the desires articulated throughout the
planning process. It is a broad statement of the ideal character of the
community:
"Peters Township will continue to do what it does best  provide an
enviable living environment with great schools, efficient services, proactive
government and significant open spaces - while enhancing its competitive
position in the region as a fiscally and environmentally sustainable
community through increased housing choices for all stages of life,
expanded employment opportunities, vibrant activity nodes, walkable
neighborhoods and improved connectivity."
§ 440-202. How to use this document.
This chapter contains sections that describe various aspects of
requirements that apply to land use within Peters Township. In evaluating a
proposed use for a site:
retail and employment centers that promote economic development
and increase the quantity and quality of public spaces and community
gathering areas throughout the Township.
E. Increase transportation choice and walkability. Provide a safe, reliable
transportation system that balances all modes of transportation,
including walking, biking, transit and cars. Consider land use and
infrastructure together, promoting street connectivity and complete
streets that emphasize the quality and character of both the
thoroughfare and adjoining development. Concentrate on both
destination-based as well as recreational trips, promoting active living
for all ages, with special attention given to the mobility of children and
seniors.
F. Enhance the municipal advantage. Promote a healthy and sustainable
business environment by building a community that is attractive to
employers and their workers. Continue to promote Peters Township and
build a competitive advantage to attract knowledge-based businesses to
the area. Investment and recruitment initiatives should realize triple
bottom-line benefits for Township residents by seeking to improve the
tax base, promote economic vitality for local shops and businesses, and
increase access to employment opportunities in the area.
G. Excel in education and Township service. Continue to advance quality
of life for all residents of Peters Township by maintaining and
expanding education and Township services, while ensuring that
elected officials are good stewards of Township assets. This includes a
strong partnership with the Peters Township School District to support
their programming and academic achievement, while continuing to
earn strong community support.

§ 440-401. District boundaries.
A. If, and whenever, changes are made in boundaries or other matter
included on the Official Zoning Map, such changes in the Map shall be
made within 30 days after each amendment has been approved by the
Council.
B. District boundaries shown on the lines of roads, streams and
transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow their center
lines. The vacation of roads shall not affect the location of such district
boundaries. When the Planning Director cannot definitely determine
the location of a district boundary by such center lines, by the scale of
dimensions stated on the Official Zoning Map or by the fact that it
clearly coincides with a lot line, the Planning Director shall refuse
action, and the Township Zoning Hearing Board, upon appeal, shall
interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the
§ 440-400 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-401
C:718
§ 440-402. General regulations; Composite Land Use Chart.
scale of the Official Zoning Map and the purposes set forth in all
relevant provisions of this chapter.
C. Boundary lines and the Township line. Where a lot, tract or parcel in a
district crosses the Township line, the Planning Commission and/or the
Council shall cooperate with the adjacent municipality in the approval
of any plans involving such a lot, tract or parcel, provided that the
district as established in this chapter shall not be violated.
D. Annexed land. All land annexed to the Township after the effective date
of this chapter shall be automatically classified within the LD Low-
Density Residential District and shall remain so classified until the
Council has adopted a zoning plan for the annexed area. The Planning
Commission shall recommend to the Council appropriate zoning for the
annexed area within 90 days of the effective date of such annexation.
E. Overlay District boundaries. Peters Township is hereby divided into a
series of overlay districts that are listed below. The provisions for the
overlay districts shall supplement the requirements for the underlying
zoning districts contained in this chapter.
(1) Floodplain Management Districts. These districts are established
as those areas subject to the one-hundred-year flood as shown on
the Peters Township Flood-Prone Area Map that is available in the
municipal office. (See Part 11.)
(2) Finleyville Airport Hazard Overlay District. These regulations for
the Finleyville Airport are contained in Article V of this Part 4. The
district boundary is shown on the Zoning District Map.
(3) Other overlay districts. The boundaries for Conservation
Residential (CR) and Mixed Residential (MR) are specified on the
Zoning District Map.
A. No building, structure or land shall be constructed or used for any
purpose or in any manner other than for one or more of the permitted
uses, conditional uses, or uses by special exception or administrative
approval of the zoning district in which such building, structure or land
is located. Except in the case of development requiring the preparation
and approval of a planned land development, not more than one
detached principal building shall be located on a lot.
B. Any land, buildings or premises which involves a group of two or more
buildings, or the division or allocation of land or space between or
among two or more existing or prospective occupants by means of, or
for the purpose of streets, common areas, leaseholds, building groups
or other features is considered a land development and is regulated by
the Peters Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
(See Chapter 385 of the Charter and Code of Peters Township.) in
addition to this chapter.
§ 440-401 CHARTER § 440-402
C:719
C. All land uses and land development layout shall be regulated as per the
specifications within specified districts unless floodplain controls, as
defined by Part 11, and/or the Airport Hazard Overlay (AO) supersede.
D. In addition to the general regulations zoning requirements and
standards defined by Part 5, all Supplemental Regulations shall
conform to all the applicable requirements and provisions defined by
Part 6. All uses by special exception shall conform to all the applicable
requirements and provisions defined in the district regulations (Part 4).

Residential Districts
§ 440-403.1. LD Low-Density Residential District.
A. Intent.
(1) Low-density residential neighborhoods are formed as subdivisions
and consist entirely of single-family detached homes. Buildings are
oriented interior to the site and are typically buffered from
surrounding development by transitional uses, topography, or
vegetative areas. Many neighborhoods borrow open space from
adjacent rural or natural areas, as well as adjacent undeveloped
land.
(2) Blocks are typically large and include one or more culs-de-sac.
Curvilinear streets are suburban in character and promote
automobile travel.
B. Principal uses. The following is a list of principal uses that are
permitted by right, special exception, conditional use or administrative
approval:

A. Intent.
(1) This district promotes the protection and conservation of open
space through flexible requirements that are based on function and
are responsive to the unique character of the undeveloped wooded
parcels in Peters Township. The district encourages innovative and
livable housing environments by offering development options
designed to accommodate new growth while preserving sensitive
environmental features.
(2) Much of the development in the WP Woodland Protection
Residential District has already been developed under the criteria
for the R-1B Zoning classification. The new standards and criteria
presented herein apply to those structures that are in new WP
(R-1B) developments, or in existing structures that are proposing
significant change as determined on a case-by-case basis by the
Planning Director and/or the Planning Commission.

such as swimming pools, sport courts, play structures, etc. No
outdoor storage shall occur behind or beside the shed within
reduced setback areas.
D. Other requirements.
(1) This district encourages flexibility in designing new residential
subdivisions by allowing three development form options:
(a) Open space design option; use by right.
(b) Half-acre design option; use by right.
(c) Two-acre design option; use by right.
(2) All options are intended to minimize impacts on environmental
resources (sensitive lands, such as wetlands, steep slopes,
floodplains) and disturbance of natural features (such as mature
woodlands, hedgerows, critical wildlife habitats).
(3) The following design objectives shall be considered in the review of
any proposed subdivision development within the WP Woodland
Protection Residential Zoning District:
(a) To provide a more environmentally sensitive residential
environment by preserving the natural character of stands of
trees, ponds, streams, steep slopes, and similar natural
features;
(b) To preserve the rural landscape and protect environmentally
sensitive lands from the disruptive effects of traditional
subdivision developments;
(c) To allow a more flexible and environmentally sensitive
residential layout and street design;
§ 440-403.2 CHARTER § 440-403.2
C:739
(d) To encourage a less sprawling form of residential subdivision
design;
(e) To design, construct and maintain all subdivisions so that
existing stands of healthy trees and native vegetation of the
site are preserved to the maximum extent feasible and are
protected by adequate means during construction; and
(f) To blend the residential living units into the natural setting of
the landscape for the enhancement of property values.
E. Open space design development.
(1) The total number of dwelling units permitted on a parcel when the
open space design option is chosen shall be determined by
submittal of a half-acre subdivision (as provided for in the
underlying zoning district) sketch plan identifying the lots and
buildable lands. After the Planning Commission reviews the halfacre
subdivision plan, the maximum number of lots for the
development will be determined. In no case shall the maximum
residential density of 1.2 lots per acre specified for the underlying
zoning district be increased.
(2) Open space standards:
(a) Dwelling units shall be grouped so that open space within a
development is at least 40% of the total acreage of the tract.
(b) Areas not considered open space. Required open space shall
not include areas devoted to public or private streets or rightsof-
way, private yards, stormwater management facilities,
erosion and sedimentation control facilities, storm and sanitary
sewer easements or any utility easement. If plans require such
facilities in open space areas, they will not be counted as part
of the required open space area. All existing areas in surface
water bodies shall not be considered required open space.
(c) Calculating open space. Except as noted above, any
undeveloped land area within the boundaries of the parcel may
be included as required open space.
(d) Common open space shall be directly accessible to the largest
practicable number of lots within an open space development.
To achieve this, one side of each dwelling unit or lot to the
maximum extent practicable shall abut common open space to
provide direct views and access. Safe and convenient
pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not adjoining
the open space shall be provided.
(e) The shape of the open space areas to the maximum practicable
shall be reasonably contiguous, coherently configured, and
abut existing or potential open space on adjacent properties.
§ 440-403.2 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-403.2
C:740
(f) Ownership and maintenance of open space areas shall be as
specified in § 440-406.1, Open space standards and
management, under the Conservation Residential Overlay
District. (See § 440-406.1.)
F. Half-acre design development. A tract may be developed utilizing a halfacre
subdivision design rather than the open space design option,
provided that:
(1) The half-acre development will preserve the rural landscape and
protect environmentally sensitive lands. The basic premise of this
approach is that lot configuration and street layout shall be
determined by an understanding and appreciation of the existing
natural features present on the site.
(2) House sites and streets to the maximum extent practicable shall be
carefully laid out to avoid specific areas which are environmentally
sensitive, particularly scenic, or which possess significant
attributes (wildlife habitats, hedgerows, mature tree stands,
wetlands, etc.). The applicant shall be required to protect such
features from further development or encroachment with
appropriate covenants running with the land or as permanently
dedicated open space.
(3) The applicant's proposed design achieves the intent of the
Woodland Protection District by demonstrating how the design
objectives set forth in this subsection are being accomplished.
(4) Open space shall be provided in accordance with § 385-40C of the
Subdivision and Land Development Regulations, Open space land,
R-1 single-family developments.
G. Two-acre (estate lot) design development. A tract may be developed
utilizing a two-acre subdivision design option, provided that:
(1) The estate lot development will preserve the rural landscape and
protect environmentally sensitive lands. The basic premise of this
approach is that the lot configuration and street layout shall be
determined by an understanding and appreciation of the existing
natural features present on the site.
(2) House sites and streets to the maximum extent practicable shall be
carefully laid out to avoid specific areas which are environmentally
sensitive, particularly scenic, or which possess significant
attributes (wildlife habitats, hedgerows, mature tree stands,
wetlands, etc.). The applicant shall be required to protect such
features from further development or encroachment with
appropriate covenants running with the land or as permanently
dedicated open space.
§ 440-403.2 CHARTER § 440-403.2
C:741
§ 440-403.3. CL Single-Family Cluster District.
(3) The applicant's proposed design achieves the intent of the
Woodland Protection Zoning District by demonstrating how the
design objectives are being accomplished.
A. Intent.
(1) The intent of this district is to provide zoning regulations for
existing residential neighborhoods that developed under singlefamily
cluster lot development regulations.
(2) Much of the development in the CL Single-Family Cluster
Residential District has already been developed under the criteria
for the R-1C zoning classification. The new standards and criteria
presented herein apply to those structures that are in new CL
(R-1C) developments or in existing structures that are proposing
significant change, as determined on a case-by-case basis by the
Planning Director and/or the Planning Commission.

A. Intent. The intent of this district is to provide zoning regulations in the
Hackett area of Peters Township to promote, encourage, and preserve
the unique character of the area.
(1) Create a residential village character that complements existing
village development.
(2) Accommodate a variety of housing types and discourage one
housing type from dominating the streetscape.
(3) Promote pedestrian orientation of streets and buildings.
(4) Develop streets and homes that promote social interaction as well
as privacy.
(5) Alleviate the perceived impact of higher-density development, such
as townhouses, by requiring them to be of a pedestrian scale, bulk,
and orientation.
(6) Give priority to pedestrian movement and access to buildings, open
spaces, and streets and discourage design that gives priority to
vehicular convenience only.
(7) Create a street circulation system that provides safe and
convenient access but discourages fast or heavy traffic that is
incompatible with a residential neighborhood.
(8) Use scale, building orientation, and landscaping to establish
community identity.
(9) Use open and recreational spaces as a community focal point.
(10) Provide recreational opportunities.
§ 440-403.5 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-403.6
C:750
(11) Ensure that new development is compatible with the existing
neighborhood.

Example of Potential VR Development
§ 440-403.6 CHARTER § 440-403.6
C:753
(1) The VR Village Residential District is a slight name change and
clarification of the former R-3 Zoning District (the Village
Residential area of Hackett). It is designed to preserve the existing
village character of this area. A few key elements of this zoning
district are listed below:
(a) Predominately residential uses, but other compatible uses are
permitted.
(b) New development will be predominately single-family
detached and attached infill that complements the character of
the existing Hackett neighborhood.
(c) Linkages to the nearby VM Village Mixed Use Neighborhood
and the VC Village Commercial area.
(d) Create a mixed residential village character that complements
existing village development.
(e) Discourage one housing type from dominating the streetscape.
(f) Develop streets and homes that promote social interaction as
well as privacy.
(g) Give priority to pedestrian movement and access to buildings,
open spaces, and streets and discourage design that gives
priority to vehicular convenience only.
(h) Further establish a street circulation system that provides safe
and convenient access but discourages fast or heavy traffic
that is incompatible with a residential neighborhood.
§ 440-403.6 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-403.6
C:754
(i) Use the existing scale, building orientation, and landscaping to
reinforce community identity.
(j) Provide recreational opportunities.
(k) Ensure that new development is compatible with existing
neighborhoods.
(2) Building design standards.
(a) All dwelling units must have at least one primary entrance in
the front facade.
(b) All residential buildings shall have pitched roofs (4/12)
covering at least 80% of the building.
E. Access and circulation.
(1) Local residential street cross section.

Nonresidential Districts
§ 440-404.1. TC McMurray Town Center District.
A. Intent. This district is intended to:
(1) Provide a defined community-scale residential, commercial,
cultural, and entertainment district and central gathering place for
Peters Township residents.
(2) Facilitate traffic through the development of streetscape amenities,
such as sidewalks, pathways, street edge landscaping features,
pedestrian-scale lighting and screened parking areas.
(3) Develop centralized civic spaces that integrate the district's
residential and nonresidential uses, and to encourage the
continued development of a central activity focal point by further
defining the existing mixed use area.
(4) Provide lively, human-scaled activity areas and gathering places for
Peters Township residents through encouraging a mix of uses.

anticipated future needs for industrial activity with due
allowance for the needs for a range in choice of sites.
(b) Protect industry against congestion by limiting the bulk of
buildings in relation to the land around them and to one
another, and by providing sufficient off-street parking and
loading facilities for such developments.
(c) Promote the most desirable use of land and direction of
building development in accord with a well-considered plan, to
promote stable industry, to strengthen the economic base, to
protect the character of particular industrial areas and their
peculiar suitability to uses, to conserve the value of land and
buildings, and to protect local tax revenues.
(d) Encourage industrial development that is free from offensive
noise, vibration, smoke, odor, glare, hazards of fire or other
objectionable effects.
(2) Much of the development in the IN Industrial District has already
been developed under the criteria for the LI Light Industrial Zoning
classification. The new standards and criteria presented herein
apply to those structures that are in new IN Industrial (LI)
developments or in existing structures that are proposing
significant change, as determined on a case-by-case basis by the
Planning Director and/or the Planning Commission.

D. Other requirements. Industrial development in Peters Township shall
provide opportunities in light industrial, laboratory, warehouse and
similar activities to concentrate employment on normal workdays. It is
the intention that each industrial area be established as a campus
which generally supports manufacturing and production uses as a
cohesive development integrating green technology to the extent
possible.
(1) These industrial areas shall be found in close proximity to major
transportation corridors and are generally buffered from
surrounding development by transitional uses or landscaped areas
that shield the view from structures, loading docks, or outdoor
storage from adjacent properties.
(2) Clusters of uses that support or serve one another are encouraged
to locate in the same industrial center.
(3) To minimize impacts on neighbors, the industrial district(s) shall be
landscaped and integrate natural features to the extent possible.
(4) A consistent streetscape shall be a part of the industrial district(s).
(5) Local roadways, parking and loading areas that promote
connectivity are encouraged.
(6) Service areas and green spaces should be common and integrated
into campus design.
A. Intent.
§ 440-404.3 CHARTER § 440-404.4
C:809
(1) General commercial areas serve the daily needs of surrounding
residential neighborhoods. They typically locate near high-volume
roads and key intersections, and are designed to be accessible
primarily by automobile.
(2) Common types of suburban strip centers in Peters Township
include multitenant strip centers, big box stores, and standalone
businesses. Much of the development in the GC General
Commercial District has already been developed under the criteria
for the C-2 zoning classification. The new standards and criteria
presented herein apply to those structures that are in new GC (C-2)
developments or in existing structures that are proposing
significant change, as determined on a case-by-case basis by the
Planning Director and/or the Planning Commission. New, or
significantly altered development within the GC General
Commercial Zoning District shall place parking to the rear, center
or side (away from arterial, connector or collector roads, or
primary internal/local access streets).

Mixed Use Districts
§ 440-405.1. MA Mixed-Use Activity Center District.
A. Intent.
(1) This district is intended to provide for an appropriate mix of
compatible residential, commercial and office space opportunities.
This district is also designed to provide services for surrounding
residential neighborhoods.
(2) Mixed-use activity centers serve broader economic, entertainment,
and community activities. Uses and buildings are located on small
blocks with streets designed to encourage pedestrian activities.
Buildings typically stand two to four stories in height with
residential units or offices above storefronts. Parking is satisfied
using structured parking, and shared rear-lot parking strategies. A
large-scale mixed-use center may be surrounded by one or more
neighborhoods that encourage active living, with a comprehensive
and interconnected network of walkable streets.
(3) The Mixed-Use Activity Center is subdivided as:
(a) MA.1: Mixed-Use Activity Center located in the general area of
Route 19 and Waterdam Road. This district allows for a
diversity of uses and building types up to four stories in height.
(b) MA.2: Mixed-Use Activity Center located in four locations
within the Township. These smaller districts provide for a
diversity of uses and building types up to two stories in height.

D. Generalized standards within the MA Mixed-Use Activity Center. The
Mixed-Use Activity Center (MA) is a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented
district in which consistent, but different building configurations exist.
To help maintain a Main Street character and encourage pedestrian
friendly environments, nonresidential buildings shall be generally
placed adjacent to the sidewalk in the Mixed-Use Activity Center (MA).
Where there are multiple adjacent buildings/units, the facade of each
building should be unique and may be articulated within a range of

ARTICLE V
Overlay Districts
§ 440-406.1. CR Conservation Residential Overlay District.
A. District intent.
(1) The Conservation Residential Overlay District (CR) supports the
sustainable development goals in the Plan Peters 2022
Comprehensive Plan by protecting natural resources and providing
incentives for the creation of open spaces that add value to the
community. By virtue of their sufficient size, potential recreation
utility, provision of visual relief, preservation of sensitive natural
features, proximity to dwellings and/or contribution to a connected
system of open space, these spaces enhance the overall quality of
life of the community and conserve important natural amenities.
Conservation subdivision design preserves open space while
maintaining the density of residential units across the overall site
area.
(2) This overlay district is designated as a TND Overlay District [the
TND Traditional Neighborhood Development District, in
accordance with the MPC (Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code Article VII-A)]. As such the criteria and standards set forth
herein shall provide development alternatives, where stated, to the
underlying zoning districts.
(3) The general intent and criteria for establishing residential zoning
districts in Peters Township include:
(a) Providing sufficient, appropriately located space for residential
development which provides a range of housing types and
densities in order to meet the housing needs of the Township's
present and expected future population.
(b) Establishing zoning district boundaries that identify the areas
of Peters Township that best meet the criteria established
below.
[1] Assure light, air and privacy by controlling the spacing and
height of buildings and other structures.
[2] Protect residential areas against hazards of fire, offensive
noise, vibration, smoke, odors, glare or other objectionable
influences.
[3] Prevent congestion, as far as possible, by regulating the
density of population, the bulk of buildings, and by
providing for sufficient off-street parking.
[4] Protect residential neighborhoods from traffic congestion.
§ 440-406.1 CHARTER § 440-406.1
C:863
[5] Make possible provisions for public and private
educational, recreational, health and similar facilities
which perform most effectively in a residential
environment, which serve the needs of nearby residents
and which do not create objectionable influences.
[6] Promote the most desirable use of land and direction of
building development in accordance with well-considered
plans that protect the character of the Township's
residential districts.
[7] Promote stable residential development that conserves the
value of land and buildings while contributing to the
Township's tax base.
[8] Encourage residential development practices that respect
the Township's traditional agricultural character and
enterprises.
[9] Promote the preservation of the Township's agricultural
land.
[10] Maintain the character of Peters Township as established
in the Plan Peters 2022 Comprehensive Plan.
[11] Not exceed existing capacities of the existing and
proposed public infrastructure.
(4) As stated in Plan Peters 2022, the Conservation Residential Overlay
District (CR) is intended to:
(a) Allow development that permanently protects rural character,
open space, agricultural lands, woodlands, wetlands, critical
views and other natural features in the Township.
(b) Allow flexibility in the placement and type of dwelling units
within the subdivision.
(c) Reduce the number of new roads and allow flexibility in road
specifications for roads serving residences in the Conservation
Residential Overlay District (CR).
(d) Reduce the amount of impervious surfaces in subdivisions,
including driveways.
(e) Encourage more efficient land development patterns that
reduce the cost of infrastructure and maintenance.
(f) Ensure that development in the Conservation Residential
Overlay District (CR) results in the creation of usable open
space that contributes to the overall character and experience
of the community.
§ 440-406.1 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-406.1
C:864
(g) Protect the local landscape and environmentally sensitive
lands from the disruptive effects of conventional subdivision
design.
(h) Establish that designated open space be protected from future
subdivision and more intense development through deed
restrictions.
(i) Encourage street connectivity with curvilinear streets of
varying block lengths.
B. Criteria for consideration.

(e) Local streets may be included as part of the buffer, if
vegetative screening utilized.
(3) Residential units or lots shall be oriented with direct access to
common open space, to the maximum extent possible. To that end,
each dwelling unit or lot shall have at least one side abut open
space, to the maximum extent possible, to provide direct views and
access. Common open space across a street shall qualify for this
requirement.
(4) A conservation development may contain one or more groupings of
dwelling units and/or lots.
(5) Dwelling unit lots and integrated resources (shared community
facilities) shall be accessed only from interior (local) streets.
(6) Green courts are also encouraged as a means of creating shared
common space and a stronger sense of place.
(7) Topography, tree and ground cover and natural drainageways shall
be treated as fixed determinants of road and lot configuration. Any
grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of
the neighboring developed areas and the Peters Township Grading
Ordinances (Chapter 229, Peters Township Code of Ordinances).
(8) Accessory structures and dwellings in this overlay district shall
meet the following minimum structural design standards:

H. Conservation residential inventory and site design.
(1) It shall be required that the developer prepare a conservation
residential inventory and site design. The following outlines the
procedures for conducting a conservation-based design and layout
for subdivision plans in the CR Conservation Residential Overlay
District. The conservation design layout procedure is designed to
assist the applicant, the Peters Township Planning Commission,
Peters Township Council, and the public in preparing and analyzing
the materials for subdivision applications within the CR:
Conservation Residential Overlay District.
§ 440-406.1 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-406.1

I. Open space standards and management.
(1) An amount of land equivalent to a minimum of 25% to 40% of gross
tract acreage [see Density/Open Space for Conservation
Subdivision Design], including developable and undevelopable land
[see Designated Open Space: Constrained and Excluded Land],
shall be open space designated for natural habitat, active or
passive recreation and/or conservation or preservation, including
conservation for agricultural or forestry uses.
§ 440-406.1 CHARTER § 440-406.1
C:875
(2) Any proposed open space that is to be utilized as designated open
space, for purposes of meeting the open space requirements of the
Conservation Residential Overlay District (CR), unless conveyed to
the Township, shall be deeded to an approved homeowners'
association/property owners' association (HOA/POA), land trust or
conservation organization and accompanied by a maintenance plan
reviewed and approved in writing as determined by Peters
Township.
(3) All open space that is owned by Peters Township, by transfer of
title, deed or easement, shall be considered public and accessible
to all residents of Peters Township.
(4) Open space standards:
(a) Residential units or lots shall be oriented with direct access to
common open space to the maximum extent possible. To that
end, each dwelling unit or lot shall have at least one side abut
open space (unobstructed) to the maximum extent possible, to
provide direct views and access. Common open space across a
street shall qualify for this requirement.
(b) Open space shall be set aside, with minimal placement of
temporary/staging of construction associated structures.
Permanent construction of structures, paved surfaces or
ground disturbance is not allowed in primary open space,
unless prior approval is granted as part of the preliminary
(master) plan.
(c) The subdivision shall provide links to open space and/or
recreation on abutting parcels, including pedestrian/bike
trails, to create linked pathways/corridors in the Township.
Open space shall be configured so that it is adjacent to or
directly across the street from as many of the subdivision's lots
as possible.
(d) Open space in conservation subdivisions shall be physically
linked, whenever possible, to the developing interconnected
network of green space described in Plan Peters 2022, or the
Peters Township Parks and Recreation Comprehensive Plan.
Designated public trail systems which abut a conservation
subdivision shall be connected to the subdivision.
(5) Uses not considered open space:
(a) Sewage treatment facilities.
(b) Stormwater detention basins (detention facilities can be
considered open space).
(6) All lands and improvements in designated open space shall be
established, managed and maintained. If no agency agrees to
§ 440-406.1 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-406.1
C:876
accept responsibility for the open space, responsibility falls to the
owner. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Peters Township Council,
the cost and responsibility of maintaining common space shall
be borne by the property owner, community or recognized
homeowners' association/property owners' association (HOA/POA),
or approved land trust or conservation organization.
(7) Dedication of land or easements to Peters Township. Peters
Township may, but shall not be required to, accept dedication of
land or easements in the form of fee simple ownership for public
use of any portion of the common open space. In the case of
easement dedication, the facility remains in the ownership of the
community or homeowners' association or private conservation
organization, while Peters Township holds the easements. In
addition, the following regulations shall apply:
(a) There shall be no cost of acquisition to the Township (fee
simple dedication).
(b) Any such easements for public use shall be accessible to all
residents of the Township.
(c) A satisfactory maintenance agreement, plus maintenance
escrow, shall be reached between the owner and the Township.
(8) Dedication of land or easements to a private and approved land
trust or conservation organization. With permission from the
Township, an owner may transfer either fee simple title of or
easements on the common open space land to an approved, private
nonprofit land trust or conservation organization, provided that:
(a) The conservation organization is acceptable to the Township
and is a bona fide organization intended to exist indefinitely.
(b) The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for a proper
reverter or retransfer in the event that the organization
becomes unwilling or unable to continue carrying out its
functions.
(c) The common open space is permanently restricted from future
development through a conservation easement, and the
Township is given the authority to enforce these restrictions.
(d) A maintenance agreement acceptable to the Township is
established between the owner and the organization.
(9) Dedication of land or easements to a community and/or
homeowners' association/property owners' association (HOA/POA).
Common open space and recreational facilities may be held in
common ownership for the use of all residents of the subdivision or
land development and shall thereby be controlled and maintained
by a community association, or homeowners'/property owners'
§ 440-406.1 CHARTER § 440-406.1
C:877
association. Association documents shall be in compliance with
the Pennsylvania Uniform Planned Community Act318 or the
Pennsylvania Uniform Condominium Act,319 and reviewed and
approved by the Peters Township Solicitor, as the case may be. The
association documents shall include, but not be limited to:
(a) A description of the common space to be owned by the
association that shall include a plan of the proposal
highlighting the precise location of all aspects of common
space land.
(b) Statements setting forth the powers, duties and
responsibilities of the association, including services to be
provided.
(c) A declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions giving
perpetual easements to the lands and facilities owned by the
association. The declaration shall be a legal document
providing for automatic membership for all owners in the
subdivision or land development and shall describe the
mechanism by which owners participate in the association,
including voting, elections and meetings. The declaration shall
give power to the association to own and maintain common
space and to make and enforce rules.
(d) Requirements for all owners to provide a pro rata share of the
cost of the operations of the association.
[1] A process of collection and enforcement to obtain funds
from owners who fail to comply;
[2] A process for transition of control of the association from
the developer to unit owners;
[3] Statements describing how the common open space will be
insured, including limit of liability; and
[4] Provisions for the dissolution of the association and its
assets.
J. Access and circulation standards.
(1) Measurable criteria apply:
(a) New public or private land development projects shall
demonstrate the continued development of a well-connected
network of streets and access choices for all travel modes.
(b) No local street, alley or special circulating feature shall have a
grade greater than 12%.
318. Editor's Note: See 68 Pa. C.S.A. § 5101 et seq.
319. Editor's Note: See 68 Pa. C.S.A. § 3101 et seq.
§ 440-406.1 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-406.1
C:878
(c) Intervals between creek, or other waterbody crossings shall be
more than 600 feet to minimize impact on the waterway or
stream bank, and provide for maximum street surface stability
as specified by the Peters Township Engineer.
(d) Curb cuts, direct connections between driveways and local
streets, and other impediments to traffic flow shall be kept to a
minimum.
(2) Traffic calming shall be employed following Traffic Calming
Standards TC-01 through TC-09 in the Peters Township Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance (SALDO), Appendix A. In
addition, street trees and on-street parking may be considered
traffic calming by the Peters Township Planning Commission and
Council.
(3) Local residential streets shall have the following characteristics or
meet the following standards:
(a) Utilities shall be subsurface. They may be placed under the
front yard, sidewalk or planting strip.
[1] The tree line may be placed within the planting strip or
front yard so as not to interfere with underground utility
placement. If trees are planted in the planting strip, the
planting strip shall be at least five feet between curb and
sidewalk.
[2] Tree line shall be consistent within the development.
Exceptions may be allowed with permission of the Peters
Township Planning Commission or its designated
representative(s).
[3] Planting strips may be utilized as part of the on-site
stormwater management system.
[4] Street cross sections may be mixed within the
development.
(b) Street cross sections.
[1] Selection of the appropriate cross section depends
primarily on the likely demand for on-street parking and
the density of the street network. The general intent is to
keep the curb-to-curb dimensions of local residential
streets as narrow as possible, while providing adequate
width for emergency vehicles or for other vehicles to safely
get around parked cars.
[2] In general, the more on-site parking provided, via longer
driveways, rear or side loading garages, larger lots, shared
parking, etc., the narrower the allowed cross-section. The
§ 440-406.1 CHARTER § 440-406.1
C:879
street cartway shall include a one-foot curb (asphalt or
concrete).
[3] The narrow cross section is to be used only when it is likely
that there will be only temporary, infrequent on-street
parking and the street network is well-connected. The
narrow cross section may be used if/when:
[a] There is sufficient on-site parking to allow for two
vehicles per unit.
[b] There is street access redundancy (more than one way
for emergency vehicle access).
[c] Auxiliary/visitor parking may be provided in off-street
parking bays located within a radius of 300 feet of
nearby residential units (one parking space per five
residential units).
[d] Overnight parking in the parking bays may be
allowed.
[4] The medium cross section applies where a limited demand
for on-street parking is likely. This cross section includes a
travel lane in each direction and parking on one side of the
street. Parking on alternating sides of the street (with a
minimum of five parking spaces in each group) is allowed.
The medium cross section may be used if/when:
[a] On-street parking is limited to designated parking
areas (one side of the street only) defined by bumpouts
that support mid-block pedestrian crossings.
[b] Sufficient on-site parking is provided for. Two vehicles
per unit is recommended.
[c] There is street access redundancy (more than one way
for emergency vehicle access).
[d] Auxiliary/visitor parking may be provided in off-street
parking bays located within 300 feet of nearby
driveways.
[e] Overnight parking in the parking bays may be
allowed.
[5] The wide cross section applies where a high demand for
on-street parking is likely. This cross section includes a
travel lane in each direction and parking on both sides of
the street. This width will also allow emergency vehicle
staging anywhere along the block. The wide cross section
shall be used if/when:
§ 440-406.1 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-406.1
C:880
[a] On-street parking is permitted on both sides of the
street, but may be limited to designated parking areas
defined by bump-outs that support mid-block
pedestrian crossings.
[b] Sufficient on-site parking is provided for. Two vehicles
per unit is recommended.
[c] There is more than one connection to the street (for
redundant emergency access routes).
[d] Auxiliary/visitor parking may be provided in off-street
parking bays located within 300 feet of nearby
driveways.
[e] Overnight parking in the parking bays may be
allowed.

(1) The MR Mixed Residential Overlay District allows for provision of a
variety of housing types and residential densities organized in a
cohesive, well-connected community. The overlay district is
designed to respect the character of existing neighborhoods while
providing a mix of housing types to accommodate a wide range of
household types and people in different stages of life.
(2) As stated in Plan Peters 2022, the MR Mixed Residential Overlay
District is intended to:
(a) Create a natural transition between lower-intensity singlefamily
neighborhoods and higher-intensity commercial or
mixed-use areas.
§ 440-406.1 CHARTER § 440-406.2
C:893
(b) Promote a variety of housing types and discourage any single
housing type from dominating the streetscape.
(c) Use scale, building orientation and landscaping to reinforce
community identity.
(d) Develop places that promote social interaction as well as
privacy.
(e) Alleviate the perceived impact of relatively high-density
developments, such as multifamily and other attached
dwellings, by requiring them to be of a pedestrian scale, bulk
and orientation.
(f) Prioritize pedestrian and bicycle connections movement and
access to buildings, open spaces and streets.
(g) Promote a street circulation system that provides safe and
convenient access, but discourages fast or heavy traffic.
(h) Establish open and recreational spaces as a neighborhood
focal point.
(i) Encourage green technologies in site development and
building design and zero net discharge technologies.
B. Criteria for consideration.
(1) Approval or denial of a MR Mixed Residential Overlay District
development shall be based on the extent to which the site/
preliminary (master) plan meets the following general and specific
criteria, and others contained within this chapter.
(2) This code will include both design and development standards
(which shall be met) and guidelines (which are encouraged, but not
required). The development shall provide for a variety of housing
types and residential densities organized in a cohesive, wellconnected
community.
(a) All developments shall have a common open space focal point.
(b) All streets, sidewalks, greenways and trails within the
development/subdivision shall establish intra- and
interneighborhood connections to the maximum extent
feasible. Local streets shall have a connectivity index of >1.4
(as determined by the Connectivity Index).
(c) All designated open spaces, internal streets, entrances/
gateways, trails, sidewalks, natural drainage systems, and
interneighborhood connections shall be clearly identified on
the site/preliminary (master) plan.

I. Access and circulation standards.
(1) Measurable criteria apply. New public or private land development
projects shall demonstrate the continued development of a wellconnected
network of streets and access choices for all travel
modes.
(a) No local street, alley or special circulating feature shall have a
grade greater than 12% [§ 385-37, Peters Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (SALDO)].
(b) Intervals between creek or other waterbody crossings shall be
more than 600 feet to minimize impact on the waterway or
stream bank, and provide for maximum street surface stability
as specified by the Peters Township Engineer.
(c) Curb cuts, direct connections between driveways and local
streets, and other impediments to traffic flow shall be kept to a
minimum. Determination shall be in accordance with
§ 385-37G of the Peters Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance (SALDO).
(2) Traffic calming shall be employed following Traffic Calming
Standards TC-01 through TC-09 in the Peters Township Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance (SALDO), Appendix A.
(3) Local residential streets shall have the following characteristics or
meet the following standards:
(a) Utilities shall be subsurface. They may be placed under the
front yard, sidewalk or planting strip.
[1] The tree line may be placed within the planting strip or
front yard so as not to interfere with underground utility
placement.
§ 440-406.2 CHARTER § 440-406.2
C:905
[2] Tree line shall be consistent within the development.
Exceptions may be allowed with permission of the Peters
Township Planning Commission or its designated
representative(s).
[3] Planting strips may be utilized as part of the on-site
stormwater management system.
[4] Street cross sections may be mixed within the
development.
(b) Street cross sections.
[1] Selection of the appropriate cross section depends
primarily on the likely demand for on-street parking and
the density of the street network. The general intent is to
keep the curb-to-curb dimensions of local residential
streets as narrow as possible, while providing adequate
width for emergency vehicles or for other vehicles to safely
get around parked cars.
[2] In general, the more on-site parking provided, via longer
driveways, rear or side loading garages, larger lots, shared
parking, etc., the narrower the allowed cross section.
[3] The narrow cross section is to be used only when it is likely
that there will be only temporary, infrequent on-street
parking and the street network is well-connected. The
narrow cross section may be used if/when:
[a] There is sufficient on-site parking to allow for two
vehicles per unit.
[b] There is more than one connection to the street (for
redundant emergency access routes).
[c] Auxiliary/visitor parking may be provided in off-street
parking bays located within a radius of 300 feet of
nearby residential units (one parking space per five
residential units).
[d] Overnight parking in the parking bays may be
allowed.
[4] The medium cross section is used when it is likely that onstreet
parking will occur on alternating sides of the street
with some frequency. The medium cross section may be
used if/when:
[a] The medium cross section applies where a limited
demand for on-street parking is likely. This cross
section includes a travel lane in each direction and
parking on one side of the street. Parking on
§ 440-406.2 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-406.2
C:906
alternating sides of the street (with a minimum of five
parking spaces in each group) is allowed.
[b] On-street parking is limited to designated parking
areas (one side of the street only) defined by bumpouts
that support mid-block pedestrian crossings.
[c] Sufficient on-site parking is provided for. Two vehicles
per unit is recommended.
[d] There is more than one connection to the street (for
redundant emergency access routes).
[e] Auxiliary/visitor parking may be provided in off-street
parking bays located within 300 feet of nearby
driveways.
[f] Overnight parking in the parking bays may be
allowed.
[5] The wide cross section applies where a high demand for
on-street parking is likely. This cross section includes a
travel lane in each direction and parking on both sides of
the street. This width will also allow emergency vehicle
staging anywhere along the block. The wide cross section
shall be used if/when:
[a] On-street parking is permitted on both sides of the
street, but may be limited to designated parking areas
defined by bump-outs that support mid-block
pedestrian crossings.
[b] Sufficient on-site parking is provided for. Two vehicles
per unit is recommended.
[c] There is more than one connection to the street (for
redundant emergency access routes).
[d] Auxiliary/visitor parking may be provided in off-street
parking bays located within 300 feet of nearby
driveways.
[e] Overnight parking in the parking bays may be
allowed.

B. Driveways in nonresidential districts.
(1) Interior circulation and traffic control. Curb cuts in the
nonresidential and industrial districts shall not exceed 25 feet in
width, exclusive of the curb return radius of 25 feet. Safety
considerations in the review process will include limits on the
number of curb cuts, one-way access requirements, possibilities for
the sharing of curb cuts, and PADOT review where required.
(a) Driveways that provide parking spaces should be so designed
as to discourage through traffic. If parking spaces are
indicated by lines with angles other than 90°, then traffic lanes
may be restricted to one-way, permitting head-in or diagonal
parking. Parking and aisle width requirements are in
§ 440-508.
(b) Driveways for areas provided for loading and unloading of
delivery trucks and other vehicles, and for the servicing of
shops by refuse collection, fuel, deliveries, and other service
vehicles, shall be separate from driveway used by the general
public for access to parking areas if required by the
§ 440-503 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-503
C:926
Commission or the Township Council. Loading requirements
are in § 440-507L.
(2) Design.
(a) All driveways shall be paved. Design of bituminous surfaces
shall be a minimum of six inches of PENNDOT 2A aggregate
base with three inches of ID-2 bituminous binder and 1 1/2
inches of ID-2 bituminous wearing course. Concrete driveways
should be constructed with a minimum of four inches of
AASHTO No. 57 aggregate and five inches of Class A concrete,
reinforced with six-inch by six-inch welded wire fabric.
Concrete driveways abutting Township roads should have an
expansion joint constructed 24 inches behind the curb. This
requirement will save the Township restoration costs during
future maintenance projects by not having to replace the full
concrete slabs.
(b) Design of driveways shall include provisions for positive
subsurface and subbase drainage under and at the outside
edges of the paving. In major cut or potentially wet areas,
underdrains are to be installed under edges of the driveway
and connected to the storm drainage system.
(c) Curbs shall be installed on sides of driveways as requested by
the Township Engineer to contain vehicular traffic, protect
pedestrians, control stormwater, and reduce maintenance of
adjacent seeded or planted areas.
(d) Where no curbs are to be installed, paved scupper ditches of
sufficient depth to intercept surface water and maintain a dry
subgrade for the driveway paving shall be installed.
(e) Center-line markings on driveways shall be required to guide
and control traffic flow.
(f) Traffic direction and control signs shall be provided and "no
parking" and speed limits posted where required by the
Township.
(3) Frontage on private rights-of-way. Development of properties that
front on or contain a private right-of-way shall be governed by the
following criteria and standards.
(a) No nonresidential lot shall be developed unless the private
right-of-way is improved to nonresidential driveway standards
(paving, width, etc.) all the way to a public right-of-way.
(b) All properties fronting on a private right-of-way shall provide
proof that they have the right to use said right-of-way all the
way to a public street.
§ 440-503 CHARTER § 440-503
C:927
(c) Any lot containing a private right-of-way shall improve it as
required in Subsection B(3)(a) of this section for the full depth
or width of the lot being developed.
(4) Service streets. Service streets (e.g., to loading areas) should be of
adequate width to handle the type of traffic anticipated; and should
meet the driveway regulations in this chapter as a minimum; be
designed according to good engineering practices; and be
approved by the Township Planning Commission.
C. A maximum of two entrance driveways shall be constructed per lot,
unless otherwise specified in this chapter.
D. A landowner and/or developer shall be permitted to construct a
pedestrian drop-off and/or vehicular access driveway within a lot's front
yard setback requirements.
E. Driveways for new land development shall be aligned at 90° with an
existing public street right-of-way unless otherwise approved by the
Township Planning Commission.
F. Driveways may extend from the right-of-way of the street to the cartway
of the street but shall not change the grade or contour of the street
right-of-way, nor shall any person cut into, fill, or in any way alter any
gutter, curbing, drainage ditch or storm drain within the right-of-way of
a street or easement for the purposes of extending a driveway.
G. Commercial district driveways/joint and cross access.
(1) The Planning Commission may require a joint driveway in order to
achieve the following driveway spacing standards that are
desirable for arterial and major collector roads:
(a) Principal arterial: 600 feet.
(b) Minor arterial: 400 feet.
(c) Major collector: 200 feet.
(2) Adjacent commercial properties shall provide a joint or cross
access driveway to allow circulation between sites wherever
feasible along roadways classified as major collectors or arterials in
accordance with the functional classification contained in the
municipal comprehensive plan. The following shall apply to joint
and cross access driveways:
(a) The driveway shall have a design speed of 10 miles per hour
and have sufficient width to accommodate two-way traffic,
including the largest vehicle expected to frequently access the
properties.
(b) A circulation plan that may include coordinated or shared
parking shall be required.
§ 440-503 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-503
C:928
(c) Features shall be included in the site design to make it visually
obvious that abutting properties shall be tied in to include
cross access.
(3) The property owners along a joint or cross access driveway shall:
(a) Record an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and
from other properties served by the driveway.
(b) Record an agreement with the municipality so that future
access rights along the driveway shall be granted at the
discretion of the municipality and the design shall be approved
by the municipal engineer.
(c) Record a joint agreement with the deed defining the
maintenance responsibilities of each of the property owners
located along the driveway.
H. Clear sight triangles. To maintain adequate visibility at driveways and
roadway intersections, safe sight distance shall be constructed and
maintained as defined by § 440-503A. See Part 12, Appendixes, for clear
sight triangle diagram.

C:931
addition to the tree and plant list, the Township will consider suggested
plantings by the landowner/developer.
C. All plantings not surviving for three planting seasons shall be replaced.
All landscaped areas including swales shall be maintained in a healthy
growing condition, neat and orderly appearance, and kept free from
refuse and debris. All landscaping shall be so arranged and maintained
as not to obscure the vision of traffic or hide fire hydrants. No vehicles
shall be parked nor shall parking be provided for vehicles in the
portions of a site required to be landscaped.
D. Landscape plans.
(1) A landscape plan, with appropriate details, shall be prepared and
submitted at the time of site plan or subdivision and land
development application. The landscape plan shall contain and
show the following information:
(a) All required buffer areas with proposed plantings (identifying
each proposed tree, bush or shrub) drawn to scale and
identifying the height and width of any proposed mounds.
(b) All required planting independent of any buffer area
requirements (identifying each tree, bush, shrub, the use of
sod or seeding, etc.) drawn to scale.
(c) Any planting in excess of the requirements in this Part 5.
(d) Any existing trees or vegetation that are to be preserved,
accurately identifying their relative size and location.
(e) Any existing trees or vegetation that will be removed,
accurately identifying their relative size and location.
(2) All landscape plans for parking lots 5,000 square feet or greater
shall be designed by a landscape architect or other professional
nurseryman.
E. Interior parking lot landscaping. [Added 5-13-2019 by Ord. No. 841]
(1) Parking lots should be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs
to reduce glare, to delineate driving lanes and to reduce reflected
heat.
(a) Perpendicular stall design. In nonresidential and mixed-use
districts, one planting island of at least nine feet in width shall
be provided for every double row of 15 stalls. Each planting
island shall extend to the full length of both parking spaces.
For nonresidential projects in residential zones, one planting
island of at least nine feet in width shall be provided for every
double row of 10 parking stalls. The planting island shall
contain one shade tree plus shrubs and/or groundcover for the
island's entire area.
§ 440-504 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-504
C:932
(b) Angled stall design. In all districts, double rows of abutting
angled spaces shall include a continuous landscaping divider
strip nine feet wide centered on the dividing line, protected by
curbing and planted with grass or other landscaping materials
with no less than one shade tree for each five, or remaining
thereof, abutting spaces counted down one side.
F. The Township shall require tree planting at the base of a slope to
provide a visual screen. [Added 5-13-2019 by Ord. No. 841]
G. Landscaping required in buffer areas as outlined in § 440-504 cannot be
substituted for any required landscaping mandated in this section.
[Added 5-13-2019 by Ord. No. 841]
H. Landscaping for service structures. All service structures shall be fully
screened, except when located in the Industrial (I) District. Service
structures in the Industrial (I) shall be fully screened when located
within 100 feet of any zoning district other than Industrial (I). For the
purposes of this subsection, service structures shall include propane
tanks, dumpsters, air conditioning units and condensers, electrical
transformers and other equipment or elements providing service to a
building or a site. [Added 5-13-2019 by Ord. No. 841]
(1) Location of screening. A continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall or
earthen mounding shall enclose any service structure on all sides
unless such structure must be frequently moved, in which case
screening on all but one side is required. The average height of the
screening material shall be one foot more than the height of the
enclosed structure but shall not be required to exceed eight feet in
height. When a service structure is located next to a building wall,
perimeter landscaping material may fulfill the screening
requirements for that side of the service structure if that wall or
screening material is of an average height sufficient to meet the
height requirement set out in this section. Whenever service
structures are screened by plant material, such material may count
towards the fulfillment of required landscaping.
(2) Protection of screening material. Whenever screening material is
placed around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit that
is emptied or removed mechanically on a regular basis, a fixed
barrier to contain the placement of the container shall be provided
within the screening material on those sides where there is such
material. The barrier shall be at least 18 inches from the material
and shall be of sufficient strength to prevent possible damage to
the screening when the container is moved. The minimum front
opening of the screening material shall be 12 feet to allow service
vehicles access to the container.
I. If a landowner and/or developer provides landscaping within the lot
equal to 1 1/2 times the required quantity and total area to be planted
as defined by this chapter, Township Council may grant the landowner
§ 440-504 CHARTER § 440-504
C:933
§ 440-505. Buffering/screening.
and/or developer a development bonus of up to 10% of the total
nonresidential gross floor area. [Added 5-13-2019 by Ord. No. 841]
A. To minimize potential physical and/or visual conflicts between uses,
buffer areas shall be provided in certain situations. Buffer areas shall be
required in conjunction with the development of any lot, as defined by
Figure 500.4, Buffer Areas. Naturally existing wooded or vegetative
areas may be able to serve as any of the buffers as required in Figure
500.4. The Township may require additional plantings to supplement
the naturally preserved buffer area. [Amended 5-13-2019 by Ord.

combination of deciduous and evergreen shrubs planted at an
initial height of not less than three feet; or
(c) Masonry wall or wooden fence with a minimum opacity of 80%
and a minimum height of five feet.
C. Buffer area maintenance.
(1) The buffer area shall be provided and maintained by the landowner,
developer or tenant of the said lot between any nonresidential or
mixed-use district or use and contiguous residentially zoned
districts, except where natural or physical man-made barriers exist
that will duplicate the effect of the landscape screen.
(2) In a buffer area, the existing grade shall be maintained for a
distance of at least eight feet to provide adequate width for plant
material, and the maximum grade in the remainder of the buffer
area shall not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
(3) All plants not surviving three planting seasons shall be replaced.
A. Intent and purpose. These regulations are intended to maintain
ambient lighting levels as low as possible in order to enhance the
Township's community character and charm and maintain dark skies.
Area lighting should provide good visibility, minimum glare and
minimum spillage onto abutting properties or into the sky. It is the
intent of this section to encourage, through the regulation of the types,
kinds, construction, installation and uses of outdoor electrically
powered illuminating devices, lighting practices and systems to
conserve energy without decreasing safety, utility, security and
productivity while enhancing nighttime enjoyment of property and
night skies. These regulations are intended to be consistent with the
requirements of the National Electrical Code (NEC), as referenced in
the International Residential Code and the International Building Code.
B. Exterior lighting shall be:
(1) Architecturally integrated with the character of the associated
structures, site design, landscape and zoning districts;
(2) Directed downward and shielded, or specifically directed to walls,
landscape elements or other similar features, so that light is
confined within the boundaries of the subject parcel;
(3) Installed so that lights do not blink, flash or be of unusually high
intensity or brightness;
(4) Appropriate in height, intensity and scale to the uses and the site
they are serving; and
§ 440-505 CHARTER § 440-506
C:937
(5) Installed in conformance with the provisions of this section, the
Building Code, the Electrical Code, and the site plan approval.
C. Exceptions. The following outdoor lighting is not subject to the
provisions of this section:
(1) All outdoor light fixtures existing and legally installed prior to the
effective date of this section except:
(a) When 50% or more of the existing luminaires are
reconstructed or replaced; or
(b) When a tenant or use change causes a change in the hours of
operation or intensity of nighttime use.
(2) Lights used for holiday decorations, when displayed during the
period of display of the Township's public holiday decorations.
(3) Portable temporary lighting used by law enforcement or
emergency services personnel to protect life or property.
(4) In single-family residential zones, fixtures containing lamps
emitting less than the 1,800 lumens (26 watts for fluorescent
lighting, 50 watts for high-intensity discharge, and 100 watts for
incandescent), provided that the light fixture is fully shielded and
properly focused downward to minimize glare and spill light into
the night sky and onto adjacent properties and does not exceed a
height of 15 feet.
(5) Streetlights erected on public or private right-of-way. Streetlight
design is to be in compliance with the Township streetlighting
policy.
(6) Lighting associated with a special event must be approved by the
Peters Township Council.
D. Lighting standards.
(1) Parking area illumination levels.
(a) The minimum maintained illumination requirement is one
footcandle in the general parking areas. "General parking
areas" are defined as being 80% of a parking lot, excluding
entrances or traffic lanes directly in front of store entrances,
for commercial zones with a maximum illumination of eight
footcandles and an average not to exceed three footcandles, in
general parking areas. Lighting plans should be designed so
that higher traffic areas have sufficient lighting. Vertical lamps
shall be utilized for lights on poles. Wall-mounted lights may
utilize horizontal lamps, provided that they are fully shielded.
Lenses shall not protrude below the lamp screening material;
that is, sag lenses are not permissible.
§ 440-506 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-506
C:938
(b) Subject to Planning Commission approval, the minimum
maintained footcandle requirement may be reduced in parking
areas which are provided with a significant level of ambient
light; in parking areas that utilize a lighter colored parking
surface, such as concrete; and in parking areas located along a
transition with sensitive land uses. Also, subject to Planning
Commission approval, the minimum maintained footcandle
requirement may exceed one footcandle when necessary for
security or other purposes.
(2) Entrance lighting. Multifamily residential and nonresidential
development should provide glare-free light fixtures at building
entrances and exits. Nonresidential developments shall provide for
lighting in accordance with this chapter at all vehicle and
pedestrian entrances and on-site vehicle intersections. Entrance
lighting may not exceed a height of 12 feet and must be highpressure
sodium. In order to promote safety, lighting levels at
entrances shall be equal to the average level of the associated
parking lot.
(3) Spillover lighting. With the exception of light sources that do not
exceed a height of three feet above finished grade, light sources
must be a full cutoff so as to not direct light skyward, and shall be
so arranged by means of filters or shields to avoid reflecting
lighting onto adjoining properties or streets. Lighting fixtures that
do not exceed a height of three feet above finished grade shall be
properly focused to minimize glare and spill light into the night sky
and onto adjacent properties.
(4) Height.
(a) In nonresidential zoning districts, the height of parking lot
lighting must be in scale with the building and structure
heights on the site. The lighting between the building and the
property line shall be full cutoff, shielded wall-mounted or
shielded freestanding light poles.
(b) Building-mounted lights may be mounted no higher than 18
feet and must be a full cutoff. Lighting may not be mounted
above the roofline.
(c) In all commercial zoning districts as well as the IN Industrial
Zoning District, pole heights shall not exceed 25 feet. For
noncommercial uses, such as a church or a community facility
in a residential zoning district, the height of freestanding light
poles shall not exceed 20 feet in height.
(d) Notwithstanding the above, the height of a freestanding light
fixture shall not exceed the heights listed above. The Planning
Commission has the authority to allow the erection of lighting
fixtures in excess of the light height limits in order to provide
compatibility with adjoining properties and streets. When such
§ 440-506 CHARTER § 440-506
C:939
lighting is located in parking areas located along or adjacent
to areas with sensitive land uses, such as residential uses,
the Planning Commission has the authority to limit the height,
style, and placement of lights to architecturally integrate with
the character of the site and adjoining land uses.
(5) Decorative lighting. In the Town Center District, decorative
lighting shall be utilized. Decorative lights shall be placed along
sidewalks in the front and along the public roadway as shown in the
picture below. The decorative light used shall be consistent
throughout the district, and shall comply with Part 6.
Figure 500.7
Sample of Decorative Lighting
(6) Hours of operation.
(a) All off-street parking areas associated with multifamily
residential, commercial, industrial, and nonresidential uses
shall be illuminated at night. Multifamily residential lighting
systems shall provide the full illumination required herein
throughout the night hours. Nonresidential uses shall provide
the full illumination required during hours the facility is
accessible to customers, employees, and other users with a
maximum of 50% of full illumination provided throughout the
remainder of the night.
(b) Outdoor lighting used for illumination for walkways, private
roadways and streets, equipment yards and outdoor security
may remain on all night.
(c) Outdoor lighting used for outdoor sales and eating areas,
assembly or repair areas, signs, recreational facilities and
other similar applications shall be off between the 30 minutes
after the closing of the business and sunrise. Areas which
contain approved permanent outdoor storage may be lighted at
50% of full illumination.
(7) Permitted lamp fixture types.
§ 440-506 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-506
C:940
§ 440-507. Off-street parking and loading.
(a) Lighting in parking areas is limited to high-pressure sodium.
Metal halide may be utilized to light architectural elements
and pedestrian walkways.
(b) Lighting of private recreational facilities in the single-family
and multifamily residential zoning districts (LD, WP, CL, MD,
VR and RR) shall be directed downward and shielded so that
light is confined to the recreation facility and within the
boundaries of the property. Lights shall only be on when the
facility is in use. Lighting for outdoor recreation facilities is
also subject to § 440-601, public, private, and semiprivate
recreation facility.
(c) Lighting for signs shall comply with Part 7.
(8) The Township of Peters reserves the right to require adjustments to
outdoor lighting after a new site comes on-line and lighting
problems or issues are found to exist.
A. Parking ratios.
(1) Any building or structure erected, altered, or used and any lot used
or occupied for any of the following purposes shall be provided with
the minimum number of parking spaces set forth in Figure 500.8 or
500.9, as determined by the Zoning Officer or Planning Director,
unless reserve parking or shared parking are being used or the
conditions in Subsection A(4) below apply.
(2) In addition to the regulations in Figure 500.9, Minimum Off-Street
Parking Space Requirements by Use, the Township may require the
developer to provide up to one visitor space for every two units
within a multifamily development and may require additional
parking facilities for recreational buildings or areas.
(3) Parking space minimum requirements for uses not provided in
Figure 500.9 shall be determined by the Township Planning
Commission as a component of site plan review and approval.
(4) Any future change in land use for structures or parts of structures
exceeding 10,000 square feet in gross floor area shall require a
recalculation of the required parking. The recalculation of parking
shall be submitted to and approved by Township Planning staff
prior to the change in use. In the case of shared parking, if the
mixture of uses shall change from the original calculation, a new
shared parking calculation shall be required to be submitted to the
Township Planning staff for approval.
(5) When a parking space minimum requirement must be established
for a commercial center, land development or building exceeding
10,000 square feet in gross floor area in which the uses cannot be
§ 440-506 CHARTER § 440-507
C:941
reasonably determined or estimated, the Township may apply the
following general minimums based on gross floor area:

100,000 to 399,999 1:200
400,000 or greater 1:250
(6) In any case, the Township reserves the right to adjust the minimum
requirement based on site configuration, context of surrounding
area and any information available on intended land use.

(2) Required stacking spaces are subject to the following design and
layout standards.
(a) The size of a stacking or queuing space shall be 19 feet in
length by nine feet in width.
(b) Each lane shall be clearly defined in a manner that is
identifiable during all seasons.
(c) Stacking spaces may not impede on- or off-site traffic
movements or movement into or out of off-street parking
spaces.
(d) Stacking spaces must be separated from other internal
roadways for traffic movement and safety.
C. Parking held in reserve. If the number of spaces required above is
substantially larger than the number of spaces anticipated by the
applicant, then the applicant may hold some of the parking in reserve in
order to avoid unnecessary paving while ensuring adequate area for
potential parking demands.
(1) Suitable area must be available on the site for 100% of the parking
required above.
(2) The number of spaces which must be paved initially may be
reduced by up to 50% by the Township Council or Planning
Commission. All stormwater engineering shall be designed based
on total parking requirements, including the reserve.
(3) Applicants that anticipate a need for more than 120% of the
required parking spaces should design their developments with
suitable area for the balance of the total number of spaces
required. These spaces shall be held in reserve. The reserve
parking spaces shall be constructed by the applicant if and when
determined necessary by the Township Council or Planning
Commission, upon recommendation of the Zoning Officer.
(4) The Township may require installation of these parking spaces
under the following conditions:
(a) When there is evidence of a continued overflow of parking as
installed by the applicant.
§ 440-507 CHARTER § 440-507
C:949
(b) When a reevaluation of the parking capacity by the Zoning
Officer shows that future parking needs will not be met. The
parking capacity shall be reevaluated whenever there is a
change in use, ownership, number of employees, number of
residents, building size, and/or land area.
D. Maximum parking. The maximum amount of permitted parking shall be
150% of the minimum required parking, unless the Township Council or
Planning Commission requires installation of additional parking, as
outlined in Subsection C above.
E. Shared parking.
(1) The parking spaces required in the above standards may be
reduced by an amount determined by the Planning Director when it
can be demonstrated through a parking demand study that
sufficient parking is already available or can be provided by the
subject uses through shared parking.
(a) The parking demand study shall provide evidence about
anticipated parking demand at peak times and the distance
relationship between shared parking spaces and the specific
uses to be served.
(b) Some portion of the shared off-street parking area shall lie
within 200 feet of an entrance, regularly used by patrons, into
the buildings to be served by the shared parking.
(c) Access and parking easements shall be prepared and recorded
for each property to be served by the shared parking.
(2) The use of shared parking shall be required when the development
is under the control of a single owner/developer and contains
commercial, retail, office, institutional, or public uses with
staggered peak parking demands. A parking demand study is
encouraged for all development and redevelopment to optimize
available parking resources, minimize construction and
maintenance costs and enhance community character.
(3) The minimum amount of shared parking required shall be
calculated by the Township according to the shared parking
calculator maintained by the Planning Department.
(4) A written agreement involving all parties to shared parking
arrangements shall be kept on file with the Township. An example
agreement appears in Part 12, Appendixes, of this chapter.
F. Accessibility requirements.
(1) The quantity of handicapped spaces for a land development shall be
included within the total number of parking spaces required.
§ 440-507 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-507
C:950
(2) The proportion and access of handicapped spaces required by a
land development shall conform to the requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines, US
Access Board.
(3) One in every eight accessible spaces, but not less than one, shall be
served by an access aisle a minimum of 96 inches wide and shall be
designated as "van accessible."
(4) All signage designating accessible spaces shall be in accordance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the
Pennsylvania Vehicle Code requirements.
G. Design and layout.
(1) Surface parking areas provided on-site for new development shall
be located at the side, to the rear or at the face of a building that
does not front along a street. Corners of primary street
intersections shall be avoided in the location of parking lots, as
shall the space between a building and the adjacent street frontage
it faces. Partial or full underground parking may be used.
(2) The Township Council or Planning Commission shall approve one of
the following incentives for parking lots in land or building
redevelopment that provides a minimum of 80% of the required
parking spaces between the building(s) rear face and rear lot line
or side face(s) and side lot line(s):
(a) A gross floor area increase of 15% of a lot's net buildable area.
(b) A building height increase of eight feet.
(c) A reduction of the minimum front and/or side yard setbacks.
(3) Where parking lots are allowed to locate, or remain between the
face of a building and its street frontage, a five-foot-wide planting
area shall be provided between the parking lot and the street rightof-
way.
H. Surface parking area specifications.
(1) Off-street parking spaces provided in a surface parking lot shall not
be located any closer than 10 feet to the right-of-way line of a
public or private roadway. The area between the right-of-way and
off-street parking spaces shall be seeded and planted with
shrubbery, trees or other landscaped barrier that will prevent the
shining of lights from the parking area onto the roadway and in
accordance with § 440-504 as appropriate.
(2) Parking lot interconnections shall be required. In all commercial,
industrial, and mixed-use districts, the landowner and/or developer
shall provide a two-way access point in the side yard. If
development exists on an adjacent lot, then the access point shall
§ 440-507 CHARTER § 440-507
C:951
be located so that the maximum traffic flow between parking lots
can ultimately occur.
(3) At least 50% of all parking spaces required within a multifamily
development shall be roofed and enclosed on three sides.
(4) If more than 50% of the use's required parking is located between a
public right-of-way line and the front facade of a building, the front
yard buffer area shall be a minimum of 25 feet.
(5) Parking lots shall be constructed in accordance with applicable
requirements of § 440-508.
I. Parking garage/structure specifications.
(1) No parking garage/structure shall exceed 35 feet in height above

§ 440-510. Maximum peak hour traffic volumes and traffic impact.
A. The peak hour trip calculations shall be defined by the guidelines and
procedures outlined in the most current edition of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Handbook and the ITE
Trip Generation Manual.
B. The threshold requirement for a traffic impact study is 75 peak hour
trips. This shall apply regardless of the type of land use proposed. A
study may also be required of the developer even if the threshold is not
met when the development is located in an area with known traffic
deficiencies. The study shall determine what, if any, improvements will
need to be constructed and maintained as part of the development. The
study shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. The Planning Director may waive the study requirement for an
individual development, where said development was incorporated as
part of a previously approved traffic impact study.
C. Technical aspects of the traffic impact study should be performed in
accordance with the most recent edition of PennDOT's Policy and
Procedures for Transportation Impact Studies and the most recent
edition of ITE's Recommended Practice for Traffic Access and Impact
Studies for Site Development.
D. The traffic study shall be signed and sealed by a licensed engineer from
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with experience in traffic
engineering.
E. Traffic impact study process. Prior to beginning a traffic impact study,
the landowner and/or developer shall submit a proposed scope of
services to the Planning Director for review and approval. If the scope
of study includes access to any state highway, a traffic study scoping
meeting should be held jointly with PennDOT. The traffic impact study
shall include the following if determined to be appropriate by the
Planning Director:
(1) A brief description of the proposed project in terms of land use and
magnitude.
(2) An inventory and analysis of existing roadway and traffic conditions
in the site environs including:
(a) Roadway network, roadway classification, and traffic control.
(b) Existing traffic volumes in terms of peak hours and average
daily traffic (ADT); data collection to be conducted in
accordance with the data collection and analysis
methodologies outlined in PennDOT Publication 46 Traffic
Engineering Manual.

review, driveway sight distance, intersection sight distance,
etc.
(3) Proposed site-generated traffic volumes in terms of:
(a) Peak hours and ADT (by development phase if required)
including any pass-by trip calculations and internal capture
calculations outlined in the most current edition of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation
Handbook and the ITE Trip Generation Manual.
(b) Arrival/departure distribution to be approved by the Planning
Director.
(c) Site traffic volumes on study roadways.
(4) An analysis of future traffic conditions including:
(a) Future opening year no build and combined traffic volumes
(site traffic plus future background roadway traffic). Opening
year is the projected year of opening for the proposed
development or change in use. For phased developments, the
Planning Director will determine which year or years are to be
analyzed.
(b) Future design year no build and combined traffic volumes (site
traffic plus future roadway traffic). Design year is projected to
five years beyond the expected opening year of the
development/change in use. In the case of a phased
development, the design year shall be five years beyond full
buildout of the final phase of the development. The Planning
Director may waive the analysis of the design year if the overall
development generates fewer than 3,000 trips per day or fewer
than 100 entering or 100 exiting trips during the peak hour of
the development.
(c) Level of service as defined by the current edition of the
Transportation Research Board's (TRB) Highway Capacity
Manual approved for use in Pennsylvania by PennDOT; level of
service to be reported by lane group, approach, and overall

defined study area as defined by the current edition of the
Transportation Research Board's (TRB) Highway Capacity
Manual approved for use in Pennsylvania by PennDOT.
(5) A description of future levels of service and their compliance with
standards for traffic capacity of streets, intersections and
driveways. New streets shall be designed for adequate traffic
capacity defined as follows, all referenced by the current edition of
the Transportation Research Board's (TRB) Highway Capacity
Manual approved for use in Pennsylvania by PennDOT.
(a) Traffic capacity level of service (LOS) shall be based upon
future design year analysis.
(b) New or modified (a new approach created) unsignalized
intersections or driveways which intersect streets shall be
designed for an overall LOS C or better unless otherwise
specified by the Planning Director. Additional mitigation or
turn restrictions may be imposed if individual lane groups or
approaches are LOS E or LOS F at a new/modified unsignalized
intersection or driveway.
(c) New or modified (a new approach created) signalized
intersections shall be designed for an overall LOS C or better,
unless otherwise specified by the Township. Additional
mitigation may be required if individual lane groups or
approaches are LOS E or LOS F at a new/modified signalized
intersection.
(d) Existing intersections impacted by development traffic shall
maintain a minimum overall LOS D, or, if future base (without
development traffic) overall LOS E then mitigation shall be
made to maintain overall LOS E with development traffic. If
future base overall LOS F, then any degradation in terms of
overall vehicle delay shall be mitigated. Additional mitigation
§ 440-510 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-510
C:960
may be required by the Planning Director if critical lane groups
or approaches degrade below LOS D (i.e., LOS E or LOS F).
(e) New streets shall be defined for a minimum LOS C.
(f) Existing roadway segments impacted by development traffic
shall maintain a minimum LOS D for each direction, or, if
future base (without development traffic) LOS E or LOS F then
degradation in LOS shall be mitigated.
(g) If sufficient evidence is provided that the above LOS criteria
cannot be met with reasonable mitigation, then the Planning
Director may modify LOS requirements thought the use of a
ten-second variance in accordance with the most recent edition
of PennDOT's Policy and Procedures for Transportation Impact
Studies or the Planning Director may waive the LOS
requirements altogether. If the LOS requirements are waived
by the Planning Director, an alternative transportation
mitigation as described in PennDOT's Policy and Procedures
for Transportation Impact Studies maybe be required by the
Planning Director.

C:961
§ 440-511. Vegetative preservation.
Vegetation preservation applicable to a landowner and/or developer of a
land development is governed by the specifications in this section and the
provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(b) Off-site improvement plan depicting required roadway and
signal installation and signing improvements to meet the
minimum level of service requirements.
F. Traffic control devices and other traffic improvements. Whenever, as a
result of additional traffic generated by a proposed development, the
traffic impact study determines the need for a traffic signal or
regulatory sign, additional traffic lanes (acceleration, deceleration or
turning) or other traffic improvements to be constructed on the
landowner and/or developer's property or on the property abutting the
landowner and/or developer's property, the landowner and/or developer
shall, as a condition to approval of the final plat, agree to construct the
improvements at the landowner and/or developer's cost, or in lieu
thereof, and with the written consent of the Township, reimburse the
Township for the cost of the improvements.
G. Wherever ITE, TRB, or PennDOT publications are referenced in this
section, it shall be assumed that the most recent edition of such
publications or in the event that a publication has been superseded by
another manual/publication/handbook, the most recent edition of the
successor publication is to be used to satisfy the requirements of this
section. The Planning Director shall make the final determination
regarding any standards, methodologies, or publications to be used in
the preparation of the traffic impact analysis.
A. Vegetation preservation. The removal of trees, shrubbery, foliage, grass
or other natural growth shall be permitted when in conformance with
the provisions of this chapter or any other chapter of the Township
regulating land use, development and logging as approved by the
Township Council. The activity of grubbing (defined as the cleaning of
underbrush from a well-treed area) shall be permitted with the
expressed approval of the Planning Director. A landscape plan shall be
prepared and submitted at the time of subdivision and/or land
development application, bearing the seal of a registered landscape
architect.
B. Cutting and clearing of vegetation; violations and penalties.
(1) Forestry activities of timber harvesting and/or logging, whether by
clear-cutting, selective cutting or other common practice, shall be
permitted in any zoning district. All forestry activities shall comply
with Chapter 402, Trees, Article I, Logging and Timber Harvesting,
of the Peters Township Code of Ordinances.
§ 440-510 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-511
C:962
(2) The cutting of trees and/or clearing of vegetation within the
maximum buffer area which could be applicable to the lot, as
required by § 440-505, or within the minimum building setback as
required by Part 4, whichever is greater, unless incidental to
imminent development, is prohibited. Grubbing activity, as defined
in Subsection A, is permitted where the purpose is to improve the
appearance of the lot.
(3) "Imminent development" shall be considered to be development
which is reasonably expected to commence and for which there are
realistic plans to commence on a minimum basis of eight hours per
day, 40 hours per week (utilizing a standard workweek basis of five
on, two off) within 60 days of the completed cutting activities and
for which a subdivision or land development plan or plat and a
conceptual landscape plan has been submitted and approved by the
Township.
(4) The penalty for violating this section shall be a maximum of $500
for each day in excess of 60 that the cleared lot is not subject to
significant development activities, as defined above, unless the lack
of significant development for time in excess of 60 days following
the clearing of the lot occurred for reasons other than a lack of
reasonable expectations as to when development would and could
commence and/or a lack of realistic plans for the commencement of
development. This language is not intended to prohibit the cutting
of diseased, dead or dying plants or trees, the development of
flower or vegetable gardens or the removal of single trees or
clumps of vegetation for aesthetic, safety or other concerns. It does
prohibit the mass or large-scale defoliation of a lot preparatory to
development until shortly before the proposed development
actually takes place.
(5) In addition to any other remedy available to the Township and in
the event that the construction of structures and/or infrastructure
on the site does not commence despite an approved land
development plan within six months of the completion of the
clearing operations as determined by the Township, the disturbed
site shall be reforested in accordance with requirements for the
applicable buffer area or, if in the area of any required minimum
setback not within a required buffer area, in accordance with the
spacing and planning variety required for Buffer Area A. Should
this six-month period fall during a season not conducive to planting,
the Township may permit the developer and/or landowner to delay
this reforestation until a time more conducive, but shall commence,
in no case, any later than April 1. Furthermore, at the time of the
land development plan or plat approval, the Township shall require
that a performance bond be provided, in the favor of the Township,
to guarantee this reforestation, in an amount approved by the
Township Engineer. The lot must be reforested with a species

comparable to the predominant species on the lot prior to the
commencement of the clearing operations.
(6) The landscape plan required by § 440-504 shall show the location
and species of all existing trees six inches in diameter at breast
height (dbh). All such trees shall be marked in the field in order
that they may be inspected by the Township. Applicants are
encouraged to maximize the retention of all healthy existing trees
six inches or more dbh. All trees, including those not listed by the
Township Planning Department, are subject to approval by the
Township Planning Department with respect to health, location and
species type. Trees to be preserved should not be disturbed within
the dripline. Any change to the existing grade within the dripline
shall disqualify the opportunity for credits. A developer preserving
existing approved trees shall be entitled to the following credits
from the buffer area requirements of § 440-505:
(a) Eighteen-inch dbh or greater tree located in required buffer
areas: six trees.
(b) Eighteen-inch dbh or greater tree located outside required
buffer areas: seven trees.
(c) Twelve-inch to eighteen-inch dbh located in required buffer
areas: four trees.

and non-gravity walls in side and rear yards shall not exceed a
height of six feet. Fence height measurements shall not include
projections above fence posts, decorative features, or other
protrusions. A permit to erect a nongravity wall and/or fence shall
be required in accordance with the regulations of the Township
Planning Department. Athletic fields and similar recreation
facilities are exempt from the six-foot height restriction. (See Part
6.)
C. Fences.
(1) Fences shall be defined to include a front and back face. The
finished side of the fence shall be considered the front face and the
front face shall be oriented toward the exterior of a lot so that a
maximum of 80% of each structural member of the fence, unless a
split rail fence, shall be visible from an adjacent lot.
(2) Privacy fences shall include fences with slat spacing of less than
one inch.
(3) No fence in the residential zoning districts shall be barbed wire or
electric, excluding use on a farm.

preference criteria. The landowner and/or developer shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the approving authority that
these preferences have been evaluated and followed in their
proposed site selection.
Antennas located on Township-owned buildings and structures.
The landowner and/or developer must demonstrate that there
is no suitable Township-owned building or structure within the
appropriate search radius as identified in Subsection C colocation
requests below which would accommodate the facility
without unreasonably compromising the facility's signal
reception or transmitting capability or unreasonably
compromising the communication provider system's capability.
(a)
If a facility cannot be located on candidate sites within site
preference outlined above without unreasonably
compromising the communication provider system's capability,
the Township will next consider sites for antennas located
on non-Township-owned buildings and structures. No
communication tower shall be located upon a property and/or
on a building or structure that is listed on either the National
or Pennsylvania Registers of Historic Places.
(b)
If a facility cannot be located on candidate sites within site
preference Class A or B above without unreasonably
compromising the communication provider system's capability,
the Township will next consider sites for towers located on IN
Industrial zoned lots. If no IN Industrial zoned lot is available
in the specified search radius, the search radius must be
widened to include IN Industrial zoned lots.
(c)
(1)
The approving authority of the Township may require opinions from
suitable engineers or other learned professionals or experts when
evaluating siting preferences.
(2)
A.
Placement restriction criteria. All proposed towers shall conform to
the following placement restriction criteria in addition to the restricted
areas established by this section.
(1) No tower shall be placed in traffic circles or on bridges.
B.
§ 440-601 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-601

to the side or rear of the principal structure within applicable
setback and height limitations in the zoning district.
(a)
Towers supporting multichannel multipoint distribution service
(MMDS) antennas and direct broadcast satellite service (DBS)
antennas when the antennas are no larger than three feet in
diameter or diagonal measurement, and television broadcast
receiving antennas. Such towers shall conform to all applicable
provisions of this Code and shall be allowed subject to building
permit approval only in the buildable area of the lot to the side
or rear of the principal structure placed in accordance with the
applicable setback and height limitations of the zoning district.
(b)
Commercial wireless telecommunication antennas conforming
to all applicable provisions of this chapter may be permitted
by Township administrative approval only in the following
locations:

Co-location requirements. All communication towers and antennas
erected, constructed, or located within the Township shall comply with
the following requirements prior to the Township approval of a request
for co-location:
Use of existing tower or building.
A proposed new communication tower shall not be approved
by the Township unless the landowner and/or developer
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the approving authority
that the telecommunications equipment planned for the
proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or
approved tower or building, regardless of Township
boundaries within the following search radius:
(a)

Search Radius
(miles)
Tower Height
(feet)
1 More than or equal to 119
1/2 80 to 119
1/4 Less than 80
Because of one or more of the following reasons:
The planned equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of the existing or approved tower or building,
as documented by a qualified and Pennsylvania licensed
professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower
cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to
accommodate the planned or equivalent equipment at a
reasonable cost.
[1]
The planned equipment would cause interference or
obstruction materially impacting the usability of other
existing or planned equipment at the tower or building
as documented by a qualified and Pennsylvania licensed,
if applicable, professional and the interference cannot be
prevented at a reasonable cost.
[2]
Existing or approved towers and buildings within the
search radius cannot accommodate the planned
equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably
as documented by a qualified and Pennsylvania licensed,
professional engineer.
[3]
Verifiable evidence from the landowner and/or developer
of the lack of space on existing towers, building or other
structures to locate the proposed antenna within the
appropriate search radius as identified in this section or
the siting preferences identified in this section shall be
supplied at the time of application for a new tower.
[4]
(b)
Antenna array heights.
Any proposed communication tower shall be designed,
structurally, electrically and in all other respects to
accommodate antennas arrays as follows:

Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement
of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted
at varying heights. The above antenna array heights are the
minimum number required per tower.
(b)
In order to provide the maximum opportunity for other providers
to co-locate on a new tower, the landowner and/or developer shall
provide notice to all other potential wireless telecommunication
users of the new tower, offering an opportunity for co-location.
If another potential user requests co-location in writing to the
Township, the request shall be accommodated, unless it can be
documented as outlined in this section that co-location is not
possible.
(3)
Co-location map. In order to encourage co-location of facilities,
the Township shall maintain a map of all existing towers on which
an antenna has been located. To prepare and maintain such a
map, at the time of its first application after the effective date
of this chapter, each landowner and/or developer for a tower and
or antenna shall provide the Township with an inventory of all
the landowner's and/or developer's existing towers and antennas
that are located in the Township and within one mile outside the
Township limits. The inventory shall specify the location, type and
design of each tower, the ability of the tower to accommodate
additional antenna and, where applicable, the height of the support
structures on which the landowner's and/or developer's existing
antennas are located. This information shall be available for public
use in encouraging the co-location of antennas or existing tower
facilities. By requiring and using this information, the Township
is in no way representing or approving such sites as available or
suitable.
(4)
Additional standards and criteria for review of wireless towers/
antennas:
The intent and purpose of this subsection is to address and balance
the concern that communication towers may not be appropriate
uses in and near residential areas due to aesthetic and
(1)
D.
§ 440-601 CHARTER § 440-601
C:987
compatibility conflicts that arise when these facilities are located
in close proximity to residential uses and the recognized need
of the services the wireless telecommunication towers provide to
the public. These issues shall be reviewed, based on the adopted
standards, on a case-by-case basis for each request. The approving
authority shall consider and weigh the aesthetic impact and
compatibility issues with the public benefit derived from having
an efficient and reliable wireless telecommunications system when
determining whether or not to approve the application.
In addition to general review criteria, in order to be approved,
towers and antennas shall be designed, as determined by the
approving authority, to blend into the surrounding environment
through the use of color, texture, and/or camouflaging architectural
treatment, or by reason of existing conditions, to minimize its visual
intrusiveness and negative aesthetic impact. When considering
approval of an application, the approving authority shall review
such application with consideration of the following factors:
Whether the tower will be readily visible and whether the
proposed facility/tower will, as determined by the approving
authority, unreasonably interfere with the view from any public
park, historic building or district, or scenic view.
(a)
Type of tower, the shape and width of the facility relative to
its height, and the color, texture, and reflectivity of materials,
with neutral colors and nonreflective materials being given
preference, except in instances where the color is dictated
by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation
Administration.
(b)
Type of antennas proposed for the tower, with narrow profile
antenna arrays being given preference, if feasible.
(c)
Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties and the
relationship of the proposed facility to the character and scale
of surrounding structures and uses, with preference being
given to sites adjacent to nonresidential uses.
(d)
(e) On-site and surrounding tree coverage and foliage.
The effectiveness of the use of screening and concealment
devices and techniques, including but not limited to the use
of structural camouflaging, buffer walls, opaque fencing and
landscaping.
(f)
(2)
Tower and antenna design and construction requirements. New or
replacement towers and antennas shall meet the following design and
construction requirements:
The base of the tower, anchors, and any accessory facility or
building shall be substantially screened from view from public
(1)
E.
§ 440-601 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-601
C:988
streets and adjoining and nearby residential properties with a
combination of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs, except
when the Township Zoning Hearing Board determines a design
of nonvegetated screening better reflects and complements the
architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood. The use
of all types of barbed wire, razor wire, and similar items is
prohibited. No types of chain-link fencing shall be used as buffering
or screening material.
All ground-mounted communication towers shall be of a monopole
design unless the approving authority determines that an
alternative design would better blend into the particular
surrounding environment.
(2)
With the exception of necessary electric and telephone service
and connection lines approved by the Township, no part of any
tower, anchoring devices, or guys, equipment, wires or braces
in connection herewith shall at any time extend, project across
or over any part of a public right-of-way, public street, highway,
sidewalk or easement unless agreed to by the easement holder or
lot owner.
(3)
Every tower affixed to the ground shall be designed to discourage
climbing of the tower by unauthorized persons.
(4)
(5) Only one tower shall exist at any one time on any individual lot.
All ground-mounted communication towers shall be located to
create a collapse zone equal to the tower's height. Such collapse
zone shall be free of all buildings, except for those associated
with the commercial wireless telecommunication facility and those
located on the lot on which the tower is proposed to be located.
(6)
Communication towers shall be operated and maintained so as not
to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under
state law and the Township Code, except in emergency situations
requiring the use of a backup generator, where such noise
standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis only.
(7)
Tower setbacks. All towers shall conform to each of the following
minimum setback requirements:
Towers shall be set back from all lot lines and meet the setbacks
of the underlying zoning districts with at least as many feet as its
height, including top-mounted accessories.
(1)
A tower's setback may be reduced or its location in relation to a
public street varied, at the sole discretion of the Township Zoning
Hearing Board, only to allow the integration of a tower onto an
existing or proposed structure or building, such as a church
steeple, light standard, power line support device (e.g., power line
tower), or similar structure.
(2)
F.
§ 440-601 CHARTER § 440-601
C:989
Towers erected on any residential (amateur operators) lot shall be
set back a distance equal to 2/3 the height of the tower from all lot
lines.
(3)
Tower height. All proposed towers shall conform to each of the
following maximum height requirements.
The height of towers shall be determined by measuring the vertical
distance from the tower's lowest point of contact with the ground
to the highest point of the tower, including all antennas or other
attachments. When towers are mounted upon other structures, the
combined height of the structure and tower must meet the height
restrictions listed below.
(1)
Amateur radio towers on all residential properties shall have a
maximum height, including all antennas and other attachments, of
70 feet. Only one tower shall exist at any one time on any individual
lot.
(2)
In the Industrial (IN) Zoning District, the maximum height of any
tower not mounted on an existing building, including antennas and
other attachments, shall not exceed the following height:
Figure 600.3

(3)
G.
Tower lighting.
Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not
display strobe lights, except for aviation caution lights shielded
from sight from the ground, unless such lighting is specifically
required by the Federal Aviation Administration, local emergency
medical services or other federal or state authority for a specific
tower.
(1)
When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, and
when in accordance with all other appropriate portions of this
chapter, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or
similar areas may be attached to the tower.
(2)
H.
Signs and advertising. The use of any portion of a tower for signs, other
than warning or equipment information signs, is prohibited.
I.
§ 440-601 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-601
C:990
Accessory utility buildings. All utility buildings and structures
accessory to a tower and/or antenna shall be architecturally designed,
as determined by the approving authority, to be compatible with and
blend into the surrounding environment and shall meet the minimum
building setback requirements of the underlying zoning district.
J.
Annual registration and certification.
The owner of a tower shall file annually with the Zoning Officer
or his designee a declaration as to the continuing operation (with
active antennas) of each facility installed subject to these
regulations. Said declaration shall include:
(a) A listing of all tower users' names and mailing addresses; and
Any additional information deemed appropriate by the
Township.
(b)
(1)
Every three years, or within 60 days following a catastrophic act
of God or other emergency that affects the structural integrity of
the tower, a certification of continued structural integrity (i.e., a
statement that a thorough and complete inspection of the tower
was conducted and the tower and ancillary facilities are and will
continue to perform as originally designed), certified by a qualified
and Pennsylvania licensed professional engineer, shall also be filed
with the Township Manager or his designee.
(2)
Failure to timely file either the annual declaration or the
certification shall result in a presumption that the facility is
abandoned, unused, or unsafe, thus subject to removal.
(3)
K.
Abandoned, unused or unsafe towers.
The intent and purpose of this section is to address the compelling
public interest in ensuring that towers are promptly disassembled,
dismantled, and removed once they are no longer used. The
Township finds that there is substantial risk that towers may cease
being used in large numbers if there is a concentration or
consolidation of competitors within the industry or if even newer
technologies arise, obviating the need for towers.
(1)
Towers that are abandoned, unused for a period of three months or
deemed unsafe shall be removed as follows:
The Code Enforcement Officer may order that the commercial
wireless telecommunication towers be demolished and
removed based upon determining that the tower is unsafe or
abandoned in accordance with the provisions of the adopted
International Building Code and the Township local
amendments.
(a)
(2)
L.
§ 440-601 CHARTER § 440-601
C:991
In addition, the Township may recover its costs associated
with the demolition and removal of any such tower under the
performance guaranty required herein.
(b)
Antennas and towers mounted on roofs of existing buildings, and
antennas mounted on existing towers or poles.
The placement of commercial wireless telecommunication
antennas and cellular towers mounted on roofs of existing
buildings, and antennas mounted on existing towers or poles is
encouraged. Except when the Pennsylvania Wireless Broadband
Collocation Act applies, such requests may be approved
administratively by the Township Manager, provided that the
antenna or tower meets the requirements of this chapter, after
submittal of:
A lot plan and building plan in accordance with Township
requirements;
(a)
A report prepared by a qualified and Pennsylvania licensed
professional engineer indicating that the existing structure is
suitable to accept the antenna or tower, and the proposed
method of affixing the antenna or tower to the structure; and
(b)
A copy of an affidavit of lease stating the parties to the lease,
the term of the lease and the consent of the owner of the
existing building.
(c)
(1)
Such placements shall comply with the following requirements:
For facilities mounted on an existing building or tower, the
tower and antenna must be of a color that is identical to, or
closely compatible with, the color of the building or tower so as
to make them as visually unobtrusive as reasonably possible. In
addition, supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall
be screened from view or camouflaged.
(a)
No such commercial wireless telecommunication antennas or
towers, including the antenna's support structure, shall exceed
35 feet in height from the top of the building.
(b)
For any commercial wireless telecommunication antenna
mounted on an existing building or existing tower or pole, the
proposed antenna shall not substantially change the height of
such antenna's wireless support structure.
(c)
The diameter of roof-mounted dish antennas shall not exceed
21 feet, provided that no such antenna shall be visible from
front yard areas and the color, location and design shall blend
into and not detract from the character and appearance of the
building and surrounding properties.
(d)
(2)
M.
§ 440-601 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-601
C:992
The diameter of a tower-mounted dish antenna shall not
exceed 4 1/2 feet.
(e)
Timing of approval for application for applications that fall under
the Pennsylvania Wireless Broadband Collocation Act. Within 30
calendar days of the date that an application for a communication
antenna that falls under the WBCA is filed with the Township, the
Township shall notify the applicant in writing of any information
that may be required to complete such application. Within 60
calendar days of receipt of a complete application, the Township
shall make its final decision on whether to approve the application
and shall advise the applicant in writing of such decision.
(3)
Issuance of a building permit.
Prior to the issuance of a building permit, a performance
agreement, in a form suitable for recording in the Recorder's office
of Washington County, Pennsylvania, supported by a form of
guaranty shall be required for all commercial wireless
telecommunication facilities approved under this chapter. This
requirement shall not apply to facilities that fall under the
Pennsylvania Wireless Broadband Collocation Act. The
performance agreement and guaranty shall obligate the owner and
all subsequent owners to remove abandoned, unused or unsafe
towers, portions of towers, and facilities as detailed herein.
A cashier's check or letters of credit in a form acceptable
to the Township Solicitor are the desired forms of guaranty
acceptable to the Township. Other forms of security shall be
considered if deemed acceptable by the Township Solicitor.
The guaranty is designed to ensure the Township a fund for
demolition and removal of the tower and associated facilities
in the event the owner fails to discharge his obligations to
demolish and remove said tower and facilities.
(a)
The aggregate of all forms of guaranty posted on a project
should not exceed the total of the estimated cost of demolition
and removal, based on the Township's cost estimate, with
additional reasonable allowances for administrative costs,
inflation and potential damage to existing roads and utilities.
(b)
No performance agreement or guaranty shall be required for
Township-owned towers or towers or antennas located on a
Township-owned lot.
(c)
(1)
Before the issuance of a building permit, the following
supplemental information shall be submitted:
A copy of the Federal Aviation Administration response to the
submitted Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration, or its
replacement, shall be submitted to the Zoning Officer or his
designee;
(a)
(2)
N.
§ 440-601 CHARTER § 440-601
C:993
A report from a qualified and Pennsylvania licensed
professional engineer that demonstrates the tower's
compliance with the appropriate structural and electrical
standards.
(b)
Prior to receiving a final inspection by the Building, Zoning and
Code Enforcement Officers, documented certification shall be
submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, with a copy
to the Township Planning Department, certifying that the
telecommunication facility complies with all current applicable

O.
§ 440-601 CHARTER § 440-601
C:1043
Noise. The Township may require acoustical blankets, sound walls,
mufflers or other alternative methods as proposed by the operator
to ensure compliance depending on the location of a proposed drill
site to adjacent residential properties. As part of the conditional use
application and prior to beginning the drill operation, the applicant
shall establish the residual or background noise level baseline. The
baseline shall be established over a seventy-two-hour period with at
least one twenty-four-hour reading on a Saturday or Sunday. A noise
consultant/engineer mutually agreed upon by the Township and owner/
operator will be responsible for determining the residual background
noise level baseline. The applicant, owner/operator shall be responsible
for all costs associated with the noise consultant/engineer.
The noise generated during construction, drilling and hydraulic
fracturing activities when measured at the nearest protected
structure property line or 100 feet from the nearest protected
structure (as measured to the closest exterior point of the
building), whichever is closer to the protected structure, shall not
exceed the performance standard for noise set forth in
§ 440-601A(8). As to nonresidential and nonprotected structures,
the average ambient noise level as determined by the seventy-twohour
evaluation shall not exceed the following:
During drilling activities by more than 60 decibels or 10
decibels over the ambient, whichever is greater, during the
hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
(a)
During drilling activities by more than 60 decibels or five
decibels over the ambient, whichever is greater, during the
hours of 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
(b)
(1)
Since fluctuations in noise levels are inherent to mineral extraction
activities, the Township has created a sliding scale which provides
adjustments in the permitted level of noise generated during
operations to create flexibility in the regulations and prevent
repeated violations. Drilling activities are permitted to generate
noise 10 decibels higher than the average ambient noise levels
[Refer to Subsection P(1)(a), above.] and the adjustments are in
addition to that sound level. Adjustments to the preceding noise
limits may only occur during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
and are as follows:

NOTE: The maximum cumulative time that the permitted
increases in dBA may occur in one hour may not exceed 15
minutes. For instance, an operator shall not be permitted to allow
an increase of 10 dBA for five minutes and then an increase of five
dBA for 15 minutes, within the same hour. If 10 dBA are reached
for five minutes, then five dBA may only occur for 10 minutes.
Complaints.
If a complaint is received by any person using a protected
structure for a lawful purpose, within a reasonable vicinity
of a drill site, regarding noise generated during drilling and
hydraulic fracturing activities, the Township will conduct a
sound test to verify that a viable complaint exists. Upon
confirmation by the Township that a possible noise violation
exists, the operator shall, within 24 hours of the receipt of
the complaint from the Township, continuously monitor for a
forty-eight-hour period at a point which is the closer to the
complainant's building of:
The complainant's protected structure property line
nearest to the well site or equipment generating the noise;
or
[1]
One hundred feet from the protected structure, whichever
is closer.
[2]
(a)
If the operator engages in any noise testing as required by
this chapter, it will provide preliminary data to the Township
no later than 10 business days following completion of the
noise testing. Once the monitoring is complete, the operator
will meet with Township representatives and affected residents
to discuss whether possible noise abatement measures are
warranted if the permitted levels set herein were exceeded.
The Township reserves the right to hire a noise consultant
to do its own testing and investigation regarding the noise
complaint.

Part 7
Signage And Public Display
§ 440-700. Intent.
The sign regulations, controls and provisions set forth in this section are
intended to provide effective and compatible communication of information
in regard to public safety, location, streets and street addresses and basic
community identity. Specifically, Part 7, Signage and Public Display, is
intended to:
§ 440-701. Applicability.
Any sign erected, altered or maintained after the effective date of this
chapter shall conform to the following regulations.
§ 440-702. Illegal signs.
The Zoning Officer shall deem illegal any sign erected in the Township that
is not a permitted sign as defined in this section or is erected without a
necessary permit.
§ 440-703. Definitions.
All words used in this Part 7 shall carry their customary dictionary
definitions as provided in the most recent edition of Webster's Collegiate
Dictionary, except where specifically defined herein. For the purpose of this
Part 7, certain words shall have the meaning assigned to them as follows:
A. Ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed and maintained
so that public safety and traffic safety are not compromised.
B. Minimize the distractions and the obstructing of view that contributes
to traffic hazards and endangers public safety.
C. Encourage a high standard for signs in order that they should be
appropriate to and enhance the aesthetic appearance and
attractiveness of the community and, further, create an aesthetic
environment that contributes to the ability of the community to attract
sources of economic development and growth.
D. Allow for adequate and effective signs for communicating identification
while preventing signs from dominating the visual appearance of the
area in which they are located. In the interest of public safety, the
visibility of street address information for use by emergency responders
(fire, police and medical) is of preeminent importance.
E. Guide public safety, area development, preservation of lot values and
the general welfare of Peters Township.

(a) External.
[1] The source of the light must be concealed by translucent
covers and shall be a steady, stationary light source
shielded and directed solely at the sign. The light source

provision is to prohibit the use of a sign on a vehicle to
circumvent sign limits on a lot.
§ 440-710 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-710
C:1082
(2) All permanent freestanding signs shall be set back at least 16 feet
from the paved cartway of any street in all districts (unless

regulations.
(3) Whenever the ownership and the name of a business changes and
signs are modified in size, shape or location, the sign shall then be
brought into conformance with current regulations.
(4) A sign on a nonconforming use may be continued, but the size,
shape or location of such a sign shall not be modified.

shall not be enlarged or modified in any way.
(6) In the event that any nonconforming advertising sign, billboard,
nonresidential advertising structure or statuary is damaged by
casualty to the extent of 75% of its cost of replacement at the time
of destruction, or becomes dangerous, dilapidated or an imminent
hazard, such sign shall not be restored or replaced except in
conformity with the regulations of this chapter.
(7) Whenever any use of a building, structure or land ceases, all
nonconforming signs may be removed by the Township at the
expense of the owner or person in possession of the lot on which
said sign is located after official notification.
I. Liability. The provisions of this section shall not be construed as
relieving or limiting in any way the responsibility or liability of any
person, firm or corporation erecting or owning any sign, or resulting
from the negligence or willful acts of such person, firm or corporation,
its agents, employees or workmen, in the construction, maintenance,
repair or removal of any sign erected in accordance with a permit
§ 440-710 CHARTER § 440-710
C:1083
issued hereunder. Nor shall issuance of such permit be construed as
imposing on the Township or its officers or employees, any

integrity, construction methods, materials, electrical or mechanical
devices or other components which shall be the sole responsibility of
the person, firm or corporation erecting, owning, repairing or removing
such sign.

Part 8
Nonconformities
§ 440-800. Intent.
This purpose of this Part 8 is to set forth standards and regulations
regarding nonconforming uses, structures, and lots. These standards shall
apply to all nonconforming uses, structures and lots, as defined by this
chapter. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall
layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any development,
building, structure or part thereof for which official approval and required
permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this chapter or any
amendment thereto.
§ 440-801. Nonconforming lots of record.
In any district a dwelling or building and customary accessory buildings
may be erected on any single lot of record (deed) in existence at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, provided that all
district regulations are met except for lot area and width and provided that
the lot is not contiguous to other lots of record in the same ownership and
provided that the subdivision regulation requirements in effect at the time
of recording have been met.
§ 440-802. Nonconforming building setback lines.
§ 440-803. Nonconforming uses.
A. A nonconforming front yard setback line in the Low-Density Residential
District which has been duly recorded may be used without obtaining a
variance.
B. A single-family dwelling may be built upon a lot (either recorded or not
recorded) using the average of nonconforming front yard setbacks of
existing dwellings on all lots in the same block on the same side of the
street without a variance.
A. Where at the time of passage of this chapter or amendment thereto,
lawful use of land or buildings exists which could not be permitted by
the regulations imposed by this chapter, including parking
requirements, the specific use may be continued, provided that the use
is not abandoned.
B. At the effective date of the enactment or amendment of this chapter, a
lawful use of a lot or structure exists that is made no longer permissible
under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may
be sold or otherwise transferred to other owners and may be continued
as long as it remains otherwise lawful in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
§ 440-800 CHARTER § 440-803
C:1085
§ 440-804. Nonconforming structures.
C. When a nonconforming use of a structure and/or lot is discontinued or
abandoned for six consecutive months, the structure and/or lot shall not
thereafter be used, except in conformance with the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located, except that when the
discontinuance was beyond the control of the owner or tenant and was
without intent to abandon the use, the Zoning Hearing Board may, when
application is made not later than one year from the date the use was
discontinued, approve an extension of not more than one additional
year within which the use may be resumed. Additional extensions may
be approved at the Zoning Hearing Board's discretion.
D. From the time of such application to reinstitute or continue the use, the
landowner and/or developer shall have not more than one year to
complete the structure or reinstitute the use.
E. A nonconforming use may be expanded by 25% of the space occupied at
the effective date of this chapter with the approval of a special
exception by the Zoning Hearing Board, and subject to the criteria
established for special exceptions under this chapter, provided that the
expansion is shown not to be detrimental to the public health and safety,
and further provided that the nonconforming use has not previously
been expanded by as much as 25% within 10 years prior to the effective
date of this chapter. However, the use may not be expanded to a lot not
owned at the effective date of this chapter and may not create any new
nonconformities as to structures or lot requirements.
F. Where a structure principally devoted to a nonconforming use is
destroyed by casualty to the extent of 75% of the cost of construction at
the time of destruction of the bulk of its improvements or becomes so
dangerous or dilapidated that substantially complete reconstruction is
necessary, reconstruction for continuation of the nonconforming use
shall be denied.
G. No new nonconforming uses can be added to the premises. Only the
specific principal use in existence at the effective date of this chapter
has protected status.
H. A nonconforming accessory use cannot become the basis for a
nonconforming principal use.
I. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure may as a special exception be changed to another
nonconforming use, provided that the Zoning Hearing Board shall find
that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such
change, the Zoning Hearing Board shall require appropriate conditions
and safeguards in accordance with Parts 4 and 11. No such
nonconforming use granted by the Zoning Hearing Board shall be
considered a use by right.
§ 440-803 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-804
C:1086
A. Any building which is nonconforming as to lot coverage or is deficient in
parking may not be enlarged.
B. A single-family dwelling which has side yards less than that required
may be expanded to the rear or front, provided that such expansion
results in no further decrease in the side yards and the expansion will
comply with the rear or front yard and percentage of lot coverage
requirements of the district.
C. A single-family dwelling which has a front or rear yard less than that
required may be expanded to the side, provided that such expansion
results in no further decrease in the front or rear yards and the
expansion complies with the applicable side yard and percentage of lot
coverage requirements of the district.
D. A single-family dwelling which has side, front or rear yards less than
that required may be expanded vertically, provided that such expansion
will comply with applicable height requirements.
E. All buildings other than single-family dwellings which are
nonconforming by setbacks, height, etc., may be enlarged if a variance
is granted by the Zoning Hearing Board, provided that the
nonconformity is not increased and no new nonconformities are created
(unless a variance is granted), including lot and parking requirements,
and provided that the criteria in § 440-903 are met.
F. Should a nonconforming building or nonconforming portion of a
building be destroyed by casualty or become so dangerous or
dilapidated that replacement would represent 75% of the cost of
construction at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
G. Should a nonconforming building be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.
H. No other nonconforming structure shall be moved or enlarged unless it
is brought into conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
I. Nonconforming signs and signs for nonconforming uses are regulated

management insofar as the same relate to development not
involving the Subdivision Land Development Regulations.
(9) Disputes concerning zoning district boundaries. See Part 4.
A. Variance.
(1) The Township Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for
variances where it is alleged that the Zoning Ordinance's
provisions inflict unnecessary hardship upon the landowner and/or
developer, including variances to the Floodplain Regulations as per
Parts 8, 10 and 11. The Township Zoning Hearing Board shall
afford the Township Planning Commission the opportunity to make
a recommendation on any variance application affecting lot plan
review of a nonconforming nonresidential lot. By rule, the
Township Zoning Hearing Board may prescribe the form of
application and shall require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Township Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance,
provided that the following findings are made where relevant in a
given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular lot, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the lot is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the lot can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and
that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the lot.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant. Financial hardship shall not be construed as the
basis for granting a variance.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the lot is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent lots, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
§ 440-902 CHARTER § 440-903
C:1099
(2) In granting any variance, the Township Zoning Hearing Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and this chapter.
B. Special exception.
(1) Township Planning Commission. The Township Planning
Commission shall be afforded the opportunity to make a
recommendation to the Township Zoning Hearing Board on any
application for a special exception, on any variance request
involving a land development plan, or variance that pertains to the
change in use of a nonconforming lot, building or structure.
(2) Township Zoning Hearing Board.
(a) The Township Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests and
grant or deny the special exceptions specifically stated in Part
4.
(b) The Township Zoning Hearing Board shall determine its
decisions in accordance with the following standards and
criteria:
[1] Determine that the proposed special exception will not
substantially injure or detract from the use of neighboring
lots or from the character of the neighborhood and that
the use of lots adjacent to the area included in the
proposed change or plan is adequately safeguarded.
[2] Determine that the proposed special exception will serve
the best interests of Peters Township, the convenience of
the community, and the public welfare.
[3] Consider the effect of the proposed special exception upon
the logical efficient and economical extension of public
services and facilities, such as public water, sewers, police
and fire protection, and public schools.
[4] Impose such conditions, in addition to those required, as
are necessary to assure that the intent of this chapter is
complied with, which conditions may include, but are not
limited to, harmonious design of buildings, planting and its
maintenance as a sight or sound screen, the minimizing of
noxious, offensive or hazardous elements, adequate
standards of parking, and sanitation.
[5] Determine that the unique circumstances for which the
special exception is sought were neither created by the
owner of the lot, nor were due to or the result of general
conditions in the zoning district in which the lot is located.
§ 440-903 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-903
C:1100
[6] Consider the suitability of the proposed location of a use
with respect to probable effects upon highway traffic and
assure adequate access arrangements in order to protect
major streets and highways from undue congestion and
hazard.
[7] Ascertain the adequacy of sanitation and public safety
provisions, where applicable, and require a certificate of
adequacy of sewage and water facilities from a
governmental health agency in such case required herein
or deemed advisable.
[8] Financial hardship shall not be construed as the basis for
granting special exceptions.
[9] In granting a special exception, the Township Zoning
Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter
as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the
law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and this
chapter.
[10] In consideration of an application for special exception
(and conditional uses wherever these standards are
adopted by reference in this chapter), the landowner and/
or developer shall have the burden of proving that the
proposed use does not conflict with the general purposes
and intent of this chapter as determined both by the
standards and criteria enumerated herein, or any other
conditions which the Township Zoning Hearing Board
deems necessary to implement the purposes of the law of
this Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and this chapter.
(c) In hearing a request for a special exception, the Township
Zoning Hearing Board shall afford to the Township Planning
Commission the opportunity to make a recommendation on the
request.
(d) The Township Zoning Hearing Board shall exercise its
discretion in the decision on a special exception by stipulating
in its decision whether or not any further expansion of the use
is implied or limited.
(e) Effect of special exception approval. When an application for a
special exception has been filed with the Township Zoning
Hearing Board, and the subject matter of such application
would ultimately constitute either a land development or a
subdivision as defined in the Subdivision and Land
Development Regulations, no change or amendment of the
zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or plans shall
affect the decision on such application adversely to the
landowner and/or developer and the landowner and/or

Board following the date of such approval in accordance with
the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they
stood at the time the application was duly filed before the
Township Zoning Hearing Board. If either a land development
or subdivision plan is so filed within said period, such plan
shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 371, Stormwater
Management, and specifically to the time limitations which
shall commence as of the date of filing such land development
or subdivision plan.
(f) These provisions shall apply to any special exception
application filed on or after November 29, 2005. Previously
approved special exceptions shall be affected as follows: if no
preliminary plan has been filed, the landowner and/or
developer shall have six months from November 29, 2005, in
which to do so, and in that event, all provisions stipulated
above shall apply; if preliminary plans for the entire
development or any section thereof have been filed prior to
November 29, 2005, such special exception shall not be
affected by any change in municipal ordinances or plans
pertaining to zoning classification or density, or lot, building,
street or utility location, enacted subsequent to the filing of the
special exception application, provided that the special
exception approval did not contain a specific and express
provision to the contrary.

a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result

violation, unless the District Justice determining that there has
been a violation further determines that there was a good-faith
basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the

which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the District Justice, and thereafter each day that a

commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
E. Remedies/penalties provided by other statutes. In addition to any
remedies and penalties provided by the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code for a violation of the Peters Township Zoning Ordinance,
the Township may also seek remedies and penalties under the
applicable Pennsylvania statutes or regulations of any violation relating
to an erosion/sedimentation plan or permit (25 PA Code, Chapter 102)

A. Landowner curative amendment.
(1) A landowner and/or developer who desires to challenge on
substantive grounds the validity of a zoning ordinance or the
Official Zoning Map, or any provision thereof, which prohibits or

heard and decided as provided in the Municipalities Planning Code.
(2) The Township Council shall commence a hearing thereon within 60
days of the request. See § 440-912 for procedure.

§ 440-912. Validity of ordinance; substantive questions.
A. The owner/developer shall enter into an agreement with the Township
prior to the issuance of a building permit that those improvements not
completed within one year or those improvements not completed prior

A. A landowner and/or developer who, on substantive grounds, desires to
challenge the validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest shall submit the challenge either:
(1) To the Township Zoning Hearing Board under this section; or
(2) To the Township Council.

another by an ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desire to
challenge its validity on substantive grounds shall first submit their
challenge to the Township Zoning Hearing Board for a decision thereon
under this section.
C. The submissions referred to in Subsections A and B shall be governed
by the following:
(1) In challenges before the Township Zoning Hearing Board, the
challenging party shall make a written request to the Township
Zoning Hearing Board that it hold a hearing on its challenge. The
request shall contain the reasons for the challenge. Where the
landowner and/or developer desires to challenge the validity of
such ordinance and elects to proceed by curative amendment
§ 440-910 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-912
C:1108
under § 440-908, his application to the governing body shall
contain, in addition to the requirements of the written request
hereof, the plans and explanatory materials describing the use of
development proposed by the landowner and/or developer in lieu
of the use of development permitted by the challenged ordinance
or map. Such plans or other materials shall not be required to meet
the standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval
or for the issuance of a permit, so long as they provide reasonable
notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis
for evaluating the challenged ordinance or map in light thereof.
Nothing herein contained shall preclude the landowner and/or
developer from first seeking a final approval before submitting his
challenge.
(2) If the landowner and/or developer makes a submission to the
Township Council under § 440-908 the request also shall be
accompanied by an amendment or amendments to the ordinance
proposed by the landowner and/or developer to cure the alleged
defects therein.
(3) If the submission is made to the Township Council, the Township
Solicitor shall represent and advise Township Council at the
hearing or hearings referred to.
(4) The Township Council may retain an independent attorney to
present the defense of the challenged ordinance or map on its
behalf and to present its witnesses on its behalf.
(5) Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the
Township Council or the Township Zoning Hearing Board, as the
case may be, shall determine whether the challenged ordinance or
map is defective, as alleged by the landowner and/or developer. If a
challenge heard by the Township Council is found to have merit,
the Township Council shall proceed as provided in Section 609.1 of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.325 If a challenge
heard by the Township Zoning Hearing Board is found to have
merit, the decision of the Township Zoning Hearing Board shall
include recommended amendments to the challenged ordinance
that will cure the defects found. In reaching its decision, the
Township Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the amendments,
plans and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and/or
developer and shall also consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(b) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of
the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually

unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the
ordinance or map;
(c) The suitability of the lot for the intensity of use proposed by the
lot's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the lot's soils, slopes,
wetlands, woodlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and
any adverse environmental impacts; and
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(6) The Township Council or the Township Zoning Hearing Board, as
the case may be, shall render its decision within 45 days after the
conclusion of the last hearing.
(7) If the Township Council or the Township Zoning Hearing Board, as
the case may be, fails to act on the landowner and/or developer's
request within the time limits referred to above, a denial of the
request is deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close
of the hearing.
D. The Township Zoning Hearing Board or Township Council, as the case
may be, shall commence its hearings within 60 days after the request is
filed unless the landowner and/or developer requests or consents to an
extension of time.
E. Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of the
ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where and the
times when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory
material or proposed amendments may be examined by the public.
F. The challenge shall be denied when:
(1) The Township Zoning Hearing Board or Township Council, as the
case may be, fails to commence the hearing within the time limits
set forth in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(2) The Township Council notifies the landowner and/or developer that
it will not adopt the curative amendment.
(3) The Township Council adopts another curative amendment that is
unacceptable to the landowner and/or developer.

the last hearing on the request, unless the time is extended by the
mutual consent of the landowner and/or developer and Township.
G. Where, after the effective date of this chapter, a curative amendment
proposal is approved by the grant of a curative amendment application
by the Township Council pursuant to Section 909.1(b)(4) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code326 or the Township Zoning
Hearing Board sustains a validity challenge pursuant to Section
909.1(a)(1) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code327 or the
court acts finally on appeal from denial of a curative amendment
proposal or a validity challenge, and the proposal or challenge so
approved requires a further application for subdivision or land
development, the developer shall have two years from the date of such
approval to file an application for preliminary approval pursuant to
Chapter 385. Within the two-year period, no subsequent change or
amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or
plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights
of the landowner and/or developer as granted in the curative
amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Upon the filing of the
preliminary plan, the provisions in Chapter 371, Stormwater
Management, shall apply. Where the proposal appended to the curative
amendment application or the validity challenge is approved but does
not require further application under any subdivision or land
development ordinance, the developer shall have one year within which
to file for a building permit. Within the one-year period, no subsequent
change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely
affects the rights of the landowner and/or developer as granted in the
curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. During these
protected periods, the court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the
purpose of awarding such supplemental relief as may be necessary.
A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Township
Zoning Hearing Board later than 30 days after any application for
development, preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate
municipal officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to
secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such
person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge, or reason
to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has
succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the
knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other
than the landowner and/or developer to appeal from an adverse
decision by a Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of an
ordinance or map pursuant to § 440-912 and Section 916.2 of the
Municipalities Planning Code,328 shall preclude an appeal from a final

approval except in the case where the final submission substantially
deviates from the approved tentative or preliminary approval.
B. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner and/or
developer shall be filed by the landowner and/or developer within 30
days after notice of the determination is issued.
A. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section 913.3 of the
Municipalities Planning Code329 and during its pendency before the
Township Zoning Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any
agency or body, and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless
the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
the Township Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that such a stay
would cause imminent peril to life or lot. If such a cause is
demonstrated, the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order by the Township Zoning Hearing
Board or by the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County on
petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency
or body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has
been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Township Zoning Hearing Board by persons
other than the landowner and/or developer, the landowner and/or
developer may petition the Court of Common Pleas of Washington
County to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing
the proceedings before the Township Zoning Hearing Board.
B. After the petition is presented, the Court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous and is for the purpose of
delay. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of the
case. It shall be the burden of the landowner and/or developer for a
bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all evidence
presented, if the Court determines that the appeal is frivolous and is for
the purpose of delay, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The appellee
may waive the right to petition the Court to order the appellants to post
bond but such waiver may be revoked if an appeal is taken from the
final decision of the Court.
C. The question whether or not such a petition would be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
D. If a respondent takes an appeal to the petition for a bond from an order
of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and
the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a bond,

§ 440-913 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-914
C:1112
§ 440-915. Procedure to obtain preliminary opinion.
In order not to delay unreasonably the time when a landowner and/or
developer may secure assurance that the ordinance or map under which he
proposed to build is free from challenge, and recognizing that the procedure
for preliminary approval of his development may be too cumbersome or
may be unavailable, the landowner and/or developer may advance the date
from which time for any challenge to the ordinance or map will run under
§ 440-913 by the following procedure:
§ 440-916. Appeals.
the respondent to the petition for a bond shall be liable for all
reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner
upon motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals.
A. The landowner and/or developer may submit plans and other materials
describing his proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a
preliminary opinion as to their compliance with the applicable
ordinances and maps. Such plans and other materials shall not be
required to meet the standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or
final approval or for the issuance of a building permit so long as they
provide reasonable notice of the proposed use or development and a
sufficient basis for a preliminary opinion as to its compliance.
B. If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof shall
be published once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the Township. Such notice shall include a
general description of the proposed use or development and its
location, by some readily identifiable directive, and the place and times
where the plans and other materials may be examined by the public.
The favorable preliminary approval under § 440-913 and the time
therein specified for commencing a proceeding with the Township
Zoning Hearing Board shall run from the time when the second notice
thereof has been published.
A. Jurisdiction and venue on appeal; time for appeal. All appeals from all
land use decisions shall be taken to the Court of Common Pleas of the
judicial district wherein the land is located and shall be filed within 30
days after entry of the decision as provided in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5572
(relating to time of entry of order) or, in the case of a deemed decision,
within 30 days after the date upon which notice of said deemed decision
is given as set forth in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
B. Appeals to court; commencement; stay of proceedings.
(1) Land use appeals shall be entered as of course by the prothonotary
or clerk upon the filing of a land use appeal notice that concisely
sets forth the grounds on which the appellant relies. The appeal
§ 440-914 CHARTER § 440-916
C:1113
notice need not be verified. The land use appeal notice shall be
accompanied by a true copy thereof.
(2) Upon filing of a land use appeal, the prothonotary or clerk shall
forthwith, as of course, send to the governing body, board or
agency whose decision or action has been appealed, by registered
or certified mail, the copy of the land use appeal notice, together
with a writ of certiorari commanding said governing body, board or
agency, within 20 days after receipt thereof, to certify to the court
its entire record in the matter in which the land use appeal has
been taken, or a true and complete copy thereof, including any
transcript of testimony in existence and available to the governing
body, board or agency at the time it received the writ of certiorari.
(3) If the appellant is a person other than the landowner and/or
developer of the land directly involved in the decision or action
appealed from, the appellant, within seven days after the land use
appeal is filed, shall serve a true copy of the land use appeal notice
by mailing said notice to the landowner and/or developer or his
attorney at his last known address. For identification of such
landowner and/or developer, the appellant may rely upon the
record of the Township and, in the event of good faith mistakes as
to such identify, may make such service nunc pro tunc by leave of
court.
(4) The filing of an appeal in court under this section shall not stay the
action appealed from, but the appellants may petition the court
having jurisdiction of land use appeals for a stay. If the appellants
are persons who are seeking to prevent a use or development of the
land of another, whether or not a stay is sought by them, the
landowner and/or developer whose use or development is in
question may petition the court to order the appellants to post bond
as a condition to proceeding with the appeal. After the petition for
posting a bond is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the landowner and/or developers to prove the appeal is
frivolous. After consideration of all evidence presented, if the court
determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition
for posting a bond. The right to petition the court to order the
appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such
waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final
decision of the court. An order denying a petition for bond shall be
interlocutory. An order directing the respondent to the petition for
posting a bond to post a bond shall be interlocutory. If an appeal is
taken by a respondent to the petition for posting a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a land use appeal for refusal to post a
bond, such responding party, upon motion of petitioner and, after
hearing in the court having jurisdiction of land use appeals, shall be
§ 440-916 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-916
C:1114
liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred
by petitioner.
C. Intervention. Within the 30 days first following the filing of a land use
appeal, if the appeal is from a board or agency of the Township, the
Township and any landowner, developer or tenant of the lot directly
involved in the action appealed from may intervene as of course by
filing a notice of intervention, accompanied by proof of service of the
same, upon each appellant or each appellant's counsel of record. All
other intervention shall be governed by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil
Procedure.
D. Hearing and argument of land use appeal. If, upon motion, it is shown
that proper consideration of the land use appeal requires the
presentation of additional evidence, a judge of the court may hold a
hearing to receive additional evidence, may remand the case to the
body, agency or officer whose decision or order has been brought up for
review, or may refer the case to a referee to receive additional
evidence, provided that appeals brought before the court pursuant to
Section 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code330 shall
not be remanded for further hearings before any body, agency or officer
of the Township. If the record below includes findings of fact made by
the governing body, board or agency whose decision or action is
brought up for review and the court does not take additional evidence
or appoint a referee to take additional evidence, the findings of the
governing body, board or agency shall not be disturbed by the court if
supported by substantial evidence. If the record does not include
findings of fact or if additional evidence is taken by the court or by a
referee, the court shall make its own findings of fact based on the
record below as supplemented by the additional evidence, if any.
E. Judicial relief.
(1) In a land use appeal, the court shall have power to declare any
ordinance or map invalid and set aside or modify any action,
decision or order of the governing body, agency or officer of the
Township brought up on appeal.
(2) If the court finds that an ordinance or map, or a decision or order
thereunder, which has been brought up for review unlawfully
prevents or restricts a development or use which has been
described by the landowner and/or developer through plans and
other materials submitted to the governing body, agency or officer
of the Township whose action or failure to act is in question on the
appeal, it may order the described development or use approved as
to all elements or it may order it approved as to some elements and
refer other elements to the governing body, agency or officer
having jurisdiction thereof for further proceedings, including the

adoption of alternative restrictions, in accordance with the court's
opinion and order.
(3) Upon motion by any of the parties or upon motion by the court, the
judge of the court may hold a hearing or hearings to receive
additional evidence or employ experts to aid the court to frame an
appropriate order. If the court employs an expert, the report or
evidence of such expert shall be available to any party, and he shall
be subject to examination or cross-examination by any party. He
shall be paid reasonable compensation for his services that may be
assessed against any or all of the parties as determined by the
court. The court shall retain jurisdiction of the appeal during the
pendency of any such further proceedings and may, upon motion of
the landowner and/or developer, issue such supplementary orders
as it deems necessary to protect the rights of the landowner and/or
developer as declared in its opinion and order.
(4) The fact that the plans and other materials are not in a form or are
not accompanied by other submissions which are required for final
approval of the development or use in question or for the issuance
of permits shall not prevent the court from granting the definitive
relief authorized. The court may act upon preliminary or sketch
plans by framing its decree to take into account the need for
further submissions before final approval is granted.
A. Evaluation. The Township will evaluate the proposed development of
the proposed zoning in relationship to the potential development in the
existing zoning. The Township Planning Commission and Township
Council reserve the right to require additional information as part of
the review and approval processes in order to evaluate the applicability
of the rezoning.
B. Rezoning application requirements.
(1) To protect the safety, capacity and efficiency of the Township's
existing infrastructure systems; to maintain fiscal responsibility;
and to uphold the objectives of the Peters Township Comprehensive
Plan, all rezoning applications shall be required to prepare a series
of plans, analyses and reports to demonstrate the compatibility of
the rezoning proposal.
(2) All rezoning applications shall be completed on the official forms
provided by the Planning Director. Each plan, analysis and report

a hearing with the Township Zoning Hearing Board before the
Township Planning Commission reviews any site plans.
(4) If a special exception is required, the developer shall submit a site
plan to the Township Planning Commission prior to a hearing with
the Township Zoning Hearing Board. In such instance, the
Commission shall not render a decision on the plan, but shall
submit its opinions to the Township Zoning Hearing Board in
writing. The plan submitted need not meet all of the specifications
outlined in this chapter but shall be a certified survey of the lot
showing a reasonable presentation of the proposed use.

classification of use shall be as defined in Part 3 (Definitions), or the
definitions within the district regulations; or as described as having
a different parking requirement in § 440-507, Off-street parking
and loading. Referral to the Township Planning Commission by the
Zoning Officer shall be in accordance with Part 9.
(6) Conditional approval.
(a) Site plans given conditional approval may be signed by the
Chairman after receiving referred approvals and noting
corrections, provided that such action, together with noted
approvals, shall be publicly recorded at the next regularly
scheduled monthly meeting.
(b) Site plans and supplemental materials for conditional uses
shall be forwarded to the Township Council for its approval.
The Township Council may approve the plan, disapprove the
plan, or give tentative approval contingent upon requested
changes citing the sections of the ordinance(s) or conditional
use decision relied on for the conditions.
(7) When the application requires submission of a stormwater
management plan in accordance with Township ordinances (See

§ 440-1005. Application for site plan review: conditional use.
A. Filing of request. The landowner and/or developer shall request in
writing consideration for a conditional use at a regularly scheduled
meeting of the Township Council.
(1) The request shall be accompanied by plans and other materials
describing the use or development proposed. Such plans and other
materials shall not be required to meet the standards prescribed
for preliminary or final approval or for the issuance of permits so
long as they provide an accurate notice of the proposed use or
development and a sufficient basis for evaluating the request being
made, including impacts on surrounding properties and traffic
impacts on affected streets prepared by professionals in
accordance with Township guidelines. See § 440-510.
(2) Seventeen copies of the written request and other materials must
be filed 10 days in advance of the Township Council meeting and
shall be distributed by the Township concurrently to the Township
Planning Commission for review and recommendations.
B. Hearing.
(1) The Township Council shall acknowledge the receipt of the request
at its next public meeting and shall set a date for a public hearing
pursuant to public notice within 45 days. Written notice shall be
sent to all landowners whose lots are subject of the hearing and to
all landowners whose lots are within 600 feet of the subject lot. If
the landowner is presenting a curative amendment along with his
request for a conditional use, the procedure outlined in § 440-908
shall prevail but the applications may be advertised and heard
concurrently.
(2) If the landowner and/or developer is requesting a change in the
zoning district classification to accommodate a conditional use, the
procedure outlined in § 440-917 shall prevail but the applications
for rezoning and conditional use shall be advertised and heard
concurrently. At the hearing, the Township Council shall review the
submitted plans and other materials, note for the record the
recommendations of the Township Planning Commission, allow
comments from the floor, and question the landowner and/or
developer using the standards and criteria for special exceptions in
this chapter.
(3) All references herein to the Township Zoning Hearing Board shall,
for purposes of this section, be references to the Township Council.
C. Decision.
(1) The Township Council shall render a written decision within 30
days from the conclusion of the hearing, allowing or denying the
conditional use. In denying the use, conclusions based on any
§ 440-1005 CHARTER § 440-1005
C:1129
provisions of any ordinance, rule or regulations shall contain a
reference to the provisions relied on and the reasons why the
conclusion is deemed appropriate. In allowing a conditional use,
the Township Council may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the ordinance, as
it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the
Municipalities Planning Code and the Zoning Ordinance.
(2) If approval for the conditional use is given, the landowner and/or
developer shall not claim any approval of the plans or other
materials submitted; nor shall any approval of plans or other
materials be implied by the Township Council in its approval of the
use.
D. Effect of conditional use approval.
(1) When an application for a conditional use has been filed with the
Township Council and the subject matter of such application would
ultimately constitute either a "land development" or a "subdivision"
as defined in the Subdivision and Land Development Regulations,
no change or amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other
governing ordinance or plans shall affect the decision on such
application adversely to the landowner and/or developer, and the
landowner and/or developer shall be entitled to a decision in
accordance with the provisions of the governing ordinances or
plans as they stood at the time the application was duly filed;
provided, further, that should such an application be approved by
the Township Council, the landowner and/or developer shall be
entitled to proceed with the submission of either land development
or subdivision plans within a period of six months or longer as may
be approved by the Township Council following the date of such
approval in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was
duly filed before the Township Council. If either a land development
or subdivision plan is so filed within said period, such plan shall be
subject to the provisions of § 385-9 of the Subdivision and Land
Development Regulations, and specifically to the time limitations
which shall commence as of the date of filing such land
development or subdivision plan.
(2) These provisions shall apply to any conditional use application filed
on or after August 9, 1982. Previously approved conditional uses
shall be affected as follows: if no preliminary plan has been filed,
the landowner and/or developer shall have six months from August
9, 1982, in which to do so, and in that event, all provisions
stipulated above shall apply; if preliminary plans for the entire
development or any section thereof have been filed prior to August
9, 1982, such conditional use shall not be affected by any change in
municipal ordinances or plans pertaining to zoning classification or
density, or lot, building, street or utility location, enacted
subsequent to the filing of the conditional use application, provided
§ 440-1005 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-1005
C:1130
§ 440-1006. Site plan review: conditional use.
The Township Council, with recommendations from the Township Planning
Commission and the Township Engineer, shall review the final lot plans
and associated drawings for conditional uses. In addition, the Township
Council shall have the final decision as to the propriety and adequacy of the
maintenance plan and/or guaranties proposed for all buildings, permanent
improvements, stormwater management controls and common areas. The
Township Council shall approve the maintenance plans and/or agreements.
§ 440-1007. Plan review: change in use, nonresidential districts.
§ 440-1008. Occupancy permits.
that the conditional use approval did not contain a specific and
express provision to the contrary.
A. If a lot plan is already on file with the Township for the land and/or
building which meets the standards in this chapter, a supplemental lot
plan can be submitted indicating any improvements required by this
chapter due to the type of use, occupancy capacity, parking and loading,
or other requirements of this chapter.
B. If no lot plan is on file for the building and/or land, one must be
submitted which complies with § 440-1003. Both require Township
Planning Commission review and approval.
C. If the lot plan on file meets the requirements of this chapter and the
change in use can be accommodated without any lot alterations, the
Zoning Officer shall make a record of compliance when reviewing the
building permit.
A. When required.
(1) Occupancy permits issued by the Building Official are required
under the following circumstances:
(a) Prior to occupancy of any new structure or portion of a
structure for which a building permit has been issued;
(b) Prior to the occupancy of an existing commercial or industrial
structure by a new use or tenant; and/or
(c) Prior to any change in use or additional type of use of a
structure or land other than the business or use as currently
operated under the existing occupancy permit. The use of
previously unoccupied land constitutes a change in use. The
commencement of a home occupation also constitutes a
change in use.
§ 440-1005 CHARTER § 440-1008
C:1131
(2) Occupancy permits for a new use within an existing structure or for
a use not specified on the building permit application require the
signature of the Zoning Officer.
B. Application for occupancy permits.
(1) Upon the completion of the erection or alteration of any building or
portion thereof, or the moving of any building, the owner or person
acting for the owner shall notify the Building Official of such
completion and comply with the requirements of § 440-910 with
regard to lot improvement guaranties. As-built surveys will be
required for all new single-family construction.
(2) Prior to the occupancy of an existing structure by a new tenant or
lessee, and prior to any change in use or additional type of use of a
structure or land, the owner or person acting for the owner shall
notify the Zoning Officer in writing of the intention to occupy, or
change, or add to the use and comply with § 440-1007.
C. Issuances of occupancy permits.
(1) All occupancy permits shall be granted or denied by the Building
Official within 10 days after the date of application unless the
landowner and/or developer is required to comply with § 440-1004.
All occupancy permits for new commercial or industrial
construction exclusive of tenant space require the signature of the
Fire Marshal.
(2) Temporary occupancy permits.
(a) Under the following conditions a temporary occupancy permit
may be authorized and/or granted:
[1] In hardship cases where the occupancy of the building is
shown to be essential and such occupancy will not cause
harm to the health and welfare of the occupants. In the
commercial and industrial districts, no business shall be
conducted under such a permit. Said structure shall be
open to the inspection of the Building Official and Fire
Marshal for the authorization of a final occupancy permit.
Such a temporary permit shall become invalid in 30 days.
[2] All occupancy permits granted in the commercial and
industrial districts shall be classified as temporary if
necessary for 30 days after the facility is fully operating,

Part 11
Floodplain Controls
§ 440-1100. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,335 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Peters Township does hereby order
as follows.
§ 440-1101. Purpose and intent.
In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, the purpose of
these controls is to protect areas of the floodplain subject to and necessary
for floodwaters; to permit and encourage the retention of open land uses
which will be so located and designed as to constitute a harmonious and
appropriate part of the physical development of the municipality as
provided for in the Comprehensive Plan; and to continue Peters Township's
continued eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. In advancing
these principles and the general purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and
Comprehensive Plan, the specific intent of these controls is to:
A. Combine with present zoning requirements, certain restrictions made
necessary for the floodplains to promote the general health, welfare
and safety of the community;
B. Prevent the erection of structures in areas unfit for human usage by
reason of danger from flooding, unsanitary conditions or other hazard;
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting the water supply and
promoting safe and sanitary drainage;
D. Reduce the financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units and its individuals by frequent and periodic floods
and overflow of lands;
E. Permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in the floodplain
as herein defined and which will not impede the flow of floodwaters, or
otherwise cause danger to life and property at, above, or below their
locations along the floodway;
F. Permit only those uses in the floodplain compatible with the
preservation of natural conditions which are conducive to the
maintenance of constant rates of water flow throughout the year by:
withholding rapid water runoff contributing to downstream flooding;
and providing area for groundwater absorption for maintenance of the
subsurface water supply; and

§ 440-1103. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter the more restrictive shall apply.

B. The areas considered to be flood-prone within Peters Township are
those areas identified as floodplain areas as well as any area adjacent or
near to a watercourse having a drainage area of 100 acres or more.
C. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by Peters Township and declared to be
a part of this chapter.
D. Current Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are available for
inspection at the Township offices. For the purpose of these controls the
following nomenclature is used in referring to the various kinds of
flood-prone areas in the FIRM and FIS issued by the FEMA:
(1) Zone A: the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the onepercent
annual chance floodplains that are determined in the FIS
report by approximate methods. Because detailed hydraulic
analyses are not performed for such areas, no base (one-percent
annual chance) flood elevations (BFEs) or depths are shown within
this zone.
(2) Zone AE: the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the onepercent
annual chance floodplains that are determined in the FIS
report by detailed methods. Whole foot BFEs derived from the
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals within
this zone.
A. To determine the one-hundred-year flood elevation for these areas, the
elevation at a given point on the boundary of the identified flood-prone
area(s) which is nearest the construction site in question will be used.
In helping to make this necessary elevation determination, other
sources of data where available shall be used, such as:
(1) Corps of Engineers: floodplain information reports.
(2) United States Geological Survey: flood-prone quadrangles.
(3) United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation
Service: county soil surveys.
(4) Known high-water marks from past floods.
(5) Other sources.
B. In lieu of the above, the Township shall require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,

C:1147
§ 440-1108. Changes in identification of flood-prone areas.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
of Peters Township where studies or information provided by a qualified
agency or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to
any such change, approval must be obtained from the FEMA. Additionally,
as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify the FEMA of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 440-1109. Disputes.
Should a dispute arise concerning the identification of any flood-prone area,
an initial determination shall be made by the Building Inspector or Zoning
Officer, and any aggrieved by such decision may appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 440-1110. Permitted land uses.
In the identified flood-prone area(s), the development and/or use of any land
shall be permitted, provided that the development and/or use adheres to the
restrictions and requirements of all other applicable codes and ordinances
in force in Peters Township and shall be limited to the following (listed in
general order of appropriateness):
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the Township.
A. Wildlife sanctuary, woodland preserve, arboretum.
B. Game farm, fish hatchery (excluding rearing structures), hunting and
fishing reserves.
C. Forestry, lumbering and reforestation excluding storage and mill
structures. (See Chapter 402.)
D. Harvesting of any wild crops, such as marsh hay, ferns, moss, berries or
wild rice.
E. Outdoor plant nursery; orchard.
F. Pasture; grazing land.
G. Recreation use, such as: park, day camp, picnic grove, golf course,
hunting, fishing and boating club, excluding structures. The parking of
recreational vehicles within the floodplain shall be allowed, provided
that they are elevated and anchored or on the site for less than 180
consecutive days. All recreational vehicles parked within the floodplain
must be fully licensed and highway ready.
H. Outlet installations for sewage treatment plants, sealed public water
supply wells.

subdivision, or substantial improvement to an existing
manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision.
A. Within any identified floodplain area, no new construction,
development, use, activity, or encroachment of any kind shall be
allowed, unless the minimum standards listed below are met.
B. The following minimum standards shall apply for all construction
proposed to be undertaken within any identified flood-prone area.
(1) Grading. No grading or filling in the floodplain area shall be
permitted which would cause a rise in the one-hundred-year flood
height at any point on adjacent properties or cause a rise in the
§ 440-1110 CHARTER § 440-1112
C:1149
§ 440-1113. Existing structures.
After review by the Peters Township Planning Commission (for everything
other than a single-family residence) and other appropriate officials as may
be deemed necessary by the Building Inspector and Zoning Officer, any
building within the floodplain constructed prior to the original enactment
one-hundred-year flood height of more than one foot at any point on
the subject property. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses regarding
flood height must be performed by a registered professional
engineer and be performed in accordance with standard and
accepted engineering practice. Following grading, any earth shall
be compacted to provide the necessary permeability and resistance
to erosion, scouring, or settling, and the area promptly seeded.
(2) Stream encroachment. See § 440-1117.
(3) Sanitary sewer facilities. All new or replacement sanitary sewer
facilities, and private package sewage treatment plants (including
all pumping stations and collector systems) shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into the floodwaters. In addition,
they should be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage and impairment.
(4) Water facilities. All new or replacement water facilities shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into
the system, and be located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damages.
(5) Utilities. All utilities, such as gas lines, electrical and telephone
systems, being placed in identified flood-prone areas should be
located, elevated (where possible) and constructed to minimize the
chance of impairment during a flood.
(6) Outdoor storage. No materials that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or in times of flooding could be injurious to human,
animal or plant life shall be stored below the regulatory flood
elevation.
(7) Structures:
(a) Structures will be anchored to prevent floatation, collapse, or
lateral movement;
(b) Building materials are flood-resistant;
(c) Appropriate practices that minimize flood damage have been
used; and
(d) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities have been designed and
located to prevent water entry or accumulation.
§ 440-1112 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-1113
C:1150
of these controls (November 1, 1979) may be altered or extended provided
that:
§ 440-1114. Plan review.
All plans for development or use within the floodplain, with the exception
of expansion of existing single-family dwellings, shall be subject to the
approval of the Peters Township Planning Commission.
§ 440-1115. Municipal liability.
§ 440-1116. Variances.
In addition to the standards set forth in § 440.903 for the granting of
variances, the following shall apply if a variance is requested in a floodprone
area:
A. Any construction within any floodplain, the lowest floor (including
basement) of any new or improved structures shall be at least 1 1/2 feet
above the one-hundred-year flood elevation, or if a nonresidential
structure, be flood-proofed in accordance with § 440-1011. Following
construction, documentation of the as-built floor elevation of any
building alteration or extension shall be provided to the Peters
Township Zoning Officer by way of a FEMA elevation certificate or
other acceptable means.
B. The alteration or extension conforms to all applicable regulations of this
chapter.
C. Any increase in volume or area shall not exceed an aggregate of more
than 25% of such volume or area during the life of the structure; and
D. No increase in any on-lot sewer system presently located either wholly
or partially in the floodplain shall be required.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. The granting of a zoning permit of any kind in any floodplain district
shall not constitute a representation, guaranty or warranty of any kind
by the Township, or by an official or employee thereof, of the
practicability or safety of any structure, use or other plan proposed, and
shall create no liability upon, or a cause of action against such public
body, official or employee for any damage that may result pursuant
thereto.
§ 440-1113 CHARTER § 440-1116
C:1151
A. No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use or
activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the
one-hundred-year flood elevation.
B. No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any special flood hazard area that would, together with
all other existing and anticipated development, increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point on the subject property or
cause a rise in the one-hundred-year flood height at any point on an
adjacent property.
C. All applications for a variance shall include plans of all proposed
buildings, structures and other improvements, drawn at suitable scale,
showing the proposed lowest floor elevation of any proposed building
based upon North American Vertical Datum of 1988 and the elevation of
the base flood.
D. In reviewing any request for a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider that the granting of the variance will not result in an
unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood heights, additional threats
to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on, or victimization of the public, or conflict with any other
applicable local or state ordinance and regulations.
E. Whenever a variance is granted for any construction within any
floodplain, the lowest floor (including basement) of any new or
improved structures shall be at least 1 1/2 feet above the one-hundredyear
flood elevation, or, if a nonresidential structure, be flood-proofed in
accordance with this chapter. Following construction, documentation of
the as-built floor elevation of any building alteration or extension shall
be provided to the Peters Township Zoning Officer by way of a FEMA
elevation certificate or other acceptable means.
F. Structures involving production or storage of dangerous materials and
substances. In accordance with the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act and the regulations adopted by the Department of
Community and Economic Development as required by the Act, any new
or substantially improved structure which will be used for the
production or storage of any of the following dangerous materials or
substances; or will be used for any activity requiring the maintenance
of a supply of more than 550 gallons, or other comparable volume, of
any of the following dangerous materials or substances on the
premises; or will involve the production, storage, or use of any amount
of radioactive substances; shall be subject to the provisions of
Subsection F in addition to all other applicable provisions. The
following materials and substances are considered dangerous to human
life:
(1) Acetone.
(2) Ammonia.

otherwise regulated.
G. Within any identified floodplain area, any new or substantially improved
structure of the kind described in Subsection F above shall be
prohibited within the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-ofbank
of any watercourse.
H. Within any floodway area, any structure of the kind described in
Subsection F above, shall be prohibited. Where granted by variance
within any identified floodplain area, any new or substantially improved
residential structure of the kind described in Subsection F above, shall
be elevated to remain completely dry up to at least 1 1/2 feet above
base flood elevation.
I. Where granted by variance within any identified floodplain area, any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure of the kind
described in Subsection F above, shall be:
(1) Elevated, or designed and constructed to remain completely dry up
to at least 1 1/2 feet above base flood elevation; and
(2) Designed to prevent pollution from the structure or activity during
the course of a base flood.
§ 440-1116 CHARTER § 440-1116
C:1153
§ 440-1117. Storm drainage.
J. Any such structure, or part thereof, that will be built below the
regulatory flood elevation shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the standards for completely dry floodproofing
contained in the publication "Flood-Proofing Regulations" (United
States Army Corps of Engineers, June 1972, as amended March 1992),
or with some other equivalent watertight standard.
K. Whenever a variance is granted, that the Zoning Hearing Board shall
notify the applicant in writing that the granting of the variance may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance and that such
variances may increase the risks to life and property.
A. Purpose. Each lot in all zoning districts shall provide safe management
of stormwater runoff consistent with the standards and criteria of the
Peters Township Stormwater Management Ordinance336 and the
requirements contained in this section.
B. Stream encroachment of natural watercourses.
(1) Any stopping up, filling up, confining, paving, filling next to,
changing of embankments or any other interference with or change
of the course of any drain, ditch, stream, or watercourse must be
preceded by application for plan review and a permit from the
Zoning Officer and conducted in accordance with this chapter and
applicable state and federal statutes.
(2) Any encroachment into a regulatory floodway which would cause
any increase in the base flood elevation is prohibited. Hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard and
accepted engineering practice must be submitted by the applicant
to demonstrate that the proposed encroachment will not increase
base flood elevations during the base flood discharge.
(3) No encroachment, alteration or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the Township,
and until all required permits or approvals have been first obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection.
(4) The Township Engineer shall be notified 48 hours in advance of the
commencement of the work in order that provision may be made
for proper inspection thereof. Samples of materials and every
reasonable facility for ascertaining whether the work is in
conformity with this chapter shall be furnished to the employees of
the Township in the same manner as is required of contractors
under the terms of the state highway specifications.
336. Editor's Note: See Ch. 371, Stormwater Management.
§ 440-1116 PETERS TOWNSHIP CODE § 440-1117
C:1154
(5) In addition, the Federal Insurance Administrator and Pennsylvania
Department of Community and Economic Development shall be
notified by the Township prior to any alteration or relocation of any
watercourse.
C. Stormwater management requirements.
(1) All uses or lots in all zoning districts shall comply with the
standards of the Peters Township Stormwater Management
Ordinance.
(2) It shall be unlawful for a property owner to divert and/or
concentrate stormwater drainage from the surface, roof drains,
French drains or impervious area (driveways, sidewalks, tennis
courts, sport court, etc.) onto an adjacent property other than into
a natural watercourse, channel, storm drainage easement or public
storm sewer system. If it is not possible to discharge or direct
stormwater runoff to a natural watercourse, channel, storm
drainage easement or public storm sewer system, the property
owner shall manage stormwater runoff so as not to create a
concentrated flow or create erosion or water damage on an
adjacent property.
(3) All sites, lots, or properties shall be graded to provide positive
drainage away from structures. All sites, lots or properties shall
provide drainage facilities including swales to adequately handle
surface runoff and convey it to the nearest suitable outlet, such as
curbed street, natural watercourse, channel or storm sewer
system. Where drainage swales are used to divert surface runoff,
the swale shall be stabilized with appropriate lining to ensure than
no accelerated erosion occurs. If it is not possible to discharge or
direct stormwater runoff to a natural watercourse, channel, storm
drainage easement or public storm sewer system, the property
owner shall manage stormwater runoff so as not to create a
concentrated flow or create erosion or water damage on an
adjacent property.
