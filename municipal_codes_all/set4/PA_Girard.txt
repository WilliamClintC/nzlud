(4) A cost-of-living increase would not impair the actuarial soundness
of the pension plan.
D. Unused employee pension contributions will be provided to the estate
of the retired officer upon death of both the officer and his/her spouse.
This does not include accrued interest which remains with the pension
system and only includes employee contributions.
E. Service-related disability benefit. [Amended 5-19-2003 by Ord. No.
681]
(1) Act 305 establishes a monthly service-related disability benefit of
no less than 50% of the officer's salary at the time disability was
incurred, provided that any member who receives benefits for the
same injuries under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.)
shall have his disability benefits offset or reduced by the amount of
such benefits. This benefit is not applicable retroactively to officers
who have already been honorably discharged with a serviceconnected
disability benefit which is less than 50%.
(2) Under Act 30, pensions for families of members killed in the line of
service are fixed at 100% of the officer's salary, based on the final
average (last 36 months) salary at the time of death. In addition,

§ 44-6. Widow benefits. [Amended 9-15-1997 by Ord. No. 661]
§ 44-7. Dependent children benefits. [Added 5-19-2003 by Ord. No.
681]
Under Act 30,7 after the death of a surviving spouse, an officer's surviving
child or children can receive the fifty-percent-or-greater benefit until age
18 or, if attending college, until the age of 23. Act 30 defines "attending
college" as being enrolled in an institution of higher learning and carrying
a minimum course load of seven credits per semester. This benefit may also
be granted to currently surviving dependent child(ren) if the police officer
parent died prior to the effective date of the Act.
§ 44-8. Vesting. [Amended 7-16-1984 by Ord. No. 542]
this amendment is not available retroactively for the family of an
officer who was killed in the line of duty.
A. In the event of death of a member who was receiving a pension or
disability benefit or who had qualified for a retirement or pension
benefit but had not retired, his widow shall be entitled to receive a
pension equal to 50% of the pension the member was receiving or
would have been receiving had he been retired at the time of his death.
The entitlement of the widow shall terminate upon her death or
remarriage.
B. Act 306 sets a minimum survivor benefit of no less than 50% of the
pension which the member was receiving or would have received had
he been retired at the time of his death. Act 30 eliminates the marriage
penalty in that a surviving spouse who remarries does not lose the
survivor benefit; it continues on until the death of the surviving spouse.
The amendment expressly states that benefits currently granted to
surviving spouses whose police officer spouse died on or before the
effective date of the Act and who were not remarried as of April 17,
2002, may receive an increased survivor benefit. [Added 5-19-2003
by Ord. No. 681]
A. Girard Borough shall be the owner of all monies or property paid into
the fund or annuities or policies purchased from insurance companies
hereunder and the owner and designated beneficiary of any insurance
and retirement income contracts acquired hereunder.
B. Any participant who, before completing superannuation retirement age
and service requirements but after having completed 12 years of total
service, for any reason, ceases to be employed as a full-time police
officer shall be entitled to vest his retirement benefits by filing with the
Council, within 90 days of the date he ceases to be a full-time police
officer, a written notice of his intention to vest. Upon reaching the date

§ 44-9. Prior pension assets and benefits.
All contracts, agreements or funds held for the purpose of providing
pension, annuities or retirement income, or any of them, on any policeman
who shall be a participant in the program herein established shall be and
hereby are transferred and assigned to the fund herein created. After
such transfer, the police pension fund shall assume the liability, if any,
of continuing the payment of pensions to members of the police force
retired prior to such transfer in accordance with the laws and regulations
under which such members where retired. Any pension payments to any
participant under the Girard Borough Non-Uniform Employees Pension Plan
shall be offset against the pension payable to such participant under the
Police Pension Plan.
§ 44-10. Administration.
The police pension fund herein provided for shall be administered by
trustees under a pension trust agreement exhibited and hereby
incorporated by reference. To said trustees shall be paid all sums received
from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on account of tax on premiums
of foreign casualty insurance companies or other state funds for police
which would have been his superannuation retirement date if he had
continued to be employed as a full-time police officer, he shall be
paid a partial superannuation retirement allowance, determined by
applying the percentage his years of service bears to the years of
service which he would have rendered had he continued to work until
his superannuation retirement date to the gross pension, using,
however, the monthly average salary during the appropriate period
prior to his termination of employment.
C. Each participant who has not qualified for vesting, or who has not
elected to vest his benefits as provided under Subsection B of this
section, shall be entitled in the event of termination or discontinuance
of his employment for reasons other than retirement or death to have
returned to him the total amount of all such monies paid by him into the
pension fund, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. If such
termination or discontinuance of employment is due to death, such
refund of money shall be paid to the participant's designated
beneficiary or, in the absence thereof, to his estate.
D. Under Act 30,8 if an officer dies prior to vesting his/her pension, the
surviving spouse or, if the spouse is deceased, any child or children
under the age of 18, or age 23 if attending college, is entitled to 100% of
the officer's contributions, together with any interest thereon, unless
the officer has designated another beneficiary. This benefit is not
available for survivors of an officer who died prior to April 17, 2002.

pensions, all payments which may be made from time to time by police
officers, all sums which may be contributed by the Borough and all other
amounts which may lawfully form a part of such a trust.
§ 44-11. Execution of trust agreement.
Authority is hereby conferred upon the Mayor and Secretary to enter into
and execute on behalf of the Borough of Girard the pension trust agreement
exhibited and hereby incorporated by reference. Council is further
authorized to provide for the payment to the trustees of such monies
from the general funds of the Borough as may be necessary to carry
out the purposes of the trust in the event that monies received from the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and other sources are insufficient.
§ 44-12. Military leave. [Added 5-19-2003 by Ord. No. 681]
Any employee who is a member of a retirement system at the time he is
granted a military leave of absence is entitled to exercise any one of the
following options:
A. An employee can continue to make regular payments into the pension
fund during the period of his military leave of absence. The amount of
such payments shall be the same as they would have been had the
employee not been granted military leave of absence, but had instead
remained actively employed. The time of making such payment must be
mutually agreed upon by the employee and the pension fund of which
he is a member, but in no event may be less frequent than semiannually.
The employer must make its contributions on the same basis as is used
to compute the employee's contributions. In this case, his retirement
rights must be determined on the basis that he was in the active,
continuous, and uninterrupted employ of his employer for the period
during which he was on military leave of absence.
B. The employee may discontinue making payments into the fund during
the period of his military leave of absence. In such event, the employer
must also discontinue making its contributions during this period. In
this case, retirement rights must be determined by completely
disregarding the period of his military leave of absence for all purposes.
C. In exercising the first option (Subsection A of this section), the
employee must, within 60 days of commencing military service, notify
the Borough Manager of his or her desire to do so. Any employee who
does not exercise the first option (Subsection A) will be deemed to have
exercised the second option (Subsection B of this section).
D. Any employee who has exercised the second option (Subsection B) but
who, upon the expiration of his military leave of absence, resumes
employment and desires to receive the benefits of the first option
(Subsection A) shall have the right to receive such benefits if he:
§ 44-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 44-12
1:23
(1) Gives written notice to the Borough Manager, within six months
after he returns to his employment, of his desire to receive the
benefits of the first option (Subsection A); or
(2) Pays into the retirement fund an amount equal to the total
payments he would have made had he exercised the first option
(Subsection A).
E. Act 6009 further provides that police officers employed for at least six
months with the Police Department must be given credit for pension
purposes for time spent on military leave if he or she returns to the
Department within six months after the end of such service.
(1) Act 600, which applies to municipal police officers only, predates
the Pennsylvania Military Code,10 which applies to all Pennsylvania
public and private employers.
(2) Although there is no case law directly on point, presumably Act 600
does not exempt police officers from requirements of the Military
Code that pension contributions be made in order for military leave
time to be counted toward years of service for pension calculation
purposes.

RECORDS, OPEN
§ 63-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to assure compliance with Act 3 of 2008,
the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. § 67.101 et seq., as amended;
to provide access to public records of Girard Borough; to preserve the
integrity of Girard Borough's records; and to minimize the financial impact
to the residents of the Borough regarding the resources utilized in the
receipt and processing of public record requests and the retrieval and
copying of public records.
§ 63-2. Open Records Officer; procedures.
It is the policy of the Borough to require the presence of a designated
employee when public records are examined and inspected and to charge
reasonable fees for duplication of public records of the Borough. Girard
Borough designates the Borough Manager as the Open Records Officer,
responsible for assuring compliance with the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know
Law, in accordance with the following guidelines:
A. The Borough Manager may designate certain office staff employee(s) to
process public record requests.
B. The Borough Manager is responsible for minimizing, where possible,
the financial impact to the Borough regarding the resources utilized in
§ 54-1 GIRARD CODE § 63-2
1:26
the receipt and processing of public record requests and the retrieval
and copying of public records.
C. All requests for public records of the Borough under this policy shall be
specific in identifying and describing each public record requested. In
no case shall the Borough be required to create a public record which
does not exist or to compile, maintain, format or organize a public
record in a manner in which the Borough does not currently compile,
maintain, format or organize the public record. All requests for public
records shall be submitted in writing and include the date of the
request; requestor's name, address, and telephone number;
certification of United States residency; signature of requestor; and, if
duplication is requested, appropriate payment.
D. The Open Records Officer employee shall make a good faith effort to
determine whether each record requested is a public record.
E. The Borough shall facilitate a reasonable response to a request for
Girard Borough's public records. In no case is the Borough expected to
provide extraordinary staff to respond to the request, but will respond
in a manner consistent with the Borough's administrative
responsibilities and consistent with the requirements of the
Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law.
F. The Open Records Officer shall respond to the requester within five
business days from the date of receipt of the written request. If the
Borough does not respond within five business days of receipt thereof,
the request is deemed denied, subject to Subsection K hereafter in the
event of a review.
G. The response provided by the Borough shall consist of approval for
access to the public record; review of the request; or denial of access to
the record requested.
H. If access to the public record requested is approved, the public record
shall be available for access during the regular business hours of the
Borough. The Open Records Officer shall cooperate fully with the
requester, while also taking reasonable measures to protect Borough
public records from the possibility of theft and/or modification. The
presence of a designated office staff employee is required when public
records are examined and inspected.
I. Fees for duplication of public records shall be as established by the
Commonwealth Office of Open Records. The Borough may, at its
discretion, waive fees.
J. In the event the estimated cost of fulfilling a request submitted under
this policy is expected to exceed $100, the Open Records Officer shall
obtain from the requester the expected cost in advance of fulfilling the
request to avoid unwarranted expense of Borough resources.
K. Review of requests.
§ 63-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 63-2
1:27
(1) If the request is being reviewed, the notice provided by the
Borough shall be in writing and include the reason for the review
and the expected response date, which shall be within 30 days of
the notice of review. If the Borough does not respond within 30
days thereof, the request is deemed denied. Review of the request
is limited to situations where:
(a) The record requested contains information which is subject to
access, as well as information which is not subject to access
that must be redacted prior to a grant of access. The redacted
information is considered a denial as to that information;
(b) The record requires retrieval from a remote location;
(c) A timely response cannot be accomplished due to staffing
limitations;
(d) A legal review is necessary to determine whether the record
requested is a public record;
(e) The requester has failed to comply with the Borough's policy
and procedure requirements;
(f) The requester refuses to pay the applicable fees; or
(g) The extent or nature of the request precludes a response
within the required time period.
(2) Upon a determination that one of the factors listed above applies,
the Borough shall send written notice to the requester within five
business days of receipt of the request for access. The notice shall
include a statement notifying the requester that the request for
access is being reviewed, the reason for the review, a reasonable
date that a response is expected to be provided and an estimate of
applicable fees owed when the record becomes available. If the
date that a response is expected to be provided is in excess of 30
days, following the five business days allowed for, the request for
access shall be deemed denied unless the requester has agreed in
writing to an extension to the date specified in the notice. If the
requester agrees to the extension, the request shall be deemed
denied on the day following the date specified in the notice if the
agency has not provided a response by that date.
L. If access to the record requested is denied, the notice provided by the
Borough shall be in writing as indicated on the form attached hereto
entitled "Denial of Request to Review and/or Duplicate Girard Borough
Records."13
M. If the request is denied or deemed denied, the requester may file an
appeal with the Commonwealth Office of Open Records within 15

the request.
N. Within 30 days of the mailing date of the final determination of the
appeals officer, the requester or Borough may file a petition for review
or other document as required by rule of court with the Court of

heights of constructed structures and objects of natural growth; creates
appropriate zones, establishing the boundaries thereof and providing for
changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones; creates the
permitting process for use within said zones; and provides for enforcement,
assessment of violation penalties, an appeals process, and judicial review.
§ 105-2. Effect on other zone districts.

§ 105-6. Variances.
submitting PENNDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of
the proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof. The
Department's BOA response must be included with this permit
application for it to be considered complete. If the Department's BOA
returns a determination of no penetration of airspace, the permit
request should be considered in compliance with the intent of this
chapter. If the Department's BOA returns a determination of a
penetration of airspace, the permit shall be denied, and the project
sponsor may seek a variance from such regulations as outlined in
§ 105-6.
B. No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace
parts of existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height
of an existing structure.
A. Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance
with 14 CFR Part 77, Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-1, as amended or
replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a variance will depend
on the determinations made by the FAA and the Department's BOA as to
the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. In particular, the
request for a variance shall consider which of the following categories
the FAA has placed the proposed construction in:
(1) No objection. The subject construction is determined not to exceed
obstruction standards, and marking/lighting is not required to
mitigate potential hazard. Under this determination, a variance
shall be granted.
(2) Conditional determination. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport
hazard area which can be effectively mitigated. Under this
determination, a variance shall be granted contingent upon
implementation of mitigating measures as described in § 105-9,
Obstruction marking and lighting.
(3) Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined
to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be denied,
and the reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the
applicant.
B. Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that
a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the
public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this
chapter.
§ 105-5 GIRARD CODE § 105-7
1:38
§ 105-7. Use restrictions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use shall be made
of land or water within the Airport District Overlay in such a manner
as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, impair visibility in the
vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the
airport.
§ 105-8. Preexisting nonconforming uses.
The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or
tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this
chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming
use. No nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to
grow higher so as to increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming use,
once substantially abated (subject to Chapter 425, Zoning), may only be
reestablished consistent with the provisions herein.
§ 105-9. Obstruction marking and lighting.
Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
may be conditioned according to the process described in § 105-6 to require
the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit
the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person requesting
the permit or variance, to install, operate, and maintain such marking or
lighting as deemed necessary to assure both ground and air safety.
§ 105-10. Violations and penalties.
Subject to that in Chapter 425, Zoning.
§ 105-11. Appeals.
Subject to the process in Chapter 425, Zoning.
§ 105-12. Conflicting regulations.
Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this chapter and any other regulation applicable to the same
area, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.

A. Violence in our community committed by and against minors is a cause
of great concern for the immediate health, safety and general welfare of
our citizens. The Borough highly values the health, safety and general
welfare of our minors and has a vested interest in preserving and
nurturing them as a valuable asset and investment in Girard's future.
Persons under the age of 18 are vulnerable to be pressured to
participate in violent unlawful activities and to be victims of
perpetrators of violent crimes due to their general lack of maturity and
experience. Minors who are present in public places during the late
night and early morning hours are particularly vulnerable to being
victimized and abused. The Borough needs effective tools available to
protect minors from the dangers that exist in the late night and early
morning hours at public places.
B. The Council of the Borough of Girard, recognizing the problem of
crimes committed by and committed against minors during the late
night and early morning hours and believing that it can be dealt with
more effectively by regulating the hours during which minors may
remain in public places and certain establishments without adult
supervision, and by defining more clearly certain duties and
responsibilities upon those who have custody and responsibility for the
care of such minors, hereby enacts this chapter with the intent of
promoting the general welfare and protecting the general public
through the reduction of juvenile violence and crime within the
Borough of Girard, promoting the safety and welfare of the Borough's
minors whose youth and inexperience renders them particularly
vulnerable to becoming participants in criminal activity and victims of
perpetrators of crime, and fostering and strengthening parental
responsibility for children.

other authorized employee of the municipality shall be guilty of an
offense and, upon conviction, shall pay a fine to the Borough of not less

B. Determination of the regulatory flood elevation. For purposes of this
chapter, the regulatory flood elevation, i.e., the one-hundred-year-flood
elevation, plus a freeboard safety factor of 1 1/2 feet, shall be used. To
determine the one-hundred-year-flood elevation, the elevation at a

Chapter 250
MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS
§ 250-1. Findings; purpose.
The people and citizens of the Borough of Girard, acting by and through
their duly elected governing body, this Council, are aware that the practice
of body massage under certain circumstances can scientifically promote
physical well-being by relieving and relaxing muscle tension, stimulating
vascular circulation which enhances the disposition of waste products
generated by muscular exercise and assisting in the development of muscle
tone though a form of passive exercise. It is further recognized that the
physical contact involved in such practice can provide a source of
communication of disease for which the health and safety of the community
requires local government control and supervision. This Council further
recognizes that various businesses operating under the guise of practicing
body massage, sometimes called "massage parlors," are intended to
stimulate sexual and erotic reactions, which this Council believes is
contrary to the morals and welfare of this Borough. In addition to regulating
the legitimate and bona fide practice of massage, this Council intends
to prohibit and prevent the abuse of said practice for sexual and erotic
stimulation purposes.

D. The provisions of this article do not prohibit the present or future
discharge of stormwater runoff to storm sewers or to natural
watercourses within the Borough's service area.
A. The economy and desirability of the combined treatment of industrial
wastes and sanitary sewage is recognized. In general, any and all
industrial wastes may be discharged to the public sanitary sewage
system, except those which are deemed harmful to the system or are
specifically prohibited by this article. However, it is also recognized that
the treatment of abnormal industrial wastes may add to the cost of
operating and maintaining the public sanitary sewage system. Such
additional cost must therefore be borne by the person or persons
receiving the benefit of such treatment.
B. The Borough reserves the right to refuse connection to the public
sanitary sewage system for deleterious industrial wastes or to compel
discontinuance of the use of the system for such wastes or to require
pretreatment and/or equalization to flow thereof in order to prevent
harmful or adverse effects upon the system. The design, construction
and operation of such pretreatment and/or flow equalization facilities
shall be made at the sole expense of the person discharging said wastes
and shall be subject to the approval of Council or its designated
representative.
§ 320-2 GIRARD CODE § 320-4
1:164
§ 320-5. Prohibited discharges.
C. In general, industrial waste shall be considered harmful to the public
sanitary sewage system if it may cause any of the following damaging
effects:
(1) Chemical reaction, either directly or indirectly, with the materials
of construction or the public sanitary sewage system in such a
manner as to impair the strength of durability of any sewerage
structures.
(2) Mechanical action that will damage any sewerage structures.
(3) Restriction of the hydraulic capacity of any sewerage structures.
(4) Restriction of the normal inspection or maintenance of any
sewerage structures.
(5) Danger to public health and safety.
(6) Obnoxious conditions inimical to the public interest.
D. When required by Council, any person discharging to the public
sanitary sewage system any industrial wastes, or industrial wastes and
sanitary sewage together, shall install a suitable manhole or manholes
or metering chamber on his connecting sewer or sewers to facilitate
observation, sampling and measurement of the combined flow or
wastes from his premises. Such manhole or manholes or metering
chamber shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed
in accordance with plans approved by Council or its designated
representative. The manhole or manholes or metering chamber shall be
installed by such person at his expense and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible to Council or its designated
representative at all times. The construction and maintenance of such
manhole or metering chamber shall be mandatory for the producers of
abnormal industrial wastes, and, if deemed necessary by Council, flows
from such manhole or metering chamber shall be continuously
monitored, transmitted and recorded by means of an approved
receiving device to be located at the treatment plant.
A. The discharge of excessive amounts of unpolluted water or waste to a
sanitary sewer is expressly prohibited. However, such discharges to
storm sewers will be permitted wherever such sewers are of adequate
capacity. The Council reserves the right to define the amount it deems
excessive in each particular instance.
B. The discharge of garbage to the public sanitary sewage system is
expressly prohibited, unless the garbage is first properly shredded.
C. No sanitary sewage or industrial waste from any property other than
that for which a permit has been issued as provided in § 320-9 hereof
shall be discharged to the public sanitary sewage system.
§ 320-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 320-5
1:165
D. No person shall discharge to the public sanitary sewage system any
sanitary sewage or industrial wastes having any of the following
characteristics:
(1) Wastes containing liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their
nature or quality, may cause fire, explosions, or be in any other way
injurious to persons, the structures of the public sanitary sewage
system or its operation.
(2) Wastes having a temperature in excess of 150° F. or less than 32°
F.
(3) Wastes having a pH lower than 6.0 or higher than 9.0 or having any
corrosive properties capable of causing damage or hazards to
structures, equipment or personnel of the public sanitary sewage
system. Where the Council deems it advisable, it may require any
person discharging industrial wastes to install and maintain, at his
own expense, in a manner approved by Council or its designated
representative, a suitable device to continuously measure and
record the pH of the wastes so discharged.
(4) Wastes containing any noxious or malodorous gas or substance
which, either singly or by interaction with sewage or other wastes,
is, in the opinion of Council, likely to create a public nuisance or
hazard to life or prevent entry to sewerage structures for their
maintenance and repair.
(5) Wastes containing ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings,
metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, hair, chemical or
paint residues, greases, lime slurry or viscous materials of such
character or in such quantity that, in the opinion of Council, they
may cause an obstruction to the flow in the sewers or otherwise
interfere with the proper operations of the public sanitary sewage
system. Attention is called to the fact that the maximum
permissible concentration will vary throughout the public sanitary
sewage system depending upon the size of the particular sewer
receiving the same and the flows therein.
(6) Wastes containing insoluble, nonflocculent substances having a
specific gravity in excess of 2.65.
(7) Wastes containing soluble substances in such concentration as to
cause the specific gravity of the waste to be greater than 1.1.

interfere with the biochemical processes of the sewage treatment
works or that will pass through the treatment process and still
exceed the state and federal requirements for the receiving stream.
(13)Wastes containing radioactive material without a special permit.
A. There is imposed upon the owners of or the users of water in or on all
properties served by the public sanitary sewage system sewage
collection, transportation and treatment charges for the use of said
system, payable in the amounts and as provided in the Sewer Rate
Resolution and as it is hereinafter from time to time adopted, amended,
and modified by Council. Said owners and users will be jointly and
severally liable for the payment of said sewage collection,
transportation and treatment charges and the penalties therein
prescribed for delinquent payments thereof.
B. All bills for sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges
shall be due when rendered and shall be subject to the penalty
provisions set forth in the Borough's Sewer Rate Resolution. Owners
and, where adequate arrangements have been made with Council,
§ 320-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 320-6
1:167
users will be billed periodically for the sewage collection,
transportation and treatment charges in accordance with the billing
practices of the Borough.
C. The Borough's current sewage collection, transportation and treatment
charges are based upon water usage. The Council may, if it deems it
advisable, elect at some time in the future to impose, in whole or in
part, the sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges on
such other basis as it may determine. When water usage is used as the
basis for said charges, the volume of water to be used for billing
purposes shall be based upon water meter readings by the Borough or
its designated representative. In the absence of such readings, charges
shall be based upon estimates made by the Borough or flat rate
charges.
D. When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then if any owner or
user obtains part or all of the water used in or on a property from
sources other than the Borough, such owner or user shall be charged on
the flat-rate basis, in accordance with the Borough's Sewer Rate
Resolution.
E. When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then, if it is
established to the satisfaction of the Council that a portion of the water
used in or on any property served by the public sanitary sewage system
does not and cannot enter said system, and in the event that the total
water used in or on said property exceeds 100,000 gallons per quarter,
Council may determine, in such manner and by such method as it may
deem practical, the percentage of the water entering the public
sanitary sewage system, or Council may require or permit the
installation of additional meters in such manner as to determine either
the quantity of water excluded from the public sanitary sewage system
or the quantity of water, sewage or industrial waste actually entering
the public sanitary sewage system, exclusive of stormwater runoff. In
such case, the sewage collection, transportation and treatment charge
shall be based upon the quantity of water estimated, measured or
computed by Council to be actually entering the public sanitary sewage
system, exclusive of stormwater runoff, since stormwater runoff is
prohibited from entering into a sanitary sewer.
F. When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then any person
requesting consideration for a reduction of the amount of the sewage
collection, transportation and treatment charges because of water not
entering the public sanitary sewage system shall make written
application to Council for such consideration, giving the name of such
person, his address and setting forth supporting data fully describing
other sources of water, if any, as well as the disposition of water alleged
not to be entering the public sanitary sewage system. The application
shall be accompanied by a sketch, to approximate scale, showing the
plan of the property, the water distribution system, sewer layout,
existing meters, and proposed meters in the scheme to determine the
quantity of flow entering, or not entering, the public sanitary sewage

1:168
§ 320-7. Surcharge for certain industrial wastes.
system. The cost of furnishing, installing and maintaining any meters
other than those utilized to measure water purchased from the Borough
shall be borne by the applicant. The type, size, location, arrangement
and maintenance of such meters shall be subject to the approval of the
Council.
A. Although the sewage treatment works will be capable of treating
certain abnormal industrial wastes as heretofore defined in § 320-1, the
actual treatment of such wastes may increase the cost of operating and
maintaining the public sanitary sewage system. Therefore, there will be
imposed upon each person discharging such industrial waste into the
public sanitary sewage system a surcharge, or surcharges, which is
intended to cover such additional cost. Such surcharges shall be in
addition to the regular sewage collection, transportation and treatment
charges set forth in the Sewer Rate Resolution of the Borough and shall
be payable as therein provided.
B. The strength of any industrial waste, the discharge of which is to be
subject to surcharge, shall be determined monthly, or more frequently
as the Council shall determine, from samples taken either at the
manhole or metering chamber referred to in § 320-4D hereof or at any
other sampling point mutually agreed upon by Council and the
producer of such waste. The frequency and duration of the sampling
period shall be such as, in the opinion of Council, will permit a
reasonably reliable determination of the average composition of such
waste, exclusive of stormwater runoff. Samples shall be collected or
their collection supervised by a representative of Council and shall be in
proportion to the flow of waste, exclusive of stormwater runoff, and
composited for analysis in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,"
cited above. Except as hereinafter provided, the strength of the waste
so found by analysis shall be used for establishing the surcharge or
surcharges. However, Council may, if it so elects, accept the results of
routine sampling and analyses by the producer of such wastes in lieu of
making its own samplings and analyses.
C. BOD surcharge rate.
(1) In the event any industrial waste is found by Council to have a BOD
in excess of 300 milligrams per liter, the producer of said waste
shall be surcharged an amount equal to the product of the actual
volume of wastes in thousand gallons per billing period, exclusive
of stormwater runoff, discharged to the public sanitary sewage
system and the BOD surcharge rate. The BOD surcharge rate shall
be determined by the following formula:
§ 320-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 320-7
1:169
Rc = 0.00834 P (C-300)
Where:
Rc = the BOD surcharge rate in cents per 1,000 gallons of
waste discharged.
P = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance
cost of secondary treatment processes per pound of
BOD received at the treatment works.
C = the average BOD of the industrial waste expressed in
milligrams per liter as determined in accordance with
Subsection B of this section.
(2) The figure 300 appearing in the above formula corresponds to the
maximum BOD permissible without surcharge. The figure 0.00834
is the factor to convert milligrams per liter to pound per 1,000
gallons. No discount will be permitted for sewage or industrial
wastes having a BOD less than 300 milligrams per liter.

average suspended solids concentration in excess of 350
milligrams per liter, the producer of such waste shall be surcharged
an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in
thousand gallons per billing period, exclusive of stormwater runoff,
discharged to the public sanitary sewage system and the
suspended solids surcharge rate. The suspended solids surcharge
rate shall be determined by the following formula:
Rs = 0.00834 x B (S-350)
Where:
Rs = the suspended solids surcharge rate in cents per 1,000
gallons of waste discharged.
B = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance
cost of the sludge digestion, sludge drying and sludge
disposal operations per pound of suspended solids
received at the treatment works.
S = the average suspended solids concentration of the
abnormal industrial waste expressed in milligrams per
liter as determined in accordance with Subsection B of
this section.
(2) The figure 350 appearing in the above formula corresponds to the
maximum suspended solids concentration permissible without
surcharge. The figure 0.00834 is the factor to convert milligrams
per liter to pounds per 1,000 gallons. No discount will be permitted
for sewage or industrial wastes having a suspended solids
concentration less than 350 milligrams per liter.

residential contractor or other registered hauling contractor for service
in collection and disposal of such materials.61
I. It shall be the responsibility of the residential contractor to bill and
collect from each household contracting for its services amounts due
for services rendered by the contractor in performance of the contract,
subject further to the following:
(1) In the event the residential contractor is not paid the quarterly fee
per household assessed for all-inclusive service, is not paid sums
due by residents electing the per-bag service method or is not paid
special service fees due for additional services requested by the
customer, the contractor may proceed to collect such sums in a civil
action against the resident, householder, customer or other
responsible party for such dwelling.
(2) In no event shall Girard Borough be responsible for payment of any
sum due with regard to services rendered by the contractor under
the contract.
J. Miscellaneous provisions.
(1) Should a residential customer place recyclable materials for
collection in such manner that they are not cleaned and/or sourceseparated
from municipal waste or other materials as required by
this chapter and, as presented, are contaminated, the contractor
may decline to collect the same if the contractor gives to the
customer notice of the deficiency and reasons.
(2) Residential customers shall cut, bend or otherwise reduce to a
length not exceeding six feet fence boards, guttering, Christmas
trees, shrubbery, limbs, branches and other materials presented for
collection by the contractor as municipal waste.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 360-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Girard Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 360-2. Findings.
The governing body of Girard Borough finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood-reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint
source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of Girard Borough and all the people of
the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
§ 360-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-2
1:217
§ 360-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Girard Borough, Erie County, by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in § 360-2 of this chapter through provisions intended to:
§ 360-4. Statutory authority.
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim,
and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems
close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum
of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards, and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all stormwater
management facilities and best management practices (BMPs) that are
constructed and implemented.
J. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.

provisions of this chapter that are causing such undue hardship, and
state the minimum waiver or relief that is necessary. The applicant shall
state how the proposal in the applicant's waiver request provides equal
or better results in meeting the purpose and requirements of this
chapter.
D. Girard Borough shall keep a written record of all actions on waiver
requests in the project file.
E. Girard Borough may charge applicants fees for waiver requests
sufficient to cover all costs incurred by the Girard Borough to process
the requests.
F. In processing waiver requests, Girard Borough may impose reasonable
conditions that will, in its sole judgment, resolve the undue hardship
while meeting the purpose and requirements of this chapter.
G. Girard Borough may grant requests for waivers when the following
findings are made by the municipality, when each is determined solely
by Girard Borough to be applicable and relevant:
(1) That the waiver shall result in an equal or better means of
complying with the purpose and requirements of this chapter.
§ 360-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-13
1:239
§ 360-14. Volume controls.
(2) That the waiver is the minimum necessary to provide relief from
undue hardship.
(3) That the applicant is not requesting a waiver based solely on cost
considerations.
(4) That existing downgradient stormwater problems will not be
exacerbated by the proposed waiver request.
(5) That runoff is not being diverted to a different drainage area in a
manner that may cause hardship to others.
(6) That increased flooding or ponding on off-site properties or
roadways will not be caused by the waiver request.
(7) That potential icing conditions will not be caused by the waiver
request.
(8) That increased or unusual municipal maintenance expenses will
not result from the waiver request.
(9) That operation and maintenance requirements are not reduced by
the waiver request.
A. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual
and in Appendix B73 of this chapter shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the applicant
may select either method on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures
associated with each methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for
all storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour
storm.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
73.Editor's Note: Appendix B is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 360-13 GIRARD CODE § 360-14
1:240
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases, at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration
tests shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual.
A minimum forty-eight-hour notification to Girard Borough
shall be provided to allow witnessing of the testing.
(3) In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltrationbased
best management practices to partially fulfill the
requirements in either § 360-14B(1) or (2), the following procedure
shall be provided to allow witnessing of the testing:
(a) At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided
to justify the decision to reduce the use of infiltration BMPs:
[1] Description of and justification for field infiltration/
permeability testing with respect to the type of test and
test locations.
[2] An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and
their structure as these relate to the interaction between
soils and water. In addition to providing soil and soil profile
descriptions, this narrative shall identify depth to seasonal
high-water tables and depth to bedrock, and provide a
§ 360-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-14
1:241
§ 360-15. Rate controls.
description of all subsurface elements (fragipans and other
restrictive layers, geology, etc.) that influence the
direction and rate of subsurface water movement.
[3] A qualitative assessment of the site's contribution to
annual aquifer recharge shall be made, along with
identification of any restrictions or limitations associated
with the use of engineered infiltration facilities.
[4] The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by
a professional engineer or geologist.
[5] A professional opinion stating that the proposed
groundwater recharge is consistent with natural recharge,
is reasonable, and is consistent with this chapter.
(b) The following water quality pollutant load reductions will be
required for all disturbed areas within the proposed
development:
Pollutant Load Units
Required
Reduction

Total suspended solids
(TSS)
Pounds 85%
Total phosphorous (TP) Pounds 85%
Total nitrate (NO3) Pounds 50%
(c) The performance criteria for water quality best management
practices shall be determined from the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, most current
version.
C. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.
A. Lands contained within Erie County that have not had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year storms.
B. Lands contained within Erie County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan:
(1) The post-development peak discharge rates shall be in accordance
with the approved release rate map for the following watersheds:
(See appendixes for Release Rate Map.74)

§ 360-16. Sensitive areas; stormwater hotspots.
(a) Lake Erie watersheds.
A. Sensitive areas and water quality sensitive developments, as defined
below, which require special consideration with regard to stormwater
management.
(1) "Sensitive areas" are defined as those areas that, if developed, have
the potential to endanger a water supply. These areas consist of the
delineated one-year zone of contribution and direct upslope areas
tributary to the water supply wells. Girard Borough may update the
sensitive area boundaries based on new research or studies as
required.
(2) "Stormwater hotspots" are defined as a land use that generates
higher concentrations of hydrocarbons, trace metals, or toxicants
than are found in typical stormwater runoff. As such, they have a
high potential to endanger local water quality, and could potentially
threaten groundwater reservoirs. Girard Borough will determine
what constitutes these classifications on a case-by-case basis. The
PADEP wellhead protection contaminant source list shall be used
as a guide in these determinations. Industrial manufacturing site
and hazardous material storage areas must provide NAICS codes.
B. Performance standards.
(1) The location of the boundaries of sensitive areas is set by drainage
areas tributary to any public water supply. The exact location of
these boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be
determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines the
limits of the sensitive area. If the project site is within the sensitive
area (in whole or in part), two-foot contour interval mapping shall
be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area. If the project
site is adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive
area, a five-foot contour interval map defining the limits of the
sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management
plan to document the site's location relative to the sensitive area.
(2) Applicants for projects involving stormwater hotspots may be
required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution
prevention plan and file notice of intent as required under the
provisions of the EPA Industrial Stormwater NPDES Permit
Requirements.
(3) Drainage from stormwater hotspots must use an acceptable
pretreatment BMP prior to volume control and/or rate control
BMPs. Acceptable pretreatment BMPs for these developments
74.Editor's Note: Said appendixes are on file in the Borough offices.
§ 360-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-16
1:243
include those based on filtering, settling, or chemical reaction
processes such as coagulation.
(4) Projects involving stormwater hotspots and development in
sensitive areas must include riparian buffers as defined in § 360-10.

System Permitting, Monitoring and Compliance.
§ 360-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-17
1:245
E. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed
include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall be protected from receiving sediment-laden
runoff.
(3) The source of protection for infiltration BMPs shall be identified
(i.e., orange construction fence surrounding the perimeter of the

ARTICLE V
Design Criteria
§ 360-18. Stormwater management and drainage facilities.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless the watersheds are subwatersheds of a common
watershed which join together within the perimeter of the
property; the effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate
discharge onto adjacent lands; or easements from the affected
landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow-type condition.
(3) Innovative stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are
encouraged (e.g., rooftop storage, dry wells, cisterns, recreation
area ponding, diversion structures, porous pavements, holding
tanks, infiltration systems, in-line storage in storm sewers, and
grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and constructed
in accordance with the latest technical guidance published by
PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed engineering
plans and performance capabilities and supporting site-specific
soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to
verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from other sources
may be accepted at the discretion of Girard Borough. (A
preapplication meeting is suggested.)
(4) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(5) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. Girard
Borough shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the continuation or exacerbation of a documented
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
(6) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses, including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Consultation with Girard Borough and prior approval are
§ 360-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-18
1:247
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
(a) Multiple-use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
(7) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105,76 the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
B. Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a municipal or state roadway
without approval from Girard Borough or PennDOT.
(2) The top, or toe, of any slope of stormwater management facilities
shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from any property line.
(3) The minimum horizontal distance between any stormwater holding
facility and a building/structure shall be 25 feet. The lowest floor
elevation of any structure constructed immediately adjacent to a
detention basin or other stormwater facility shall be a minimum of
two feet above the one-hundred-year water surface elevation.
(4) Stormwater management facility bottom (or surface of permanent
pool) elevations must be greater than adjacent floodplain
elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS analysis). If no floodplain is defined,
bottom elevations must be greater than existing ground elevations
50 feet from top of stream bank in the facility's vicinity.
(5) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the one-hundred-yearfloodplain
elevation must be used for all design storms, or the
applicant may elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent
watercourse for each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be
50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a floodway is not
designated or no other evidence is provided.
(6) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table.
The invert of stormwater facilities may be lowered if adequate
76.Editor's Note: See 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
§ 360-18 GIRARD CODE § 360-18
1:248
subsurface drainage is provided. Flows from underdrains need not
be accounted for in volume or rate control calculations.
(7) Whenever possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Vertical side slopes and
rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(8) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed 3:1 and may be
further reduced if the soil has unstable characteristics.
(9) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed 3:1.
(10) Unless specifically designed as a volume control facility, all
stormwater management facilities shall have a minimum slope of
2% extending radially out from the principal outlet structure.
Facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs may have a
bottom slope of zero.
(11) Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities.
(12) Unless specifically designed as a volume control or water quality
facility, all stormwater management facilities must empty over a
period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours
from the end of the facility's inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests
performed at the facility locations and proposed basin bottom
depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must support time-toempty
calculations if infiltration is a factor.
(13) Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.
Discharges to drainage swales shall be dissipated, or piped, to an
acceptable point.
(14) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for all
stormwater management basins and be specific for each type of
basin.
(a) Minimal maintenance, saturation-tolerant vegetation must be
provided in basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
(15) A safety fence may be required, at the discretion of Girard
Borough, for any stormwater management facility. The fence shall
be a minimum of four feet high and of a material acceptable to
Girard Borough. A gate with a minimum opening of 10 feet shall be
provided for maintenance access.
(16) Principal outlet structures. The primary outlet structure shall be
designed to pass all design storms (up to and including the onehundred-
year event) without discharging through the emergency
spillway. All principal outlet structures shall:
§ 360-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-18
1:249
(a) Be constructed of reinforced concrete or an alternative
material approved by Girard Borough. When approved for use,
all metal risers shall:
[1] Be suitably coated to prevent corrosion.
[2] Have a concrete base attached with a watertight
connection. The base shall be sufficient weight to prevent
flotation of the riser.
[3] Provide a trash rack or similar appurtenance to prevent
debris from entering the riser.
[4] Provide an anti-vortex device, consisting of a thin vertical
plate normal to the basin berm.
(b) Provide trash racks to prevent clogging of primary outflow
structure stages for all orifices.
(c) Provide outlet aprons and shall extend to the toe of the basin
slope at a minimum.
(17) Emergency spillways. Any stormwater management facility
designed to store runoff shall provide an emergency spillway
designed to convey the one-hundred-year post-development peak
rate flow with a blocked primary outlet structure. The emergency
spillway shall be designed per the following requirements:
(a) The top of embankment elevation shall provide a minimum one
foot of freeboard above the maximum water surface elevation.
This is to be calculated when the spillway functions for the onehundred-
year post-development inflow, with a blocked outlet
structure.
(b) Avoid locating on fill areas, whenever possible.
(c) The spillway shall be armored to prevent erosion during the
one-hundred-year post-development flow, with a blocked
primary outlet structure.
[1] Synthetic liners or riprap may be used, and calculations
sufficient to support proposed armor must be provided. An
earthen plug must be used to accurately control the
spillway invert if riprap is the proposed armoring material.
Emergency spillway armor must extend up the sides of the
spillway and continue at full width to a minimum of 10 feet
past the toe of slope.
(d) Girard Borough may require the use of additional protection
when slopes exceed 4:1 and spillway velocities might exceed
NRCS standards for the particular soils involved.
§ 360-18 GIRARD CODE § 360-18
1:250
(e) Any underground stormwater management facility (pipe
storage systems) must have a method to bypass flows higher
than the required design (up to a one-hundred-year postdevelopment
inflow) without structural failure or causing
downstream harm or safety risks.
(18) Stormwater management basins. Design of stormwater
management facilities having three feet or more of water depth
(measured vertically from the lowest elevation in the facility to the
crest of the emergency spillway) shall meet the following additional
requirements:
(a) The maximum water depth within any stormwater
management facility shall be no greater than eight feet when
functioning through the primary outlet structure.
(b) The top of embankment width shall be:
[1] For embankments up to four feet, the width shall be at
least six feet;
[2] For embankments between four and six feet, the width
shall be at least eight feet;
[3] For embankments over six feet, the width shall be at least
10 feet.
(c) A ten-foot-wide access to the basin bottom must be provided
with a maximum longitudinal slope of 10%.
(d) Berms shall be constructed using soils that conform to the
unified soil classification of CH, MH, CL or ML. Soils used shall
be tested to determine its density analysis per ASTM 698. The
embankments will be constructed in a maximum of six-inch
lifts. The lifts will each be compacted to a density at least 98%
of the maximum dry density. Each layer of compacted fill shall
be tested to determine its density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM
3017. One test per 50 cubic yards of material placed (at least
one per layer) shall be performed by an independent testing
agency.
(e) A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be
provided under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
The cutoff trench shall run the entire length of the
embankment and tie into undisturbed natural ground.
(f) Anti-seep collars, or a PADEP-approved alternative, must be
provided on all outflow culverts in accordance with the
methodology contained in the latest edition of the PADEP E&S
Manual. An increase in seepage length of 15% must be used in
accordance with the requirements for permanent anti-seep
collars.
§ 360-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-18
1:251
(19) Construction of stormwater management facilities.
(a) Basins used for rate control only shall be installed prior to or
concurrent with any earthmoving or land disturbances which
they will serve. The phasing of their construction shall be noted
in the narrative and on the plan.
(b) Basins that include water quality or recharge components shall
have those components installed in such a manner as to not
disturb or diminish their effectiveness.
(c) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times, with copies being forwarded to
Girard Borough upon request.
(d) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures
shall be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins
within 15 days of construction.
(20) Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of
Girard Borough for BMPs that retain or detain water but are of a
much smaller scale than traditional stormwater management
facilities.
C. Stormwater-carrying facilities.

design dimension of the swales.
(d) Swales shall be designed for stability using velocity or shear
criteria. Velocity criteria may be used for channels with less
than ten-percent slope. Shear criteria may be used for all
swales. Documentation must be provided to support velocity
and/or shear limitations used in calculations.
(e) Where swale bends occur, the computed velocities or shear
stresses shall be multiplied by the following factor for the
purpose of designing swale erosion protection:
[1] When swale bend is 30° to 60°: 1.75.
[2] When swale bend is 60° to 90°: 2.00.
[3] When swale bend is 90° or greater: 2.50.
(f) Manning's "n" values used for swale capacity design must
reflect the permanent condition.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual, as amended herein.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Methodology.
Other methods shall be selected by the design professional based on
the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site and approved by Girard Borough.
C. Rainfall values.
(1) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Natural Resources
Conservation Service Type II, twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution
shall be used in conjunction with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas
14 or be consistent with the following table:
Return Interval
(year)
24-Hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.13
2 2.56
§ 360-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-19
1:255
Return Interval
(year)
24-Hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
10 3.71
25 4.46
50 5.09
100 5.76
D. Runoff volume.
(1) Rational Method: not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development
with curve numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is not
acceptable.
E. Peak flow rates.
(1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should be used by the
design professional if the watershed has more than one main
drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method.
(a) This method is recommended for design of stormwater
management facilities and where stormwater runoff volume
must be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
[1] NRCS's TR-20 or HEC-HMS: no size limitations.
[2] Other models as preapproved by Girard Borough.
(b) The NRCS Antecedent Runoff Condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
F. Runoff coefficients.
(1) Rational Method. Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).77
§ 360-19 GIRARD CODE § 360-19
1:256
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. Use Table C-2 (Appendix C). Curve
numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in hydrologic
models, as they are a design tool with statistical variability. For
large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded to the nearest
whole number.
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious area conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow (good condition).
G. Design storm.
(1) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundredyear
hydrographs through the facility using the Storage Indication
Method or Modified Puls Method. The design storm hydrograph
shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full
hydrograph.
(2) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
H. Time of concentration.
(1) The time of concentration is to represent the average condition that
best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following
time of concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be
used unless another method is preapproved by Girard Borough:
(a) Predevelopment: NRCS's Lag Equation:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6) *60] (minutes)
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by: S
= [(1,000/CN)  10]
77.Editor's Note: Said appendix is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 360-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-19
1:257
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed
(b) Post-development; commercial, industrial, or other areas with
large impervious areas (< 20% impervious area): NRCS
Segmental Method. The length of sheet flow shall be limited to
100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's Equation.
(c) Post-development; residential, cluster, or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area: NRCS Lag
Equation or NRCS Segmental Method.
(2) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The post-development Tc shall never be greater than the
predevelopment Tc for any watershed or subwatershed. This
includes when the designer has specifically used swales to
reduce flow velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the post-development Tc is greater, it will still be set by
default equal to the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
(b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
(c) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc can not be assumed
for predevelopment.
(d) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purposes of Tc calculation.
I. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining predevelopment flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to reduce peak runoff rates in the postdevelopment
analysis. New, additional contributing runoff should not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
J. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's Equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Manning's "n" values shall be
obtained from PennDOT's Drainage Manual, Publication 584. Inlet
control shall be checked at all inlet boxes to ensure the headwater
depth during the ten-year design event is contained below the top of
grate for each inlet box.
K. Girard Borough may require that computed existing runoff rates be
reconciled with field observations, conditions and site history. If the
§ 360-19 GIRARD CODE § 360-19
1:258
designer can substantiate, through actual physical calibration, that
more appropriate runoff and time of concentration values should be
utilized at a particular site, then appropriate variations may be made
upon review and recommendation of Girard Borough.

responsibilities for the continuing operating and maintenance of all
proposed stormwater control facilities, consistent with the following
principles:
(1) If a development consists of structures or lots that are to be
separately owned and in which streets, sewers, and other public
improvements are to be dedicated to Girard Borough, stormwater
control facilities/BMPs may also be dedicated to and maintained by
Girard Borough.
(2) If a development site is to be maintained in a single ownership or if
sewers and other public improvements are to be privately owned
and maintained, then the ownership and maintenance of
stormwater control facilities/BMPs shall be the responsibility of the
owner or private management entity.

shall make the final determination on the continuing maintenance
responsibilities prior to final approval of the SWM site plan and report.
Girard Borough may require a dedication of such facilities as part of the
requirements for approval of the SWM site plan. Such a requirement is
not an indication that Girard Borough will accept the facilities. Girard
Borough reserves the right to accept or reject the ownership and
operating responsibility for any portion of the stormwater management
controls.
D. If Girard Borough accepts ownership of stormwater BMPs, Girard
Borough may, at its discretion, require a fee from the applicant to
Girard Borough to offset the future cost of inspections, operations, and
maintenance.
E. It shall be unlawful to alter or remove any permanent stormwater BMP
required by an approved SWM site plan or to allow the property to
remain in a condition which does not conform to an approved SWM site
plan, unless Girard Borough grants an exception in writing.
A. Prior to final approval of the SWM site plan and report, the applicant
shall sign the operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement (Appendix
A81) covering all stormwater control facilities that are to be privately
owned. The operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement shall be
recorded with the SWM site plan and made a part thereof.
B. Other items may be included in the operation and maintenance (O&M)
agreement where determined necessary to guarantee the satisfactory
operation and maintenance of all BMP facilities. The operation and
maintenance (O&M) agreement shall be subject to the review and
approval of Girard Borough and the Municipal Solicitor.
C. The owner is responsible for operation and maintenance of the
stormwater BMPs. If the owner fails to adhere to the operation and
maintenance (O&M) agreement, the municipality may perform the
services required and charge the owner appropriate fees. Nonpayment
of fees may result in a lien against the property.

ARTICLE V
Procedural Requirements
§ 370-21. Plans for sewage disposal and water supply.
The subdivider shall meet with the Planning Commission and Borough
Council, or their designated representative, regarding methods of sewage
disposal and water supply prior to formal application and shall prepare
suitable sketches and plans sufficient to give a general understanding of his
proposal.
§ 370-22. Submission of preliminary plan.
A preliminary plan in quadruplicate shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for approval, accompanied by a list containing the names
and addresses of the owners of all parcels of land one acre or larger in
area adjacent to the subdivision, together with any proposed subdivision
regulations restricting the use of the lots therein.
§ 370-23. Review of preliminary plan.
§ 370-24. Action by Council.
Within 30 days after receiving the report of the Planning Commission,
the Borough Council shall act thereon, stating, in writing, its approval,
conditional or otherwise, or disapproval. Notification to the subdivider of
the action taken shall be in writing and shall include the specific changes
required, if any, the character and extent of the required improvements
and the amount of construction or improvements, and the amount of the
performance bond or other assurance which it will require.
A. The Planning Commission shall, at its next regular or special meeting,
with the owner or his agent, review the preliminary plan and, after due
investigation of all factors involved, including conformity with this
chapter, Chapter 425, Zoning, of this Code, and its effect on the
abutting properties, suggest such changes or revisions, if any, as may
be in the public interest.
B. Within 10 days of the submission of an acceptable preliminary plan, the
Planning Commission shall notify the abutting landowners, by mail or
otherwise, of the time and place of a meeting to be held, at which said
application will be considered.
C. Within 10 days (after such further revisions or amendment to the
preliminary plans, if required), the Planning Commission shall act and
report thereon to the Borough Council, with a copy to the subdivider,
stating, in writing, its approval, conditional or otherwise, or disapproval
and shall include any further specific changes, the character and extent
of improvements which should be required, and a complete report of
the meeting with the abutting property owners.
§ 370-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-25
1:305
§ 370-25. Approval of preliminary plan.
The approval by the Planning Commission and the Borough Council of a
preliminary plan shall not be construed as an indication of the approval of
the final plan similar to said preliminary plan, nor to the approval of any
feature thereof. The approval of a preliminary plan means only that the
subdivision layout as represented in said plan is tentatively approved as
thus far worked out, for it is obvious that, as further progress is made in
the development of the layout of a subdivision beyond that approved on the
preliminary plan, changes may become necessary in connection with some
feature which has been approved on the preliminary plan, and such changes
would have of necessity been ordered even though said feature or features
had been approved on the preliminary plan.
§ 370-26. Review of final plan.
The original tracing, one process tracing and four prints of the final plan,
together with four prints of the plan profile, shall be presented to the
Planning Commission for its review. The Commission shall, within 20 days,
inform the owner or his agent of any revision or amendment it deems
necessary to protect the public interest, if any be required, and when such
plans are acceptable to signify its approval by signing the original tracing
and two prints to the Borough Council with its recommendations.
§ 370-27. Completion of improvements; financial guarantees.
[Amended 10-19-1992 by Ord. No. 615]
A. No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plat
have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this chapter,
and any walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire hydrants, shade
trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
improvements as may be required by this chapter have been installed in
accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat,
including improvements or fees otherwise required by this chapter, the
developer may deposit with the Borough financial security in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common
amenities, including basins and other related drainage facilities,
recreational facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen
plantings which may be required.
B. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Borough Council shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plat or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial
improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of
contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the
financial security agreement is not executed within 90 days, unless a
§ 370-25 GIRARD CODE § 370-27
1:306
written extension is granted by the Borough Council; such extension
shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the
request of the developer.
C. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Borough may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for
the purposes of this section.
D. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution chosen by the
party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
commonwealth.
E. Such bond or other security shall provide for and secure to the public
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
F. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the developer. Annually, the Borough may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements
which have been completed and the estimated cost for the completion
of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date
of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Borough may require
the developer to post additional security in order to assure that the
financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
G. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Borough, upon the recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the Borough are unable to agree upon an estimate, then
the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Borough and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be
paid equally by the Borough and the applicant or developer.
§ 370-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-27
1:307
H. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
I. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Borough Council may authorize submission of final plats by sections or
stages of development, subject to such requirements or guarantees as
to improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
J. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough Council to
release or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of
the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing,
addressed to the Borough Council, and the Borough Council shall have
45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Borough
Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough Council that such portion
of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance
with the approved plat. Upon such certification, the Borough Council
shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of
an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly representing
the value of the improvements completed, or, if the Borough Council
fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the Borough Council shall
be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The
Borough Council may, prior to final release at the time of completion
and certification by its Engineer, require retention of 10% of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
K. Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Borough Council may
require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of
said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plat for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as
otherwise required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed
15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
L. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Borough, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
§ 370-27 GIRARD CODE § 370-27
1:308
§ 370-28. Release from improvement bond. [Added 10-19-1992 by
Ord. No. 615]
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this section.
M. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as
set forth in this section, the Borough shall not condition the issuance of
building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement
of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted
upon the final plat upon actual completion of the improvements
depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said financial
security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or
buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the improvement
of the streets providing access to and from existing public roads to such
building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or beyond
the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the
reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
A. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough Council, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough
Engineer. The Borough Council shall, within 10 days after receipt of
such notice, direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect all of
the aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer shall, thereupon,
file a report in writing with the Borough Council and shall promptly
mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail.
The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Borough Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Borough
Council; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or
rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said
improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Borough Engineer, said report shall contain a statement
of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
B. The Borough Council shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing, by certified or registered
mail, of the action of said Borough Council with relation thereto.
C. If the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer fails to comply with the
time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be
deemed to have been approved, and the developer shall be released
from all liability pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other
security agreement.
§ 370-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 370-28
1:309
D. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to
complete the same, and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
E. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Borough Council or the Borough
Engineer.
F. Where herein reference is made to the Borough Engineer, he shall be as
a consultant thereto.
G. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Borough for the
reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection of
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of
the Borough Council and as from time to time amended. Such expense
shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary
fees charged by the Borough Engineer or consultant for work
performed for similar services in the community, but in no event shall
the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the engineer or consultant
to the Borough when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on
applicants.
(1) In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense
in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant
shall, within 10 working days of the date of billing, notify the
Borough that such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or
unnecessary, in which case the Borough shall not delay or
disapprove a subdivision or land development application or any
approval or permit related to development due to the applicant's
request over disputed engineer expenses.
(2) If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the Borough and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Borough shall
jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another professional
engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
review the said expenses and make a determination as to the
amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
(3) The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence
and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his
or her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within
50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay
the entire amount determined in the decision immediately.

10-19-1992 by Ord. No. 615]
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final
plat, the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any
corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient
to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Borough Council may, at its
option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action
to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such
security, and not for any other Borough purpose.
§ 370-30. Approval of final plan.
Within 30 days thereafter, the Borough Council shall approve or disapprove
the final plan, stating in writing the reason for disapproval, if such be the
case. Approval shall be indicated by the proper officials signing the original

engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the Borough Engineer
nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Borough or the applicant within the
preceding five years.
(5) The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in
the decision is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the
Borough shall pay the fee of the professional engineer, but
otherwise, the Borough and the applicant shall each pay 1/2 of the
fee of the appointed professional engineer.
A. Upon the approval of a final plat, the developer shall, within 90 days of
such final approval, record such plat in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds of the county in which the Borough is located. The Recorder of
Deeds shall not accept any plat for recording unless such plat officially
notes the approval of the Borough Council and review by the county
planning agency.

§ 370-32. Dedication of improvements.
Streets, parks and other improvements shown on a subdivision plan to
be recorded may be offered for dedication to the Borough by formal
notification thereof on the plan. Failure to note that such improvements
have not been offered for dedication shall constitute an offer of dedication.
Every street, park or other improvement shown on a subdivision plan that is
recorded shall be deemed to be a private street, park or improvement until
same has been accepted by the Borough Council or until it is condemned for
public use.
§ 370-33. Fees. [Amended 10-19-1992 by Ord. No. 615]
B. The recording of the plat shall not constitute grounds for assessment
increases until such time as lots are sold or improvements are installed
on the land included within the subject plat.
A. The subdivider's written application for approval of a subdivision shall
be accompanied by a filing fee in such amount and classification of fees
as may from time to time be established by resolution of the Borough
Council. Current fees shall be on file with the Borough Secretary and
shall be furnished upon request.
B. Review fees.
(1) Review fees shall include the reasonable and necessary charges by
the Borough's professional consultants or Engineer for review and
report to the Borough and shall be set by resolution. Such review
fees shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and
customary charges by the Borough Engineer or consultant for
similar service in the community, but in no event shall the fees
exceed the rate or cost charged by the Engineer or consultant to
the Borough when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed
on applicants.
(2) In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such review
fees, the applicant shall, within 10 days of the billing date, notify
the Borough that such fees are disputed, in which case the Borough
shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development
application due to the applicant's request over disputed fees.
(3) In the event that the Borough and the applicant cannot agree on
the amount of review fees which are reasonable and necessary,
then the fees shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Borough and the applicant or developer.
The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair
and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a
third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer
shall be paid equally by the Borough and the applicant or
developer.

exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the
land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to
the public interest and that the purpose and intent of this chapter is
observed.
B. All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall accompany

A. In addition to other remedies, the Borough may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The

documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the
remedies herein provided.
B. The Borough may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has
been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real
property in violation of this chapter. This authority to deny such a
permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
(1) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(2) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation, without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(3) The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation, without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(4) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation, without regard as
to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.

approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the Borough may require
compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to the
property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real
property.
A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in a
civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay a
judgment of not more than $500, plus all court costs, including

1:323
Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
Rules of Civil Procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the Magisterial District Judge
determining that there has been a violation further determines that
there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership, or corporation
violating this chapter to have believed that there was no such violation,
in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of
a violation by the Magisterial District Judge, and thereafter, each day
that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,

person or transfer, then the tax levied by Girard Borough under the
authority of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and
such one-half rate shall become effective without any action on the part
of Girard Borough; provided, however, that Girard Borough and any
other political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same person
or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to
1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted

from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which Girard Borough is prohibited from taxing under
the Constitution or statutes of the United States.

(5) A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister, and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the
grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor
were making such transfer.
(7) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.

exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries that are entitled to receive the property
or proceeds from the sale of the property under the trust, whether
or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically named. A
trust clause which identifies the contingent beneficiaries by
reference to the heirs of the trust settlor as determined by the laws
of the intestate succession shall not disqualify a transfer from the
exclusion provided by this subsection. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.104
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of a
living trust from the settlor of the living trust. No such exemption

an ordinary trust to a specifically named beneficiary that is entitled
to receive the property under the recorded trust instrument or to a

property into the trust to that beneficiary. However, any transfer of
real estate from a living trust during the settlor's lifetime shall be

made directly from the settlor to the grantee.106
(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee of
a living trust after the death of the settlor of the trust or from a
trustee of a trust created pursuant to the will of a decedent to a

successor trustee.
(14) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party

be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.
(15) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,

corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.
(17) A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that
agency or authority as security for a debt of the grantee or a
transfer to a nonprofit industrial development agency or authority.
(18) A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if the
grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary purpose

§ 377-33. Levy of tax; rate; use of funds.
For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2010, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment within the Borough during
the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such privilege for any
length of time during any tax year shall pay the tax for that year in the
amount of $52, assessed on a pro-rata basis, in accordance with the
provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the following
purposes, as the same may be allocated by the Borough of Girard from
time to time: emergency services, which shall include emergency medical
services, police services and/or fire services; road construction and/or
maintenance; reduction of property taxes; or property tax relief through
implementation of a homestead and farmstead exclusion in accordance with
53 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 85, Subchapter F (relating to homestead property
exclusion).121 The political subdivision shall use no less than 25% of the
funds derived from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in addition
to all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the political
subdivision. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person may be employed.
§ 377-34. Exemptions; refunds.
A. Exemptions. Any person whose total earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for
any calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment
of the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
121. Editor's Note: See 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8581 et seq.
§ 377-32 GIRARD CODE § 377-34
1:342
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2) of this section, the employer shall not withhold the
tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of
the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption
certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political
subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
§ 377-34 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 377-34
1:343
§ 377-35. Duty of employers to collect.
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough of Girard, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Borough of Girard or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth
of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payrollperiod
basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
§ 377-34 GIRARD CODE § 377-35
1:344
§ 377-36. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 377-37. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For
purposes of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 377-34B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 377-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 377-37
1:345
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 377-38. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 377-39. Multiple occupations; employment in multiple political
subdivisions.
§ 377-40. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 377-41. Administration and enforcement.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return

due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.

This article is enacted under authority of § 6109(a)(22) of the Vehicle Code
and gives authority to the Borough to remove and impound vehicles that are
parked overtime on any street in the Borough or in metered and unmetered
parking lots in the Borough, in violation of any provisions of this chapter.
§ 400-31. Authority to remove and impound.
The Borough shall have authority to remove and impound or to order
the removal and impounding of any vehicle parked overtime or otherwise
illegally, provided that the circumstances of its parking were within the
conditions stated in § 400-30 of this article, and provided that no such
vehicle shall be removed or impounded except in strict adherence to the
provisions of this article.
§ 400-32. Approved storage garages; towing and storage charges.
Removal and impounding of vehicles under this article shall be done by only
approved storage garages that shall be designated from time to time by the
Borough Council. Every such garage shall submit evidence to the Borough
Council that it is bonded or has acquired liability insurance in an amount
satisfactory to the Borough Council as sufficient to indemnify owners of
impounded vehicles against loss or damage to those vehicles while in the
custody of the garagekeeper for the purpose of towing or storage. The
approve storage garage shall submit to the Borough Council its schedule
of charges for towing and storage of vehicles under this article, and when
the schedule is approved by the Borough Council, those charges shall be
adhered to by the approved storage area. No different charges shall be
demanded of or collected from any person whose vehicle is removed or
impounded under this article by any approved storage garage. The Borough
Council shall delete from its list of any approved storage garages any
garage that makes any unapproved charge in connection with any vehicle
removed or impounded under this article.

Within 12 hours from the time of removal of any vehicle under authority
granted by this article, the Borough shall send notice of the fact that the

designate the place from which the vehicle was removed, the reason for its
removal and impounding and the garage in which it is impounded.

1:375
§ 400-34. Effect of payment of towing and storage charges.
The payment of any towing and storage charges authorized by this article
shall, unless payment is made under protest, be final and conclusive and
shall constitute a waiver of any right to recover the money so paid. If
payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the
offender shall be entitled to a hearing before a Magisterial District Judge.
Payment of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or driver
of any vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of the
provision of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or impounded.
§ 400-35. Records of vehicles removed and impounded.
The Borough shall cause a record to be kept of all vehicles impounded under

the agents of the owners of those vehicles with information as to the place
of storage of the vehicle.
§ 400-36. Restrictions upon removal.

charge of the vehicle is present and expresses a willingness and intention
to remove the vehicle immediately.

and/or highway adjacent to each parking meter for the purpose of
designating the parking space for which such meter is to be used. Each
vehicle parked adjacent to any parking meter shall be parked wholly within
the lines or markings so placed and applicable to such meter. It shall be
unlawful and a violation of this article to park any vehicle across any such
line or marking or to park any vehicle in such a position that such vehicle

When a parking space in any parking meter zone is parallel with the
adjacent curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in such parking space shall
be parked so that the foremost part of such vehicle shall be nearest to the
parking meter; when a parking space in any parking meter zone is diagonal
to the curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in such parking space shall be
parked with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to such meter. No
trucks, passenger vans or commercial vehicles are permitted to park in any
designated parking meter zone.

limited parking as herein prescribed, the operator of such vehicle shall,
upon entering such parking space, immediately deposit coins of the United
States as shall be specified in the legend upon such parking meter. Upon
the deposit of such coin or coins, and placing the meter in operation, such
parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle. If any vehicle shall
remain in any such parking space for such length of time that the meter
shall indicate by a proper signal that the lawful parking time shall have
expired, such vehicle shall be considered as having been parked overtime,
and the parking of a vehicle overtime shall be a violation of this article.
§ 400-43. Deposit of coins to extend parking time beyond legal
limit.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of this article for any person to deposit
or to cause to be deposited, in any parking meter, any coin for the purpose
of increasing or extending the parking time of any vehicle beyond the total
legal parking time.

It shall be unlawful and a violation of this article for any person to permit
a vehicle to remain in any parking space adjacent to a parking meter when
such meter shall display a signal indicating that such vehicle shall already
have been parked beyond the period of time prescribed for such parking
space.
§ 400-45. Tampering with meters.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of this article for any person to deface,
tamper with, open or willfully break, destroy or impair the usefulness of any

nothing herein shall apply to the servicing or opening of parking meters by
officers, employees and/or peace officers of the Borough under the direction

No. 614]
§ 425-31. Causes of action. [Amended 10-19-1992 by Ord. No. 614]
In case any building, structure, landscaping or land is, or is proposed to
be, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained or
used in violation of this chapter, the Borough Council or, with the approval
of the Borough Council, an officer of the Borough, or any aggrieved owner
or tenant of real property who shows that his property or person will be
substantially affected by the alleged violation, in addition to other remedies,
may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain,
correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent,
in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting
a violation. When any such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant,
notice of that action shall be served upon the Borough at least 30 days prior
to the time the action is begun by serving a copy of the complaint on the
Borough Council. No such action may be maintained until such notice has
been given.
A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon
being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500,
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by
the Borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays
nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure. Each day
that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless
the Magisterial District Judge determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial
District Judge, and thereafter, each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final adjudication
of the violation and judgment.
C. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to
grant to any person or entity other than the Borough the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
D. Magisterial District Judges shall have initial jurisdiction over
proceedings brought under this section.

A. If it appears to the Borough that a violation of this chapter has
occurred, the Borough shall initiate enforcement proceedings by
sending an enforcement notice as provided in this section.
B. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the
parcel on which the violation has occurred, to any person who has filed
a written request to receive enforcement notices regarding that parcel,
and to any other person requested in writing by the owner of record.
C. An enforcement notice shall state at least the following:
(1) The name of the owner of record and any other person against
whom the Borough intends to take action.
(2) The location of the property in violation.
(3) The specific violation, with a description of the requirements which
have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable provisions
of this chapter.
(4) The date before which the steps for compliance must be
commenced and the date before which the steps must be
completed.
(5) That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within a period of 10 days.
(6) That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified,
unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board,
constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly described.
A. The Borough Council may from time to time amend, supplement, or
repeal any of the regulations and provisions of this chapter. The
procedure for the preparation of a proposed zoning ordinance as set
forth in Section 607 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
53 P.S. § 10607, is hereby declared optional.
B. Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the Borough Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. In
addition, if the proposed amendment involves a Zoning Map change,
notice of said public hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the
Borough at points deemed sufficient by the Borough along the
perimeter of the tract to notify potentially interested citizens. The
affected tract or area shall be posted at least one week prior to the date
of the hearing.
C. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the Planning
Commission, the Borough Council shall submit each such amendment

1:425
§ 425-34. Procedure for landowner curative amendments. [Added
10-19-1992 by Ord. No. 614]
to the Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on
such proposed amendment to provide the Planning Commission an
opportunity to submit recommendations.
D. If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is changed substantially, or is revised, to include land
previously not affected by it, the Borough Council shall hold another
public hearing, pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on
the amendment.
E. At least 30 days prior to the public hearing on the amendment by the
Borough Council, the Borough shall submit the proposed amendment to
the County Planning Agency for recommendations.
F. Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this
chapter shall be forwarded to the County Planning Agency.
A. A landowner who desires to challenge, on substantive grounds, the
validity of this chapter or the Zoning Map or any provision thereof
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the Borough
Council, with a written request that his challenge and proposed
amendment be heard and decided as provided in Section 916.1 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S.
§ 10916.1. The curative amendment and challenge shall be referred to
the Planning Commission and the County Planning Agency as provided
in Section 609, and notice of the hearing thereon shall be given as
provided in Sections 610 and 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10609,
10610, and 10916.1.
B. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Section 908 of the
MPC, 53 P.S. § 10908, and all references therein to the Zoning Hearing
Board shall, for purposes of this section, be references to the Borough
Council. If the Borough does not accept a landowner's curative
amendment brought in accordance with this subsection, and a court
subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the court's decision
shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this entire chapter and
Zoning Map, but only for those provisions which specifically relate to
the landowner's curative amendment and challenge.
C. The Borough Council, if it determines that a validity challenge has
merit, may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without
revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the
challenged defects. The Borough Council shall consider the curative
amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:

(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of this chapter or Zoning Map;
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the
tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts; and
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
A. If the Borough determines that this chapter, or any portion hereof, is
substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
(1) The Borough shall declare, by formal action, this chapter or
portions hereof substantially invalid and propose to prepare a
curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days of
such declaration and proposal, the Borough Council shall:
(a) By resolution, make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of this chapter, which may include:
[1] References to specific uses which are either not permitted
or not permitted in sufficient quantity;
[2] Reference to a class of use or uses which requires revision;
or
[3] Reference to this entire chapter which requires revisions.
(b) Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to this
chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
B. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Borough shall enact a curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm the
validity of, this chapter pursuant to the provisions of Section 609 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S.
§ 10609, in order to cure the declared invalidity of this chapter.

the MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10909.1, 10916.1, subsequent to the declaration
and proposal based upon the grounds identical or substantially similar

completion of the procedures set forth in Subsections A and B, no rights
to a cure pursuant to the provisions of Sections 609.1 and 916.1 of the
MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10609.1, 10916.1, shall, from the date of the declaration

D. The Borough, having utilized the procedures set forth in this section,
may not again utilize said procedure for a period of 36 months following
the date of enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the
validity of this chapter; provided, however, if, after the date of
declaration and proposal, there is a substantially new duty imposed
upon the Borough by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a
Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the Borough may utilize the
provisions of this section to propose a curative amendment to this
chapter to fulfill said duty or obligation.
A. There is hereby created for the Borough a Zoning Hearing Board in
accordance with the provisions of Article IX of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10901 et seq.

nonfeasance in office or for other just cause by a majority vote of the

hearing shall be held in connection with the vote if the member shall
request it in writing.
D. The Board shall elect from its own membership its officers, who shall

Borough, may, prior to the decision of the hearing, waive decision or
findings by the Board and accept the decision or findings of the hearing
officer as final.

transcript is ordered by the Board or hearing officer or shall be paid by
the person appealing from the decision of the Board if such appeal is

Conclusions based on any provisions of this chapter or of any law,
ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision
relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in
the light of the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing
officer, and there has been no stipulation that his decision or findings
are final, the Board shall make his report and recommendations
available to the parties within 45 days, and the parties shall be entitled
to make written representations thereon to the Board prior to final

date of the applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be
deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the
applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time.

of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove
provided, the Board shall give public notice of the said decision within
10 days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in
the same manner as provided in Subsection A of this section. If the

§ 425-40. Special exceptions. [Added 10-19-1992 by Ord. No. 614]
Where the Borough Council, in this chapter, has stated special exceptions
to be granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to express
standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide requests for such
special exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria. In
granting a special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as
shall be to the Planning Commission, and all appeals from the
decision of the Planning Commission shall be to court.
A. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of
application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning

anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision
on a tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer
on a challenge to the validity of this chapter or an amendment hereto
or map or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final
approval, except in the case where the final submission substantially
deviates from the approved tentative approval.
B. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.
A. Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
and during its pendency before the Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning
Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall
be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or
body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order,
which may be granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction
of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other

jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.

determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to
petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.
C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond,
and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a
bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the
petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning
§ 425-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 425-44

appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys'

§ 425-46. Purpose; scope. [Amended 10-19-1992 by Ord. No. 614]
§ 425-47. Objectives.
The objective of this article is to develop properties for single-family and
multifamily housing which provide:
A. In an era of increasing urbanization and with a growing demand for
housing of all types and design, the purpose of this article is to
encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so that
the growing demand for housing may be met by a greater variety in
type, design and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more
efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings so that greater
opportunities for better housing and recreation may extend to all
citizens and residents of this Borough, and, in order to encourage a
more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes
in the technology of land development so that economies secured may
inure to the benefit of those who need homes and, in aid of these
purposes, to provide a procedure which can relate the type, design and
layout of residential development to the particular site and the
particular demand for housing existing at the time of development in a
manner consistent with preservation of the property values within
existing residential areas and to insure that the increased flexibility of
regulations over land development authorized herein is carried out
under such administration standards and procedures as shall
encourage the disposition of proposals for land development without
undue delay, the following powers are granted.
B. This article insures that the provisions of this chapter which are
concerned in part with the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk,
density and open space within each zoning district shall not be applied
to the improvement of land by other than lot-by-lot development in a
manner that would destroy the objectives of this chapter.
A. A suitable residential environment by utilizing the potential advantages
of the site, including suitable placement of the buildings and facilities in
relation to the site and surrounding influences.
B. A land use intensity appropriate to the character of the site and its
location in the anticipated community pattern.
C. Adequate open space related to buildings and other land improvements.
D. Sufficient livability space (nonvehicular open space) for use of the
occupants and for visual appeal.

§ 425-49. General standards.
The planned development must meet all of the following general standards:
§ 425-50. Applicable districts; permitted uses.
A. The planned development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
B. The planned development is an effective and unified treatment of the
development possibilities on the project site; and the development plan
makes appropriate provision for the preservation of streams and stream
banks, wooded cover, rough terrain and similar areas.
C. The planned development shall be planned and developed to harmonize
with any existing or proposed development in the area surrounding the
project site.
D. A performance bond for all improvements in the development must be
posted as required.
E. Provision for sewerage treatment must be made and proof of such
submitted with the application.
A. Planned residential developments may be approved in the following
zoning districts:
(1) R-1 Low-Density Residential with a land use intensity rating of 35.
(2) R-2 Medium-Density Residential with a land use intensity rating of
40.
(3) R-3 High-Density Residential with a land use intensity rating of 50.
B. Permitted uses include:
(1) Dwelling units in detached, semidetached, attached or multistoried
structures or any combination thereof; and
§ 425-48 GIRARD CODE § 425-50
1:452
§ 425-51. Calculation of project densities.
The type and number of dwelling units which may be constructed within a
planned development will be determined by using the Land Use Intensity
Rating System, which is described as follows, and within the required land
use intensity rating set forth in this chapter for each zoning district where
planned residential developments are permitted, i.e., R-1, R-2, and R-3.
(2) Those nonresidential uses deemed to be appropriate (by the
Borough) for incorporation in the design of the planned residential
development.
A. Land Use Intensity System.
(1) The Land Use Intensity System correlates the land area, floor area,
open space, livability space, recreation space, and car storage
capacity of a planned residential development to prevent
overdevelopment or overcrowding of a building site.
(2) The system lets the developer choose the type of residential
construction he wishes to build, i.e., single-family homes, two-story
townhouses, multifamily apartments, etc. The system also indicates
the type of construction which can be developed at any given
intensity.
(3) For example, a land use intensity (LUI) of 40 permits one- or twostory
townhouses, two-story detached units, or two-story
apartments and then prescribes the land use intensity standards
such as maximum floor area and minimum open space for the type
of residential construction selected.
B. The Land Use Intensity Ratio Table. The Land Use Intensity Ratio Table
shows the ratios for floor area, open space, livability space, and car
storage which apply at various levels of land use intensity. Also shown,
for each of the several common residential building types, is the
optimum range of land use intensity characteristics for such building
type when used alone on a site.
C. Land use intensity rating. The land use intensity for a planned
residential development shall conform to the land use intensity rating
for the zoning district in which the development is located.
(1) Rating scale. In order to measure the land use intensity of proposed
sites and project plans, the Borough shall use the Land Use
Intensity Table. These ratings correlate the land area, floor area,
open space, livability space, recreation space, and car storage
capacity of a project.
(2) Rating for the site. After analyzing the characteristics of various
sites and their relation to the Borough's Comprehensive Plan, the
Borough determined a land use intensity rating for various zoning
districts. The determination of the land use intensity rating is
§ 425-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 425-51
1:453
important, as it represents the maximum land use intensity
acceptable to the Borough for the current use of the site for a
housing development. If a portion(s) of a site is located in more
than one zoning district, the land use intensity rating for each
zoning district shall apply to each portion(s) alone in substantially
the same manner as it would if the portion were a separate site.
(3) Number of living units. The total number of living units will depend
upon the size (square footage) of various individual dwelling units.
However, the total floor area for all dwelling units shall not exceed
the permitted floor area for the site as calculated by multiplying the
area of the site by the permitted floor area ratio.
D. Building types. For each of several common building types, the Land
Use Intensity Ratio Table shows the optimum range of land use
intensity which is characteristic of the building type where used alone
on all or a part of a site. To determine the building type or types usually
suitable to a site, compare the land use intensity rating with the
possible building combinations shown in the left-hand margin of the
table. For example, an intensity rating of 45 suggests two-story
townhouses and two-story apartments. Any single building type
(common or special) or any group of varied building types are
acceptable on a site, provided the requirements stated below are met:
(1) The sizes and types of living meet long-term needs.
(2) The property has adequate visual appeal.
(3) The property can be operated and maintained at costs reasonably
related to income.
(4) The land use and other site planning standards of this chapter are
met.
(5) Zoning and other local regulations are complied with.
E. Residential uses and nonresidential uses. For these land use standards,
the measurements for FAR, OSR, LSR, RSR, OCR, TCR, etc., include
only such land area, floor area, open space and car storage as are
allocated for residential use and for uses incidental to, and compatible
with, the residential use, such as recreation facilities serving the
occupants or a coffee shop in a recreation building.
F. Land use standards for the site. The land use intensity rating ascribes
to the site the land use standards shown for that intensity number as
shown on the Land Use Intensity Table and in this chapter. The
standards or ratios are defined as follows:
(1) The maximum floor area ratio (FAR): the maximum square footage
of total floor area (all stories) permitted for each square foot of land
area.
§ 425-51 GIRARD CODE § 425-51
1:454
(2) The minimum open space ratio (OSR): the minimum square footage
of open space which shall be provided for each square foot of land
area.
(3) The minimum livability space ratio (LSR): the minimum square
footage of livability (nonvehicular) outdoor space which shall be
provided for each square foot of land area.
(4) The minimum recreation space ratio (RSR): the minimum square
footage of recreation space required for each square foot of land
area.
(5) The minimum occupant car ratio (OCR): the number of parking and
garage spaces without time limits required for each living unit.
(6) The minimum total car ratio (TCR): the total number of parking and
garage spaces required for each living unit, including spaces
without time limits (primarily for occupants) and spaces available
for limited time periods (primarily for guests).
G. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
BUILDING AREA (BA)  The total land area covered by residential
buildings, measured horizontally from the faces of the exterior walls
(or the exterior lines of omitted walls) at main grade level. Entrance
platforms, steps and terraces are not countable as building area.
FLOOR AREA (F) and FLOOR AREA RATIO (FAR)  The total floor area
for residential use on all floors of a building or buildings, measured
from the outside faces of the exterior walls, including halls, lobbies,
stairways, elevator shafts, enclosed porches, balconies and belowgrade
floor areas used for habitation and residential access.
LAND AREA (LA)  The land area used for LUI computations is the
total site area within the property lines of the proposed site.
Noncountable:
(a) Open terrace, patio, atrium or balcony;
(b) Carport, garage, breezeway or toolshed;
Special purpose areas for the common use of all the occupants,
such as a recreation room or social hall;
(c)
(d) Staff space for therapy or examination in care housing;
(e) Basement spaces not used for living accommodations; or
(f) Any commercial or other nonresidential space.
(1)
The floor area ratio (FAR) times the land area (LA) equals the
maximum amount of floor area (FA) acceptable for the development
of a property. (FAR x LA = FA; or FA divided by LA = FAR.)
(2)
§ 425-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 425-51
1:455
LIVABILITY SPACE (LS) and LIVABILITY SPACE RATIO (LSR)  The
open space used for people, including lawns, planting space, walks,
paved terraces and sitting areas and the unpaved portions of streets
rights-of-way. No paved areas for car traffic or parking can be included
as livability space. The livability space shall be so related to the land
area that it is consistent with the character of the site and its location in
the community; adequate for the exterior property attractiveness that is
needed for long-term marketability; adequate for outdoor living space
for the occupants; and not less than the minimum livability space ratio
(LSR) shown in the Land Use Intensity Ratio Table for the selected land
use intensity rating. The livability space ratio (LSR) times the land area
(LA) equals the minimum amount of livability space acceptable for the
development of a property. (LSR x LA = LS; LS divided by LA = LSR.)
OCCUPANT CAR SPACE (OCS) and OCCUPANT CAR RATIO (OCR) 
A garage, carport or other parking space available to the residents
without time limits. Occupant car space shall be so related to the living
units that the relationship shall be consistent with the site and its
location in the community; adequate to meet the needs of the occupants
and their guests without interfering with normal traffic movements;
adequate for the storage of the occupants' boats, trailers, recreational
vehicles, and other permitted vehicles, as well as cars, as appropriate
to the anticipated need; and not less than the minimum occupant car
ratio (OCR) and minimum total car ratio (TCR) shown in the Land Use
Intensity Ratio Table for the selected land use intensity rating. The
occupant car ratio (OCR) times the number of living units (LU) equals
the minimum number of car parking spaces (CPS) for residents in the
development of a property. (OCR x LU = CPS; or CPS divided by LU =
OCR.)
OPEN SPACE (OS) and OPEN SPACE RATIO (OSR)  The relation of
open space to the land area shall be consistent with the character of the
site and its location in the anticipated community pattern; adequate for
the needs of the occupants for livability open space and for traffic and
parking space; and not less than the minimum open space ratio (OSR)
shown in the Land Use Intensity Ratio Table for the selected land use
intensity rating. Open space is the sum of the uncovered open space
and 1/2 of the covered open space.
UNCOVERED OPEN SPACE   The horizontal area of the site
not covered by building area (BA), plus open exterior balconies and
roof area improved as recreation space (RS).
(1)
COVERED OPEN SPACE (COS)   The usable open space that is
closed to the sky, having two clear, unobstructed open or partially
opened sides (minimum 50% open). The square foot amount
countable as covered open space may not exceed the square foot
amount of the open sides. Examples: covered balconies, covered
portions of improved roof area or spaces under buildings supported
by posts, columns or cantilevers.
(2)
§ 425-51 GIRARD CODE § 425-51
1:456
RECREATION SPACE (RS) and RECREATION SPACE RATIO (RSR) 
The open space ratio (OSR) times the land area (LA) equals the
minimum amount of open space acceptable for the development of
a property. (OSR x LA = OS; or OS divided by LA = OSR.)
(3)
General. Adequate recreation facilities for the residents shall be
provided in locations easily accessible to the living units and where
they do not impair the view and privacy of living units.
(1)
Passive recreation. Attractive sitting areas shall be appropriate in
size, type and number to the needs of the residents. The design
and location of sitting areas may vary according to the type of
projects, from a sun deck, balcony, or roof garden to a paved area
overlooking a pleasant view, or a shaded area along a walk.
(2)
Active recreation. Active recreation areas shall be appropriate for
the needs of the residents. Activities may vary from horseshoe
pitching, shuffleboard, swimming or tennis to golf, horseback
riding, or boating in large projects. Well-equipped playgrounds of
adequate size and number shall be provided where it is anticipated
that children will occupy the premises.
(3)
Required recreation space.
The recreation space required by the Land Use Intensity
Standards is that part of the livability space which provides
one or more major open spaces in a planned residential
development.
(a)
The recreation space ratio (RSR) times the land area (LA)
equals the minimum amount of recreation space acceptable for
the development of a property. (RSR x LA = RS; or RS divided
by LA = RSR.)
(b)
The relation of total countable recreation space to the total
floor area shall not be less than shown in the Land Use
Intensity Table for the selected land use intensity rating
determined. As part of the required recreation space (RS),
permanent recreation space abutting the property and
available for use by the residents may be considered.
(c)
(4)
Countable as required recreation space.
Where the required recreation is greater than 10,000 square
feet, the smallest countable recreation area shall be 10,000
square feet. Small playgrounds or sitting areas less than
10,000 square feet in size count as livability space but do
not count as required recreation space. Where several areas
are to be counted as part of the required recreation space,
each must be at least 10,000 square feet. The least dimension
of a countable recreation area shall average not less than
100 feet and not be less than 50 feet at any point. Areas
(a)
(5)
§ 425-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 425-51
1:457
TOTAL CAR SPACE and TOTAL CAR RATIO (TCR)  The number
of spaces (or space) available to the occupants without time limits
(counted in OCR), plus the number of spaces available for limited
time periods (primarily for guests). The total car ratio (TCR) times the
number of living units (LU) equals the minimum number of car parking
spaces acceptable for a development, including space for guest cars.
(TCR x LU = TCS; or TCS divided by LU = TCR.)
designated for recreation space shall be suitably developed for
the intended purpose shown on the development plan. Areas
such as steep slopes (hillsides), narrow ravines and/or stream
valleys or other remnant-type parcels of land shall not be used
or counted as required recreation space unless such parcels
are specifically improved for the particular recreation activity
proposed on the plan.
Where the required recreation space is less than 625 square
feet, a specific recreation area need not be designated on
the development (site) plan, as it will be considered part of
the required livability space. The dimensions for recreation
areas under 10,000 square feet may be smaller than those for
a countable recreation area. All areas counted as recreation
space shall be at least 30 feet away from any point on the
perimeter boundary line, and at least 20 feet away from any
structure proposed as part of the development.

A. The location of all structures shall be as shown on the final plans.
B. The proposed location and arrangement shall not be detrimental to
existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the existing or
prospective development of the neighborhood. There shall be no
minimum or maximum percentage of lot coverage and no minimum lot
width in the planned development. However, every dwelling shall have
access to a public street, court, walkway, or other area dedicated to
public use. No dwellings and no addition to any dwellings shall be
erected within a distance of less than the height of the highest adjacent
building or height of proposed structure, whichever is greater.
C. Vehicular access to dwellings by means of adequate service drive and/
or emergency entrances shall be provided in all cases where dwellings
do not front on a public street or where the Borough deems necessary
for public safety. Furthermore, all plans must be reviewed by the
Borough Fire Chief to insure that fire vehicles have adequate access to
all structures.
A. The requirements of this section apply only to structures located within
200 feet of the perimeter of a planned development.
B. If topographical or other barriers do not provide adequate privacy for
existing uses adjacent to the planned development, the Borough may
require either or both of the following:
(1) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned development
must be set back by a distance sufficient to protect the privacy and
amenity of adjacent existing uses, but in no case less than the
height of the aforementioned buildings.
(2) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned development
must be screened in such a manner which is sufficient to protect
the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses.
A. The development plan will contain areas to be allocated for common
open space which satisfy the standards governing the usability and
quality of common open space that is contained in the minimum open
space ratio.
B. No open area may be accepted as common open space under the
provisions of this article unless it meets the following standards:
§ 425-52 GIRARD CODE § 425-55
1:460
§ 425-56. Conveyance and maintenance of common open space.
(1) The location, shape, size and character of the common open space
must be suitable for the planned development.
(2) Common open space must be suitably improved for its intended
use, but common open space containing natural features worthy of
preservation may be left unimproved. The buildings, structures and
improvements which are permitted in the common open space
must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the
common space and must conserve and enhance the amenities of
the common open space having regard to its topography and
unimproved condition. Lakes, swamps and other water bodies may
not be used in computing common open space.
(3) The development schedule which is part of the development plan
must coordinate the improvement of the common open space, the
construction of buildings, structures and improvements in the
common open space and the construction of residential dwellings
in the planned development.
(4) If the final development plan provides for buildings, structures and
improvements in the common open space which exceed $1,000, the
developer must provide a bond in the estimated amount of the
improvements assuring that the buildings, structures and
improvements will be completed. The Council shall release the
bond or other assurance when the buildings, structures or
improvements have been completed according to the development
plan.
A. All land shown on the final development plan as common open space
must be conveyed and/or maintained under one of the following
options:
(1) It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to maintain
the common open space and any buildings, structures or
improvements which have been and will be placed in it, in which
case the general public must have use of the open space.
(2) It may be conveyed to the trustees provided for in an indenture
establishing an association or similar organization for the
maintenance of the planned development. The common open space
must be conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants which are
approved by the Borough Council, restrict the common space to the
uses specified on the final development plan, and provide for the
maintenance of the common open space in a manner which assures
its continued use for its intended purpose.
(3) The developer/landowner may elect to assume the maintenance of
all open space and/or the maintenance of all roads, parking areas,
drainage facilities and recreation facilities. Should a developer
§ 425-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 425-56

choose this option, his intention to maintain such open space and
facilities must be so stated in the development plan and application
for tentative approval.
B. No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the final
development plan unless the final development plan has been amended
to permit that use. However, no change of use authorized under
§ 425-57 may be considered as a waiver of any of the covenants limiting
the use of common open space areas, and all rights to enforce these
covenants against any use permitted under § 425-57 are expressly
reserved.
C. If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, one of the
following methods of enforcement must be provided:
(1) The legal right to develop the common open space for the uses not
specified in the final development plan must be approved by the
Council.
(2) Restrictions governing the use, improvement and maintenance of
the common open space must be stated as conditions to the
conveyance of the common open space, the fee title to the common
open space to vest in a public agency in the event of a substantial
default in the stated conditions.
(3) If the common open space is not maintained in reasonable order
and condition and in accordance with the development plan, the
Council may serve written notice to the organization responsible
for maintenance or to the residents of the planned residential
development, setting forth:
(a) The manner in which the organization has failed to maintain
the common open space in reasonable condition.
(b) A demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be corrected
within 30 days thereof.
(c) The date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held
within 14 days from the date of the notice.
(d) If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modifications thereof shall not be corrected within said 30 days
or any extension thereof, the Council may enter upon said
common space and maintain the same for a period of one year
in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within
the planned residential development and to prevent the
common open space from becoming a public nuisance.
Maintenance by the Borough shall not constitute a taking of
said common space, nor vest in the public any rights to use the
same. Before the expiration of said year, the Borough shall,
upon its own initiative or upon the request of the organization
theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the common
§ 425-56 GIRARD CODE § 425-56
1:462
space, call a public hearing, after giving notice to said
organization and/or to the residents of the planned residential
development. The hearing will be held by the Borough or its
designated agency and shall provide said organization or the
residents of the planned residential development opportunity
to show cause why the Borough shall not, at its option,
continue said maintenance for a succeeding year. If the
Borough or its designated agency determines that said
organization is ready and able to maintain said common open
space in a reasonable condition, the Borough shall cease to
maintain said common open space at the end of a said year.
If the Borough determines that such organization is not ready
and able to maintain said common open space in a reasonable
condition, the Borough may, in its discretion, continue to
maintain said common open space during the next succeeding
year and, subject to similar hearing and determination, in each
year thereafter. The decision of the Borough shall be subject to
appeal to court in the same manner, and within the same time
limitation, as is provided for zoning appeals by Act 247 of 1968,
as amended.152
(e) The cost of such maintenance by the Borough shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the planned residential
development that have the right of enjoyment of the common
open space and shall become a lien on said properties. The
Borough, at the time of entering upon said common space for
the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of lien in the
office of the Prothonotary of Erie County, Pennsylvania, upon
the properties affected by the lien within the planned
residential development.
D. This article further establishes the special requirements and
procedures which are applicable for any building or land development
intended to be maintained under the condominium form of ownership.
Furthermore, this article provides for the revocation of an approved
condominium and subsequent recording of same by appropriate means.
The procedure set forth in this section shall be followed by all
applicants proposing to develop land or buildings to be maintained
under the condominium form of ownership, or to convert existing land
or buildings from their present ownership to the condominium form of
ownership.
(1) Requirements. In addition to all other requirements set forth in this
article and not in conflict with the requirements of this section, a
declaration, a declaration plan and a code of regulations shall be
required for any proposed condominium and shall be approved by
the Borough Council, as appropriate, in accordance with the

enjoyment;
(5) The relationship, either beneficial or adverse, of the proposed
planned residential development to the neighborhood in which it is
proposed to be established; and
(6) In the case of a development plan which proposed development
over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions
intended to protect the interests of the public and of the residents

D. When a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or without
conditions, the Borough Council may set forth, in the official written
communication, the time within which an application for final approval
of the development plan shall be filed; or, in the case of a development
plan which provides for development over a period of years, the periods

certified by the Borough Secretary and shall be filed in his office, and a
certified copy shall be mailed to the landowner. Where tentative
approval has been granted, the same shall be noted on the Zoning Map.
B. Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of the
planned residential development for recording or authorize
development or the issuance of any building permits. A development
plan given tentative approval as submitted, or with conditions accepted
by the landowner, shall not be modified or revoked, nor otherwise
impaired, by action of the Borough during the preparation of an
application for final approval without the consent of the landowner,
provided that the landowner has not defaulted nor violated any of the
conditions of tentative approval; and an application(s) for final approval
is filed within the time period specified in the official written
communication granting tentative approval.
C. If the landowner abandons a development plan between the time
tentative approval was granted, but prior to receiving final approval,
the tentative approval shall be revoked, and the area included in the
development plan shall again be subject to all applicable local
ordinances. "Abandonment by the developer" shall mean that the
developer has notified the Borough Council of his intentions to abandon

the project or failed to file an application(s) for final approval within the
time period stated in the grant of tentative approval.
A. There shall be no sale of lots until final approval.
B. Final approval shall not be given until all improvements have either
been completed in accordance with tentative plan approval or a
performance bond in the estimated amount of improvements not
completed is posted with the Borough. Bonding shall be in accord with
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.156
C. Within six months following the tentative approval of the development
plan, the applicant shall file with the Borough Council a final
development plan containing, in final form, the information required on
the preliminary plan. The Council may extend, upon written request of
the landowner, the period for filing the final development plan up to six
months, provided good cause is shown.
D. A public hearing on an application for final approval of the development
plan, or part thereof, shall not be required, provided the development
plan, or part thereof, submitted for final approval is in compliance with
the development plan theretofore given tentative approval and with any
specified conditions attached thereto.
E. Within 30 days after the application for final approval is filed, the
Borough shall grant final approval of the development plan if it meets
all requirements of this article and the official written communication
granting tentative approval.
F. If the final development plan as submitted contains variations from the
development plan given tentative approval, the Borough may refuse to
grant final approval and shall, within 30 days from the filing of the
application for final approval, so advise the landowner, in writing, of
said refusal, setting forth the reasons why one or more of said
variations are not in the public interest.
G. If the final development plan is disapproved, the landowner may either:
(1) Refile his application for final approval without the objected
variations.
(2) File a written request with the Borough asking that it hold a public
hearing on the application for final approval. The request must be
submitted during the period of time the landowner is entitled to
apply for final approval or within 30 additional days, if the time for
applying for final approval shall have already passed at the time
when the landowner was advised that the development plan was
not in substantial compliance.

(a) Procedure if a public hearing is requested.
[1] The hearing shall be held within 30 days pursuant to
public notice after the request was submitted by the

A. A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by the Borough Council and
shall be filed of record forthwith in the office of the Recorder of Deeds
before any development shall take place in accordance therewith. Upon
the filing of record of the development plan, the zoning and subdivision
regulations otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall
cease to apply thereto. Pending completion, in accordance with the time
provisions stated in Section 508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S. § 10508, of said planned
residential development or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that
has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said
development plan, or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made,
except with the consent of the landowner. Upon approval of a final plat,
the developer shall record the plat in accordance with the provisions of
Section 513(a) of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10513(a), and post financial
security in accordance with Section 509 of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10509,
and in accordance with Chapter 370, Subdivision and Land
Development.
B. In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given final
approval, and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such plan or the
section thereof that has been finally approved, and shall so notify the
Borough Council, in writing, or, in the event the landowner shall fail to
commence and carry out the planned residential development in
accordance with the time provisions stated in Section 508 of the MPC,
53 P.S. § 10508, after final approval has been granted, no development
or further development shall take place on the property included in the
development plan until after the said property is reclassified by
enactment of an amendment to this chapter in the manner prescribed
§ 425-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 425-62
1:471
§ 425-63. Enforcement; modification of plan provisions.
To further the mutual interest of the residents of a planned residential
development and the public in preserving the integrity of the development
plan as approved, and to insure that modifications in the development
plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of said residents upon the
provisions of the development plan, nor result in changes that would
adversely affect the public interest, the enforcement and modification of the
provisions of the development plan as finally approved, whether they are
recorded by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, shall be subject to the
following provisions:
for such amendments in Article VI of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10601 et seq.,
and this chapter.
A. The provisions of the development plan relating to the use, bulk, and
location of buildings and structures; the quantity and location of
common open space, except as otherwise provided in this article; and
the intensity of use or the density of residential units shall run in favor
of the Borough and shall be enforceable in law or in equity by the
Borough, without limitation on any powers of regulation otherwise
granted the Borough.
B. All provisions of the development plan shall run in favor of the residents
of the planned residential development, but only to the extent expressly
provided in the development plan and in accordance with the terms of
the development plan and to the extent said provisions, whether
recorded by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be enforced at
law or equity by said residents acting individually, jointly or through an
organization designated in the development plan to act on their behalf;
provided, however, that no provisions of the development plan shall be
implied, except as to those portions of the development plan which have
been finally approved and have been recorded.
C. All those provisions of the development plan authorized to be enforced
by the Borough under this section may be modified, removed, or
released by the Borough, except grants or easements relating to the
service or equipment of a public utility, subject to the following
conditions:
(1) No such modification, removal, or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the Borough shall affect the rights of the
residents of the planned residential development to maintain and
enforce those provisions at law or equity as provided in this
section.
(2) No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the Borough shall be permitted, except upon a
finding by the Council following a public hearing thereon pursuant
to public notice called and held in accordance with the provisions of
this article that the same is consistent with the efficient

§ 425-64. Judicial review.
Any decision of the Girard Borough Council under this article granting or
denying tentative or final approval of a development plan shall be subject to
appeal to court in the same manner, and within the same time limitation, as
provided for zoning appeals by Act 247 of 1968, as amended, and known as
the "Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code."157

development and preservation of the entire planned residential
development, does not adversely affect either the enjoyment of
land abutting upon or across the street from the planned
residential development or the public interest, and is not granted
solely to confer a special benefit upon any person.
D. Residents of the planned residential development may, to the extent and
in the manner expressly authorized by the provisions of the
development plan, modify, remove, or release their rights to enforce the
provisions of the development plan, but no such action shall affect the
right of the Borough to enforce the provisions of this section.
A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
planned residential development provisions of this chapter shall, upon
being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500,
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by
the Borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays
nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the appropriate Rules of Civil Procedure. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless the Magisterial District Judge determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or corporation violating these provisions to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial
District Judge, and thereafter, each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees collected for the violation of planned residential
development provisions of this chapter shall be paid over to the
Borough.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.

grant to any person or entity other than the Borough the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
D. Magisterial District Judges shall have initial jurisdiction over
proceedings brought under this section.
