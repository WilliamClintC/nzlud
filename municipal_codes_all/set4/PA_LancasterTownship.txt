nature of a zoning ordinance "should reflect the policy goals of the statement of community
development objectives...and give consideration to the character of the municipality, the needs of the
citizens and the suitabilities and special nature of particular parts of the municipality;" § 602 thereof,

established neighborhoods through appropriate land use controls and codes enforcement. This is
reiterated and strengthened in the multimunicipal comprehensive plan to be adopted in 2007.
It is the intent of this chapter to establish a procedure for review of applications for demolition,
razing or removal so that the structural integrity of a building can be determined; opportunities for
continued use or adaptive reuse can be explored; the impact of the proposed demolition, razing or

vote;
The Historic Commission may make, alter and rescind rules and forms for its procedure, and
keep full public records of its business, which records shall be the property of the Township.
§ 131-6. Prohibited activities.
Compliance. No historic resource within Lancaster Township shall hereafter be removed,
relocated, altered or demolished, in whole or in part, without full compliance with the terms of this
chapter.
Demolition, removal or relocation of historic resources. General requirements:
No Class 1 or Class 2 historic resource (as defined below in this chapter) shall be
demolished, altered, removed or otherwise relocated without a permit obtained under the
provisions of this section, except for emergency demolitions.
Emergency demolitions to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Lancaster
Township are regulated under the Lancaster Township Property Maintenance Code, BOCA
1996 or its successors, and the provisions of that code shall take precedence over the
provisions contained herein.
§ 131-7. Application and approval process.
Application procedures: Applications for demolition review may be obtained at the municipal
building.
Preapproved activities: If the Zoning Officer determines that the historic resource has no historic or
architectural significance and does not contribute to the character of the property or neighborhood,
the requested permit may be issued without any further review. The Zoning Officer shall keep a
record of these determinations to include: name of property owner; address where structure is
located; date of determination; date permit was issued; and a photograph of the structure. This list
shall be provided to the Historical Commission for its review monthly.
Criteria for review: Applicants for a permit to demolish must provide, as part of their application, a
written statement as to whether the following statements are correct and detailed substantiation
for each statement which is believed to be correct. In each instance the burden of proof is on the
property owner to demonstrate that the property owner has been deprived any profitable use of
the relevant parcel as a whole. The recommendation of the Historical Commission and the
decision of the Board of Supervisors shall be based upon a review of the information submitted by
the applicant against all criteria and not any one criterion. The goals and development objectives
of the Township shall also be considered.
It is not feasible to continue the current use.
Other uses permitted within the underlying zoning district, either as permitted uses, special
exception uses, or conditional uses, have been denied or are not feasible due to constraints
on the building or structure.
Adaptive use opportunities do not exist due to constraints related to the building, structure or
property.

The building, its permitted uses, and adaptive use potential do not provide a reasonable rate
of return, based on a reasonable initial investment. Such reasonable rate of return shall be
calculated with respect to the property taken as a whole.
The applicant has not contributed to the existing conditions, either through neglect or prior
renovation, conversion, alteration or similar physical action.
The demolition or removal will not adversely affect the character of the property, streetscape,
neighborhood or community.
A proposed new building, structure or use (if applicable) on or of the property will not
adversely affect the character of the streetscape, neighborhood or community.
The building is structurally unsound.
The denial of demolition would result in unreasonable economic hardship to the owner. The
requirements for proving unreasonable economic hardships may be obtained from the Zoning
Officer.
Sale of the building or structure is impossible or impractical.
Denial of demolition will deprive the property as a whole of all beneficial use.
As part of the review process, the Historical Commission and/or the Board of Supervisors may
request additional information to be provided. Such materials may include but are not limited to:
Site plan;
Detailed floor plans of the building proposed for demolition;
Exterior elevations of the building proposed for demolition;
A report from a professional civil engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
on the structural soundness of the building proposed for demolition;
Photographs;
Historic overview of the building and/or property; and
A written description of the proposed use of the property.

The Zoning Officer shall forward completed applications for demolition, removal or relocation
of Class 1 and Class 2 historic resources to the Historical Commission. All information
submitted in compliance with the review criteria above shall be taken into consideration during
the deliberation process as shall the community goals and development objectives of the
municipality.
The applicant shall be provided an opportunity to present the proposal to the Historical
Commission at a regularly scheduled monthly meeting, subject to written advance notice.
The written recommendations of the Historical Commission shall be forwarded to the Board of
Supervisors for its consideration. It shall consider the review criteria, the written
recommendations of the Historical Commission and the community goals and development
objectives set forth in the Comprehensive Plan, and make its determination at a public
meeting which the applicant may attend.

person or event that has state or national significance.
Class 2. A building that contributes to the character and constitutes the fabric of the
community and/or that has local historical significance.
Class 3. A building that is old but has lost its integrity or a building that is less than 50 years
old is not an historic resource and is not regulated under the provisions of this chapter.
Changes in classification. Changes to any class shall occur only when in compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
Revisions to inventory and map. The Historic Resource Inventory and Map may be revised from
time to time by legislative action of the Board of Supervisors who will consider recommendations
from the Historical Commission following a public meeting at which time the proposed changes
shall be presented.
Revisions are defined as additions, deletions, or changes of classification. Revisions do not
include routine list maintenance to update ownership information or to add information about
a change that occurred to the building unless that change affects the classification.
The Historic Resources List and Map shall be reviewed no less than annually, and
recommendations for revisions, if any, shall be compiled by the Historical Commission and
submitted to the Board of Supervisors for its review and action.

If it appears to the municipality that a violation of this chapter has occurred, the municipality shall
initiate enforcement proceedings by sending an enforcement notice as provided in this section.
The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the parcel on which the violation
has occurred, to any person who has filed a written request to receive enforcement notices
regarding that parcel, and to any other person requested in writing by the owner of record.
In the event of demolition by neglect, the following special provisions shall apply:
Codes violations. If the Codes Enforcement Officer has cited a property owner for conditions
that could lead to structural weakness, decay or deterioration in a building or structure and the
property owner fails to correct the condition(s) in the time specified, that property owner may
be cited also for demolition by neglect under these provisions and be subject to the penalties
contained herein.
Owners of unoccupied principal or accessory buildings or structures cited for codes violations
shall develop a written maintenance program for the protection of any and all unoccupied
principal or accessory buildings or structures. Said maintenance program shall be established
in accordance with the Lancaster Township Property Maintenance Code. A copy of the
maintenance program shall be filed with the Codes Enforcement Officer and implementation
begun in accordance with an established timetable.
The maintenance program shall address measures to assure that structural components are
protected and reinforced to stabilize and maintain the essential form of the building or
structure. Structural features requiring stabilization include, but may not be limited to: roof;
chimney(s); cornice, soffit, fascia, spouting, columns, beams, posts, as well as window and
door sills, lintels and jambs.
The exterior and interior of the building or structure shall be inspected no less than annually
by the Codes Enforcement Officer with the owner or the owner's agent to determine
compliance with the established maintenance program.
An enforcement notice shall state at least the following:
The name of the owner of record and any other person against whom the municipality intends
to take action.
The location of the property in violation.
The specific violation with a description of the requirements which have not been met, citing in
each instance the applicable provisions of this chapter.
The date on or before which the steps for compliance must be commenced and the date on or
before which the steps must be completed.
That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board within a
prescribed period of time in accordance with procedures set forth in the chapter.
That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified, unless extended by appeal to
the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly described.
In any appeal of an enforcement notice to the Zoning Hearing Board the municipality shall have
the responsibility of presenting its evidence first.

Causes of action. In case any building, structure, landscaping or land is, or is proposed to be,
demolished, relocated or removed, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained or used in
violation of this chapter, the Supervisors or, with the approval of the Township Manager, the
Zoning Officer, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent, in or
about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation.
Enforcement remedies. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in a
civil enforcement proceeding commenced on behalf of the Township, pay a judgment of not more
than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a
result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor
timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless the district judge determining that there has been a violation further determines that there
was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the ordinance to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
district judge, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of zoning
ordinances shall be paid over to the Township.
In addition to the enforcement provisions found in the Lancaster Township Zoning Ordinance and
incorporated herein by reference, the Board of Supervisors may authorize action to withhold
issuance of any and all zoning and building permits for a period of up to three years for any
property that at the time of the enactment of these provisions was occupied by a building or
structure that was subsequently demolished, removed or relocated without obtaining a permit as
provided for herein.
The Board of Supervisors may take other appropriate legal action, which may include equitable
and injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of this chapter.

Reduce financial burdens imposed on the Township, its governmental units, and its residents by
preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
§ 160-3. Applicability.
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within Lancaster Township unless a
permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures.
§ 160-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that
those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this
chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 160-5. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas or that land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding
or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Lancaster Township or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Article III. Administration
§ 160-6. Designation of Floodplain Administrator.

structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the applicant, who sets
forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request
and the original permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the
extension is granted.

The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Lancaster Township classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated April 5, 2016, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of
the Flood Insurance Study.
The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments, are
hereby adopted by Lancaster Township and declared to be a part of this chapter.
§ 160-18. Description.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway and which
represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway
has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the Township during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed, unless the
appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA for which BFEs have been provided. The AE Area adjacent to the
floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which BFEs have been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
A Area/District.
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no BFEs have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall
be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the BFE shall
be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the municipality.
§ 160-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of Supervisors where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.

Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the Township shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 160-22B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 160-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be
made by Lancaster Township, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to
the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner. The property owner
shall pay all costs associated with the hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board, including all costs for
advertising public notice, for fees to Zoning Hearing Board members, for fees to the Township
Engineer and Township Solicitor, and for all stenographic records, including the attendance of a
stenographer and, when necessary, the transcription of the record.
§ 160-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the Township shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to
boundary changes. The Township shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Article V. Technical Provisions
§ 160-22. General requirements.
Alteration or relocation of watercourses.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action have been notified by
the municipality and until all required permits or approvals have first been obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
When an applicant proposes to permit the following encroachments: any development that causes
a rise in the BFEs within the floodway; or any development occurring in Zone AE without a
designated floodway which will cause a rise of more than one foot in the BFE; or alteration or
relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the applicant
shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the encroachments
to occur.
Upon receipt of the Floodplain Administrator's conditional approval of map change and prior
to approving the proposed encroachments, the applicant shall provide evidence to FEMA of
the adoption of floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased BFEs and/or
revised floodway reflecting the post-project condition.

accordance with 44 CFR 67.
Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within any identified floodplain area
shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
§ 160-23. Elevation and floodproofing requirements.
Within any identified floodplain area, any new construction or substantial improvements shall be
prohibited. If a variance is obtained for new construction or substantial improvements in the identified
floodplain area in accordance with the criteria in Article VIII, then the following provisions apply:
Residential structures.
In AE Zones, any new construction or substantial improvement shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated up to or above the regulatory flood elevation.
In A Zones, where there are no BFEs specified on the FIRM, any new construction or
substantial improvement shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated up to or
above the regulatory flood elevation determined in accordance with § 160-18C of this chapter.
The design and construction standards and specifications contained in the 2009 International
Building Code (IBC) and in the 2009 International Residential Code (IRC) or the most recent
revisions thereof and ASCE 24 and 34 Pa. Code (Chapters 401 through 405 as amended)
shall be utilized, where they are more restrictive.
Nonresidential structures.
In AE Zones, any new construction or substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated up to or above the regulatory flood
elevation or be designed and constructed so that the space enclosed below the regulatory
flood elevation:
Is floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water; and
Has structural components with the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy.
In A Zones, where no BFEs are specified on the FIRM, any new construction or substantial
improvement shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or completely
floodproofed up to or above the regulatory flood elevation determined in accordance with
§ 160-18C of this chapter.
Any nonresidential structure, or part thereof, made watertight below the regulatory flood
elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the W1 or W2 space classification
standards contained in the publication entitled "Flood-Proofing Regulations" published by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (June 1972, as amended March 1992) or with some
other equivalent standard. All plans and specifications for such floodproofing shall be
accompanied by a statement certified by a registered professional engineer or architect which
states that the proposed design and methods of construction are in conformance with the
above-referenced standards.

revisions thereof and ASCE 24 and 34 Pa. Code (Chapters 401 through 405 as amended)
shall be utilized where they are more restrictive.
Space below the lowest floor.
Fully enclosed space below the lowest floor (excluding basements) which will be used solely
for the parking of a vehicle, building access, or incidental storage in an area other than a
basement shall be designed and constructed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters for the purpose of equalizing hydrostatic forces on exterior walls. The term "fully
enclosed space" also includes crawl spaces.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two openings having a net total area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed space.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices,
provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Historic structures. Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined in this chapter must comply with all ordinance requirements
that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. Documentation
that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National
Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the
Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from ordinance
requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
Accessory structures. Structures accessory to a principal building need not be elevated or
floodproofed to remain dry but shall comply, at a minimum, with the following requirements:
The structure shall not be designed or used for human habitation but shall be limited to the
parking of vehicles, or to the storage of tools, material, and equipment related to the principal
use or activity.
Floor area shall not exceed 200 square feet.
The structure will have a low damage potential.
The structure will be located on the site so as to cause the least obstruction to the flow of
floodwaters.
Power lines, wiring, and outlets will be elevated to the regulatory flood elevation.
Permanently affixed utility equipment and appliances such as furnaces, heaters, washers,
dryers, etc., are prohibited.
Sanitary facilities are prohibited.
The structure shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement and shall be designed to automatically provide for the entry and exit of floodwater
for the purpose of equalizing hydrostatic forces on the walls. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following minimum criteria:

Where pursuant to Section 508(b)(1)(I) of Act 98 of 1992, the Municipal Treasurer issues a certificate
indicating that there are no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against real
property, the insuring agent shall pay the claim of the named insured, provided however, that if the loss
agreed upon by the named insured and the insuring agency equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the following procedures must be
followed:
The insuring agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Treasurer of Lancaster
Township in the aggregate $2,000 for each $15,000 of a claim and for each fraction of that amount
of a claim, this section to be applied such that if the claim is $15,000 or less, the amount
transferred to Lancaster Township shall be $2,000.
If at the time of a loss report the named insured has submitted a contractor's signed estimate of
the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure in the amount less than
the amount calculated as provided in Subsection A above, the insuring agent shall transfer to
Lancaster Township from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies, associations or exchanges
insuring the building or other structure.
After the transfer, the named insured may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure, and the Treasurer shall return the
amount of the funds transferred to Lancaster Township in excess of the estimate to the named
insured, if the municipality has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other
structure.
Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, Lancaster Township shall do the following:
The Treasurer shall place the proceeds in the separate fund to be used solely as security
against the total costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or structure which are
incurred by Lancaster Township. Such costs will include, without limitation, any engineering,
legal or administrative costs incurred by the municipality in connection with such removal,
repair or securing of the building or any proceedings related thereto; and
It is the obligation of the insuring agent when transferring the proceeds to provide Lancaster
Township with the name and address of the named insured. Upon receipt of the transferred
funds and the name and address of the named insured, certify that the proceeds have been
received by the Lancaster Township and notify the named insured that the procedures under
this subsection shall be followed; and
When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure have been completed in
accordance with all applicable regulations and orders of Lancaster Township and the required
proof of such completion received by the Treasurer, and if Lancaster Township has not
incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing, the fund shall be returned to the named
insured. If Lancaster Township has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the
building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain,
Lancaster Township shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured; and
To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by Lancaster Township pursuant to this
section and not returned to the named insured, such interest shall belong to the township. To
the extent that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest earned on such proceeds
shall be distributed to the named insured at the time that the proceeds are returned.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of Lancaster Township to recover any
deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit Lancaster
Township and the named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of
funds to the named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has
been negotiated.

§ 185-6. Variances and Noise Control Board.
Variances.
Authority. The Noise Control Board shall have the authority to grant variances, consistent with
the provisions of this section, after public hearing, upon application of any person who owns,
controls or operates any sound source which does not comply with the provisions or
standards of this chapter.
Application. The application shall state the standard or provision from which the variance is
being sought, the period of time and reasons for which the variance is sought, shall contain
information which demonstrates that bringing the sources of sound or activity for which the
variance is sought into compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable
hardship on the applicant and shall contain any other supporting information which may
reasonably be required.
Public notification. Public notice of an application and the date, time and place of the public
hearing to be held thereon for a variance shall be given by publishing notice thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Township and County of Lancaster at least once, not
less than three days prior to the scheduled public hearing and by, if practicable,
conspicuously posting the premises that is the source of the sound for which the variance is
sought.
Hearing. The Noise Control Board shall hold a public hearing to decide variance applications
presented to it. Any person who claims to be affected by allowance of the variance may
become a party to the hearing.
Review standards. In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Noise Control
Board shall balance the hardship to the applicant versus the adverse impact to the public
health, safety and welfare and shall consider at a minimum the following conditions:

The physical characteristics of the emitted sound;
The times and duration of the emitted sound;
The geography, zone, and population density of the affected area;
Whether the public health and safety is endangered;
Whether the sound source predates the receiver(s); and
Whether compliance with the standard(s) from which the variance is sought would
produce hardship without equal or greater benefit to the public.
Decision. The Noise Control Board shall render a written decision in granting or denying the
application for variance and, if denied, shall state the reasons therefor. The Board's decision
shall be made available to the applicant and any other person who requests it in writing. In
granting a variance the Hearing Board may attach reasonable conditions including, but not
limited to, placing a time limit on the permitted activity and/or establishing a time schedule
within which the source of sound or activity for which the variance was sought must be
brought into compliance with this chapter. Where the grant of a variance is conditioned, the
variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant.
Noncompliance with any condition of the variance shall terminate it and subject the person
holding it to those provisions of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity for
which the variance was granted. Variances may be granted for a period of up to one year. The
person obtaining the variance may reapply for additional variance periods under terms set
forth by the applicant and the Noise Control Board.
Appeals. Appeal from an adverse decision of the Noise Control Board shall be made to the
Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County.
Special variances. The Zoning Officer of the Township of Lancaster, or any member of the Board
of Supervisors of Lancaster Township, or their designee, may, upon application and guided by the
standards for review set forth in Subsection A(5), grant special variances for infrequent events or

violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of the violation by the district
justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be

restrain, correct or abate a violation or to prevent illegal use or occupancy of any structure,
building, sign, fence, parking lot, driveway, land or premises or to stop an illegal act, conduct
business, use or occupancy of a structure, building, sign or land in and about any premises.

a service line, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant for connection to obtain street opening
permits from this municipality, or highway occupancy permits from the Pennsylvania Department

at the cost and expense of the owner of the improved property to be served through such service
line.

discharge or cause to be discharged into the sewer system any of the following: stormwater;
surface drainage; ground drainage; roof runoff; subsurface drainage; cooling water; drainage from
tile fields; unpolluted process waters; and any other substance other than sanitary sewage or
allowable industrial waste. Without limiting the foregoing, this provision makes it illegal for any

such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to reduce objectionable characteristics or
constituents to within the maximum limitations provided for in the rules and regulations of the
Authority or to control the quantities or rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. Construction
drawings, specifications and other pertinent information relating to the proposed preliminary
treatment facilities shall be prepared by the owner, at his expense, and shall be submitted for the
approval of the Authority Engineer, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until
said approval is obtained in writing. Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided, the same
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner, at his
expense. In lieu of introducing untreated or partly treated polluted waters or industrial waste into
the sewer system, the owner of the premises producing such wastes may construct and operate,
at his expense, private waste treatment facilities with the effluent discharged to a natural outlet,
provided such facilities are constructed and operated in compliance with all requirements of the

installed or connected to the service line or any part of the sewer system, any device or system
designed to discharge any substance other than sanitary sewage or allowable industrial waste into

other persons to install or connect or permit to be installed or connected, a sump pump, gutter,
downspout or other device to conduct stream, storm, roof, ground, or surface water into the sewer
system; provided, however, floor drains and cellar drains may be connected to the service line or

be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner of such facility or
premises at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner of such facility.

commits an offense if such person denies the authorized enforcement agency or its
representatives reasonable access to the permitted facility or premises for the purpose of

demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article or that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder or to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the Township or the
commonwealth, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 209-41. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce
stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices.
The Township, through its authorized enforcement agency, will adopt requirements identifying best
management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage system, or waters of the Township,
commonwealth or United States.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his own
expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the storm drainage system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a facility or premises, which is or may be
the source of an illicit connection or illegal discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants into the storm drainage system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid
NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with an industrial or
commercial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 209-42. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning a facility or premises through which a watercourse passes, or such person's
lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the premises free of trash, debris,
excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the
flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard
to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 209-43. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding any other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility,
operation or a premises, or responsible for emergency response for a facility, operation or a premises,
has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in
illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage system, or waters of
the Township, commonwealth or United States, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure
the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall
notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the authorized enforcement agency within three business days of the phone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner
or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the
actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;
The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the
restoration of any affected property;

completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the owner or violator fail to remediate or
restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental
agency or a contractor selected by the Township and the expense thereof shall be charged to the
owner or violator.

time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the subject
premises and shall constitute a lien on the premises for the amount of the assessment.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall become liable to the Township by
reason of such violation. The assessment may be paid in not more than 12 equal payments.
Interest at the rate of 6% per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the 10th day
following the bill for such assessment until paid in full.
§ 209-48. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements
of this article. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article, the
authorized enforcement agency may petition the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County for a
preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further
violations or compelling that person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 209-49. Compensatory action.
In lieu of the enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this article, the
Township, through its Board of Supervisors or the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a
violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance
workshops, creek cleanup, and the like.
§ 209-50. Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement provisions and penalties provided in this article, any condition caused or
permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this article is a threat to the public health,
safety and general welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or
restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken by means of injunction or other appropriate relief by action at
law or in equity. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the right to issue restraining orders,
temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus or other appropriate forms of remedy or relief.

continues shall be a separate offense.
§ 209-52. Reimbursement of expenses.
The authorized enforcement agency and Township may recover all attorneys' fees, court costs and
other expenses associated with enforcement of this article, including sampling and monitoring
expenses.

§ 229-2. Statement of findings.
The Supervisors of the Township of Lancaster find that:
Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout
a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost
of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management and
flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
and threatens public health and safety.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health,
safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the Township and all the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater
controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES).
Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater issues.
Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) can contribute to
pollution of waters of this commonwealth.
Inadequate maintenance of stormwater best management practices (BMPs) causes loss of water
quality, flooding, and other problems.
A program of reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal stormwater
management facilities will be beneficial.
§ 229-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within Lancaster Township by
minimizing the damages described in § 229-2 of this chapter through provisions designed to:
Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations in PADEP Chapter 93,
to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating
activities that cause these problems.
Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
Maintain recharge of groundwater to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater
quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the Township and the
commonwealth.

Q.
The Township shall be notified 24 hours prior to infiltration tests being conducted so as to
provide an opportunity for the Township to witness the tests.
Stormwater discharge points onto an adjacent property shall comply with the following:
Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created, increased, relocated, or
otherwise altered without written notification of the adjacent landowner(s) by the applicant,
including the establishment of an easement. Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the
requirements of this chapter. If, in the opinion of the Township, a decrease in stormwater flow
rate or volume will cause adverse impacts to downstream properties, the applicant shall
mitigate such impacts.
Stormwater runoff from a project site shall flow directly into a natural watercourse or into an
existing storm sewer system. If neither of these is available, the applicant shall obtain an
easement from the downstream landowner(s) to allow the site's runoff discharge to reach a
natural watercourse or an existing storm sewer system through the easement. If an easement
is obtained, post-development flow characteristics must be similar to or better than the runoff
characteristics (spread, velocity, and peak rate) of the predevelopment flows. The easement
from the downstream landowner(s) shall permit a piped storm sewer system, an overland flow
system, or a combination of the two. The downstream system design shall conform to the
design requirements of this chapter.
When the applicant provides verification that the downstream landowner(s) refuses to grant
an easement at reasonable terms in the sole opinion of the Township, the site shall be
designed such that the discharge from the applicant's site shall be in a nonerosive sheet flow
condition. For all design-year storms, including the one-hundred-year storm, runoff from the
applicant's site shall flow onto the adjacent property in a manner similar to the runoff
characteristics (spread, velocity, and peak rate) of the predeveloped flow. The use of level
spreaders is prohibited.
Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one watershed to another unless the
watersheds are subwatersheds of a common watershed which join together within the
perimeter of the property, or both of the following apply:
The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak discharge (in conformance with the
requirements of the Act 167 Plan) onto adjacent lands; and
Drainage easements from the affected landowners are provided.
Unless an alternate design is submitted to the Township for review, and said design is prepared by
a licensed (in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) geologist or geotechnical engineer:
No stormwater facilities shall be placed in, over or within a distance that will impact the
following features:
Sinkholes.
Closed depressions.
Lineaments in carbonate areas.
Fracture traces.
Caverns.
Intermittent streams.
Ephemeral streams.

Bedrock pinnacles (surface or subsurface).
The minimum isolation distance from stormwater management facilities to the listed geologic
features shall be as follows:
One hundred feet from the rim of sinkholes or closed depressions.
One hundred feet from disappearing streams.
Fifty feet from lineaments or fracture traces.
Twenty-five feet from surface or identified subsurface pinnacles.
Stormwater runoff from any regulated activity shall not be discharged into sinkholes.
It shall be the applicant's responsibility to verify if the development is underlain by carbonate
geology. The certificate in Appendix C shall be attached to all stormwater management site
plans and signed and sealed by the applicant's qualified professional.[2]
Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
Whenever a stormwater facility will be located in an area underlain by carbonate geology, a
geological evaluation of the proposed location by a registered professional geologist shall be
conducted to determine subsurface conditions, including soil permeability, depth to bedrock,
subgrade stability, and susceptibility to sinkhole formation.
Impermeable liners may be used to reduce or eliminate the separation distances listed in
Subsection Q(1) and (2) above.
All stormwater runoff flowing over the project site shall be considered in the design of the
stormwater management facilities.
The calculated peak rates of runoff for stormwater originating on the project site must meet one of
the following conditions, for all watersheds flowing from the project site:
Match predevelopment hydrograph. Applicants and/or landowners are encouraged to provide
infiltration facilities or utilize other techniques which will allow the post-development onehundred-
year hydrograph to match the predevelopment one-hundred-year hydrograph, along
all parts of the hydrograph, for the development site. To match the predevelopment
hydrograph, the post-development peak rate must be less than or equal to the
predevelopment peak rate, and the post-development runoff volume must be less than or
equal to the predevelopment volume for the same storm event. A shift in hydrograph peak
time of up to five minutes and a rate variation of up to 5% at a given time may be allowable to
account for the timing effect of BMPs used to manage the peak rate and runoff volume.
Incorporating the volume control requirements as given in § 229-48 can be used as part of
this option.
Where the predevelopment hydrograph cannot be matched, the calculated peak rate of
stormwater runoff from the project site after development shall not exceed 50% of the peak
rate of runoff from the project site prior to development activities. Both the predevelopment
condition and post-development condition shall be calculated on all design storms (two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year storm events).
Applicants have the option to propose a regional stormwater management plan or participate
in a regional stormwater management plan developed by others. A regional stormwater
management plan may include off-site volume and rate control, as appropriate and supported
by a detailed design approved by the Township. A regional stormwater management plan
must meet all of the volume and rate control standards required by this chapter for the area
defined by the regional stormwater management plan, but not necessarily for each individual

Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from sedimentation and compaction during
the construction phase to maintain maximum infiltration capacity. Staging of earthmoving activities
and selection of construction equipment should consider this protection.
Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff from disturbed areas until the entire
contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has achieved final stabilization.
If structure foundations, basements, or other underground facilities (whether on-site or off-site)
would be affected by saturated soil due to a nearby stormwater management facility, detailed

§ 229-45. Methods of calculation of runoff.
Methods shall be selected by the qualified person based on the individual limitations and suitability of
each method for a particular site. The methods of computation used to determine peak discharge and
runoff shall be:
The Soil-Cover-Complex Method (as set forth in the latest edition of Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55, as published by NRCS, formerly SCS) may be used for all
detention facilities with a drainage area greater than or equal to 60 acres. This method is
recommended for design of stormwater management facilities and where stormwater runoff
volume must be taken into consideration.
The Rational Method may be used for drainage areas up to 60 acres. Extreme caution should be
used by the qualified person if the watershed has more than one main drainage channel, if the
watershed is divided so that hydrologic properties are significantly different in one watershed
versus the other, if the time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff volume is
an important factor. The combination of Rational Method hydrographs based on timing shall be
prohibited.
The Rational Method shall be used for all:
Collection facilities;
Conveyance facilities.
Any other method approved by the Township Engineer.
If the NRCS/SCS Method (also known as the "Soil-Cover-Complex Method") is used, the design
storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of discharge shall be obtained from the
Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, United States
Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National
Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland. NOAA's
Atlas 14 can be accessed at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/pa pfds.html.
Provide the rainfall used for the two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twentyfour-
hour storm events. Rainfall values vary throughout the county depending on location.

Provide the location (longitude and latitude) or a description of the location for which the
rainfall applies.
If rainfalls from more than one location are used, provide the methodology by which the
design rainfall was calculated.
If the SCS Method is used, Antecedent Moisture Condition 1 is to be used in areas of carbonate
geology, and Antecedent Moisture Condition 2 is to be used in all other areas. A Type II
distribution shall be used in all areas.
If the Rational Method is used, the NOAA Atlas 14 data (see § 229-45E) shall be used to
determine the rainfall intensity in inches per hour based on the information for the five- through
sixty-minute duration storm events.
Hydrographs may be obtained from NRCS methods such as TR-55, TR20, or from use of the
"modified" or "unit hydrograph" rational methods. If "modified" or "unit hydrograph" rational
methods are used, the ascending leg of the hydrograph shall have a time of three times the time
of concentration (3xTc), and the descending leg shall have a time of seven times the time of
concentration (7xTc) to approximate an NRCS/SCS Type 2 hydrograph.
Runoff coefficients "C" and curve numbers "CN" shall be based on the charts contained in
Appendix B.[1]
Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
Times of concentration shall be based on the following design parameters:
Sheet flow: The maximum length for each reach of sheet or overland flow before shallow
concentrated or open channel flow develops is 150 feet. Flow lengths greater than 100 feet
shall be justified based on the actual conditions at each development site. Sheet flow may be
determined using the nomograph in Appendix B-4, or Manning's kinematic solution shown in
the sheet flow section of Worksheet No. 1 in Appendix B-5.
Shallow concentrated flow: Travel time for shallow concentrated flow shall be determined
using Appendix B-6 from TR-55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds.
Open channel flows: At points where sheet and shallow concentrated flows concentrate in
field depressions, swales, gutters, curbs, or pipe collection systems, the travel times and
downstream end of the development site between these design points shall be based upon
Manning's Equation and/or acceptable engineering design standards as determined by the
Township Engineer.
For the purpose of calculating predevelopment peak discharges, all runoff coefficients, both onsite
and off-site, shall be based on actual land use assuming summer or good land conditions.
Post-development runoff coefficients for off-site discharges used to design conveyance facilities
shall be based on actual land use assuming winter or poor land conditions.
Design of on-site conveyance system calculations may use the Rational Method of Q=CIA, where
Q is the peak discharge of the watershed in cubic feet per second, C is the coefficient of runoff, I is
the intensity of rainfall in inches per hour, and A is the area of the watershed in acres; or any other
method approved by the Township.
Runoff calculations shall include a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis indicating volume and
velocities of flow and the grades, sizes, and capacities of water-carrying structures, sediment
basins, and retention and detention structures and sufficient design information to construct such
facilities. Runoff calculations shall also indicate both predevelopment and post-development rates
for peak discharge of stormwater runoff from the project site.

Runoff calculations will also be made to ensure that the runoff from the upstream watershed area
can be accommodated by the pipes, drainage easements, watercourses, etc., on the site.
Peak rate control is not required for off-site runoff. Off-site runoff may be bypassed around the
site, provided all other discharge requirements are met. If off-site runoff is routed through rate
control facilities, runoff coefficients for off-site discharges used to design those rate control
facilities shall be based on actual land use assuming winter or poor land conditions.
§ 229-46. Design standards  water-carrying facilities.
All storm sewer pipes, grass waterways, open channels, swales and other water-carrying facilities
that service drainage areas within the site shall be designed to convey the twenty-five-year storm
event unless, in the opinion of the Township or Township Engineer, the character of development
and potential for damage warrant design for the fifty- or one-hundred-year storm.
Stormwater management facilities that convey off-site water through the site shall be designed to
convey the fifty-year storm event.
All developments shall include provisions that allow for the overland conveyance and flow of the
post-developed one-hundred-year storm event without damage to public or private property.
Conveyance facilities shall comply with the design criteria in the following table:

The minimum bottom slope of facilities not designed for infiltration shall be 1%. A flatter slope may
be used if an equivalent dewatering mechanism is provided.
If required, dewatering shall be provided through the use of underdrain, surface device, or an
alternate approved by the Township Engineer. If the facility is to be used for infiltration, the
dewatering device should be capable of being disconnected and only being made operational if
the basin is not dewatering within the required time frame.
Within basins designed for infiltration, existing native vegetation shall be preserved, if possible.
For existing unvegetated areas or for infiltration basins that require excavation, a planting plan
shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter and the BMP Manual.
§ 229-48. Design standards  volume control.
Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection
A below.
The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any size of regulated
activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
The post-development total runoff volume shall not increase for all storms equal to or less
than the two-year, twenty-four-hour storm event.
For modeling purposes:
Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be considered meadow in
good condition.
Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow
in good condition in the model for existing conditions.
The maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in karst areas shall be 3:1
impervious drainage area to infiltration area and 5:1 total drainage area to infiltration
area. The maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in non-karst areas shall be
5:1 impervious drainage area to infiltration area and 8:1 total drainage area to infiltration
area. A higher ratio would be acceptable if proper justification is submitted and approved.
Any portion of the volume control storage that meets the following conditions may also be used as
rate control storage:
Volume control storage that depends on infiltration and is designed according to the infiltration
standards in this chapter and the BMP Manual.
The volume control storage which will be used for rate control is that storage which is
available within 24 hours from the end of the design storm based on the stabilized infiltration

NOTES:
* Unless otherwise determined by professional geologic evaluation.
The facility shall be designed according to the BMP Manual to provide pretreatment to eliminate
solids, sediment, and other debris from entering the subsurface facility.
The facility shall be designed to provide a means of evenly balancing the flow across the surface
of the facility to be used for infiltration.
For facilities with the bottom less than five feet below the average grade of the ground surface, a
cleanout shall be an acceptable observation port. For facilities with the bottom five feet or more
below the average grade of the ground surface, a manhole or other means acceptable to the
Township shall be provided for access to and monitoring of the facility. The number of access
points shall be sufficient to flush or otherwise clean out the system.

The void ratio for design shall be assumed to be 40%.
Material consistency and placement depths for backfill shall be (at a minimum) per all applicable
pipe manufacturer's recommendations, further providing it should be free of large (not exceeding
six inches in any dimension) stone, rock, or other objectionable or detritus material. Select
nonaggregate material should be indigenous to the surrounding soil material for nonvehicular
areas. Backfill within vehicular areas shall comply with this section unless otherwise specified in
governing municipal road/street or subdivision and land development ordinances. Furthermore, if
the design concept includes the migration of runoff through the backfill to reach the infiltration
facility, the material shall be well-drained, free of excess clay or clay-like materials and generally
uniform in gradation.
Nonwoven geotextiles shall be placed on all sides of subsurface infiltration facilities.

Article VI. Administration
§ 229-55. Responsibilities of applicants and landowners.
The Township shall make the final determination on the continuing maintenance responsibilities
prior to final approval of the stormwater management site plan. The Township may require a
dedication of such facilities as part of the requirements for approval of the stormwater
management site plan. Such a requirement is not an indication that the Township will accept the
facilities. The Township reserves the right to accept or reject the ownership and operating
responsibility for any portion of the stormwater management controls.
Facilities, areas, or structures used as stormwater management BMPs shall be enumerated as
permanent real estate appurtenances and recorded as deed restrictions or conservation
easements that run with the land.
The operation and maintenance plans and agreements shall be recorded as a restrictive deed
covenant that runs with the land.
§ 229-56. Operation and maintenance agreements.
Prior to final approval of the development site's stormwater management site plan, the record owner of
the development site shall sign and record an operation and maintenance agreement covering all
stormwater control facilities that are to be privately owned. Said agreement, as provided in Appendix
F, is attached and made part hereto. The agreement shall stipulate that:
The landowner, successor and assignees shall maintain all facilities in good working order in
accordance with the approved maintenance schedule and shall keep all facilities in a safe manner.
The landowner shall convey to the Township easements and/or rights-of-way to assure access for
periodic inspections by the Township and maintenance, if required.
The owner shall keep on file with the Township the name, address and telephone number of the
person or company responsible for maintenance activities; in the event of a change, new
information will be submitted to the Township within 10 days of the change.
In the case of condominium and planned communities, separate agreements will be entered and
be in a legal form capable of being enforced against the common elements and the ownership
interests of the individual units or properties, as the case may be, so that the Township has the
ability to force compliance with the provisions of such agreements and to assess the cost (as set
forth in this chapter) against all owners so that the Township does not incur out-of-pocket
expenses.

The owner is responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) of the stormwater management
BMPs. If the owner fails to adhere to the operation and maintenance agreement, the Township
may perform the services required and charge the owner appropriate fees. Nonpayment of fees
may result in a lien against the property.
Where drainage facilities are approved within a state highway, a perpetual agreement or bond
shall be required of the applicant for maintenance of said facilities.
Where the NPDES permit for the project requires that BMPs be installed, annual written reporting
of the inspection and maintenance of those BMPs shall be included in the program.
§ 229-57. Performance guarantee.
A financial security (bond, restricted account or letter of credit) for stormwater-related
improvements shall be supplied by the applicant in conjunction with the subdivision/land
development approval, or in conjunction with the stormwater management site plan approval if no
subdivision/land development plan is required.
The applicant shall provide a financial security to the Township for the timely installation and
proper construction of all stormwater management facilities, as required by the approved
stormwater management site plan and this chapter and, as applicable, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 5 of the MPC.
As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial
security may request the Township to release or authorize the release of, from time to time, such
portions of the financial security necessary for the payment to the contractor or contractors
performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing and addressed to the Supervisors, and
the Supervisors shall have 45 days from the receipt of such request to allow the Township
Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Supervisors that such portion of the work has been completed
in accordance with the approved plan. Upon such certification, the Supervisors shall authorize
release from the required financial security of an amount as estimated by the Township Engineer
as representing the value of the work completed.
In the event that any stormwater management facilities which may be required have not been
installed as provided in the approved stormwater management site plan, the Supervisors are
hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and
equitable remedies. If proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the stormwater management facilities covered by
said security, the Supervisors may, at their option, install part of such stormwater management
facilities and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the monies necessary to
complete the remainder of the stormwater management facilities. All of the proceeds, whether
resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the applicant, or
both, shall be used solely for the installation of the stormwater management facilities covered by
such security and not for any other municipal purpose.
For stormwater management site plans that are required to have an NPDES permit and a financial
security to the Township is required, evidence of the NPDES permit's executed "notice of
termination" shall be provided to the Township prior to the release of the financial security.
Financial security shall not be finally released until an as-built plan, as described in § 229-61, has
been submitted to the Township and approved by the Township Engineer.
§ 229-58. Maintenance responsibilities.
Maintenance of stormwater management facilities shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

of BMPs, maintenance and care, as per Subsection B below.
All pipes, swales and detention facilities shall be kept free of any debris or other obstruction
and in original design condition.
Removal of silt from all permanent structures which trap silt or sediment in order to keep the
material from building up in stormwater management facilities and thus reducing their
capacity to convey or store water.
Mowing grass areas as necessary to maintain adequate growth and to control weeds.
Chemical weed control may be used to maintain the specified planting (i.e., grass, wetlands
plants, etc.) if federal, state and local laws and regulations are met.
Liming and fertilizing vegetated channels and other areas according to the specifications in
the PADEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Manual.
Reestablishment of vegetation by seeding and mulching or sodding of scoured areas or areas
where vegetation has not been successfully established. Selection of seed mixtures shall be
subject to approval by the Township.
Where the NPDES permit for the project requires that BMPs be installed, annual written
reporting of the inspection and maintenance of those BMPs shall be provided to the
Township. LID practices shall be included in the annual written report. A form for reporting
shall be available at the Township Office. Failure to provide such reports may result in
enforcement and penalties by the Township.
Stormwater management BMPs shall be inspected by the landowner, or the landowner's designee
(including the Township for dedicated and owned facilities), according to the following list of
minimum frequencies:
Annually for the first five years.
Once every three years thereafter.
During or immediately after the cessation of a ten-year or greater storm (equating to at least
4.5 inches of rainfall in a twenty-four-hour period).
The Township reserves the right to accept or reject any proposal to dedicate ownership and
operating responsibility of any stormwater management facilities to the Township.
§ 229-59. Maintenance of existing facilities/BMPs.
Stormwater management facilities existing on the effective date of this chapter, which have not been
accepted by the Township or for which maintenance responsibility has not been assumed by a private
entity such as a homeowners' association, shall be maintained by the individual landowners. Such
maintenance shall include, at a minimum, those items set forth in § 229-58 above. If the Township
determines at any time that any permanent stormwater management facility has been eliminated,
altered, blocked through the erection of structures or the deposit of materials, or improperly
maintained, the condition constitutes a nuisance; and the Township shall notify the landowner of
corrective measures that are required and provide for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30
days, within which the landowner shall take such corrective action. If the landowner does not take the
required corrective action, the Township may either perform the work or contract for the performance of
the work and bill the landowner for the cost of the work plus a penalty of 10% of the cost of the work. If
such bill is not paid by the landowner within 30 days, the Township may file a municipal claim against
the property upon which the work was performed in accordance with the applicable laws. The

basis for underground facilities and on a per-linear-foot basis for aerial facilities. If subject
to a cable franchise agreement, the utility shall not be required to remit both a cable franchise
fee amount and an annual right-of-way maintenance fee to the Township; such utility shall pay
the higher of the two fees to the Township. The annual right-of-way maintenance fee shall
apply also to abandoned lines not removed from Township rights-of-way.

Right-of-way use authorization required.
Right-of-way use authorization. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no non-PUCregulated
entity shall own, construct, operate and/or maintain facilities in any right-of-way of
the Township to provide or to enable others to provide services to persons or areas in the
Township or outside the Township without a right-of-way use authorization. The types of rightof-
way use authorization are a right-of-way use permit and a cable franchise. Public utilities
regulated by the PUC shall not be subject to this section and shall comply with the provisions
of this article.
Permit required. Pursuant to this article, all non-PUC-regulated entities that own, construct
and/or maintain facilities in any public right-of-way shall obtain a right-of-way use permit. If
any such entity is subject to a cable franchise agreement, the permittee shall not be required
to remit both a cable franchise fee and an annual right-of-way maintenance fee to the
Township. Such permittee shall pay the higher amount of the two fees to the Township.
Right-of-way use permit.
Permit required; term and scope of permit. No non-PUC-regulated entity, other than a
franchisee, may own, construct, operate and/or maintain facilities that occupy the right-of-way
without first obtaining a ROW use permit. Any ROW use permit shall be subject to such
conditions as the Township may from time to time establish and shall otherwise conform to
the requirements of this article and applicable law. A ROW use permit shall be for a term of
five years. A ROW use permit and the rights, benefits and permissions conferred thereby
shall apply to the entire geographic area of the Township.
Approval by Township. A ROW use permit shall be authorized only by the Township and shall
not become effective unless or until so authorized. In addition to the other requirements
contained herein, the applicant shall demonstrate:
That it has a history of compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the
management, construction and maintenance of facilities in streets and rights-of-way,
wherever located; and
That it possesses all licenses, permits, authorizations, and other permissions required by
the Federal Communications Commission, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
Township as a condition of its using the right-of-way and furnishing the services and
operating the facilities proposed by the applicant.
Insurance. Each permittee shall, at all times during the entire term of the right-of-way use
permit, maintain and require its contractors and subcontractors to maintain insurance with a
reputable insurance company authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and which has an A.M. Best rating (or equivalent) and no less than an "A"
rating, indemnifying the Township from and against any and all claims for injury or damage to
persons or property, both real and personal, caused by the construction, installation,
operation, maintenance or removal of permittee's system or facilities in the rights-of-way. The
amounts of such coverage shall be as determined by the Township by regulation. The
Township shall be designated as an additional insured under each of the insurance policies
required by this section. The permittee shall not cancel any required insurance policy without
obtaining alternative insurance in conformance with this section. The permittee shall provide
the Township with at least 30 days' advance written notice of any material changes or
cancellation of any required insurance policy.
Indemnification. Each permittee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Township, its elected and appointed officials, employees and agents, at all
times against any and all claims for personal injury, including death, and property damage
arising in whole or in part from, caused by or connected with any act or omission of the
permittee, its officers, agents, employees or contractors arising out of, but not limited to, the

construction, installation, operation, maintenance or removal of permittee's system or facilities
in the rights-of-way. Each permittee shall defend any actions or proceedings against the
Township in which it is claimed that personal injury, including death, or property damage was
caused by the permit holder's construction, installation, operation, maintenance or removal of
permittee's system or facilities in the rights-of-way. The obligation to indemnify, hold harmless
and defend shall include, but not be limited to, the obligation to pay judgments, injuries,
liabilities, damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable expert fees, court costs and all
other costs of indemnification.
Application for right-of-way use permit. Application for a ROW use permit shall be in such
form and shall include such information as the Township determines by regulation. Within a
reasonable period of time not to exceed 60 days after receiving a complete application
hereunder, the Township shall make a determination approving or denying the application.
Determinations to grant or deny an application shall be made on a nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral basis. If the application is denied, the written determination shall include
the reasons for denial. The application fee, which shall be paid at the time of the filing of the
application, shall be as fixed from time to time by resolution of Township Board of
Supervisors. The application fee shall be sufficient to reimburse the Township for the actual
costs of Township staff time and other resources that are required and may be adjusted by
resolution of Township Board of Supervisors.
Renewal of right-of-way use permit.
A person desiring to renew a ROW use permit prior to the expiration of the permit shall
file an application with the Township for renewal of its authorization, which shall include
the information and documents required for an initial application and other material
information required by the Township by regulation.
The Township shall make a determination accepting or denying the renewal application. If
the renewal application is denied, the written determination shall include the reasons for
nonrenewal. Determinations to grant or deny a renewal application shall be made on a
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral basis. The Township shall not unreasonably
delay or deny the issuance of a renewal permit.
As-built maps. Each person applying for a ROW use permit shall submit to the Department
two paper copies and one electronic copy of an as-built map or maps and engineering
specifications as set forth in the Policies and Procedures depicting and certifying the location
of all its existing facilities within the right-of-way. Such electronic and paper maps and
engineering specifications shall be submitted in a format and include the information required
by the Township by/in the policies and procedures and shall be submitted with the application.
If the maps are not provided electronically in the required format, then the person shall
reimburse the Township for the cost of converting paper maps into electronic form or the cost
of converting electronic maps in another format into the required format. After submission of
the as-built maps required under this section, each permittee having facilities in the Township
rights-of-way shall update such maps as required under this article.
Right to inspect. The Department shall have the right to inspect all of the facilities of the
permittee, including aerial facilities and underground facilities, to ensure health and safety
with respect to such facilities, other facilities, the rights-of-way and any other public or private
property and to determine compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable laws
and regulations. Permittees are required to cooperate with all such inspections and to provide
information requested by the Township as part of the inspection.
Use authorized. No ROW use permit shall confer any exclusive right or privilege to occupy or
use the right-of-way for any purpose; or explicitly or impliedly preclude or affect the
Township's right to authorize use of the right-of-way by other persons to own, construct,
operate, maintain, and/or provide the same or different facilities or services, or for any other
purposes as the Township determines appropriate; or affect the Township's right to construct,

operate or maintain any type of facilities itself or offer any type of services in the right-of-way;
or authorize or excuse any person from securing such further easements, leases, permits or
other approvals as may be required by applicable law or regulation to occupy and use the
right-of-way; or convey any right, title or interest in any right-of-way greater or other than an
agreement only to use and occupy the right-of-way for the limited purposes and terms
provided in the ROW use permit; or be construed as any warranty of title.
Owner's consent. No ROW use permit expressly or impliedly authorizes a permittee to
provide any services to, or install any facilities on, any private property without the owner's
consent or to use publicly or privately owned poles, ducts or conduits without a separate
agreement with the owners thereof for such use.
Substantially similar terms. ROW use permits and renewals entered into after the effective
date of this article shall contain substantially similar terms which, taken as a whole upon
consideration of all of its material terms and upon consideration of the nature of the services
to be authorized and other relevant characteristics of applicants, do not provide substantially
more or less favorable terms and conditions than those required of other permittees.
Transitional provisions.
Persons already authorized to use the right-of-way. Any non-PUC-regulated entity holding a
permit or other authorization from the Township to own, construct, operate, and/or maintain
facilities in the right-of-way to provide services may continue to conduct those activities
expressly authorized until the earlier of the following: i) the conclusion of the present term of
its existing authorization, or ii) 180 days after the date on which this article is amended,
provided that in the case of a cable franchise, such authorization shall continue until the
expiration of the current term of the cable franchise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
persons (with the exception of cable franchisees) shall apply for a superseding ROW use
permit pursuant to this article within 90 days after the effective date of the Chapter and shall
be subject to the terms and conditions of this article.
Pending applications. Applications for an authorization to occupy or use the right-of-way that
are pending on the date on which this article is amended shall be subject to this article. A
person with a pending application shall submit additional information to comply with the
requirements of this article and applicable regulations of the Township governing applications
within 30 days from the effective date of this article.
Operating without right-of-way use authorization. Any non-PUC-regulated entity that owns or
operates any of the facilities currently located in the right-of-way, the construction, operation,
or maintenance of which is not currently authorized but is required to be authorized under this
article, shall have 90 days from the date on which this article is amended to file one or more
applications for a ROW use authorization. Any entity timely filing such an application shall not
be subject to penalties for failure to hold such a ROW use authorization, provided that said
application remains pending. Nothing herein shall relieve any person of any liability for its
failure to obtain any permit or other authorization required under other provisions of this article
or Township ordinances or regulations, and nothing herein shall prevent the Township from
requiring removal of any facilities installed in violation of this article or Township ordinances or
regulations.
Cable franchise or open video system franchise.
Franchise required.
No person may own, construct, operate or maintain a cable system or open video system
within the Township, provide cable service over a cable system, or provide OVS service

To the extent permitted by law, facilities used to provide telecommunications service,
information service or any form of services similar to cable service or OVS service that
are also used to provide cable service or OVS service, shall be subject to this article and
shall also require a right-of-way use permit pursuant to this article.
Effect of authorization.
A cable franchise or an OVS franchise shall not confer any authority to provide any form
or type of telecommunications service or information service in addition to the cable
service or OVS service authorized by the franchise. To the extent permitted by law, a
separate right-of-way use permit pursuant to this article, in addition to the cable franchise
or OVS franchise, shall be required before any franchisee is permitted to use facilities in
the right-of-way to furnish any form or type of telecommunications service or information
service.
In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this article and a cable franchise
agreement or OVS agreement in effect on the effective date of this article, the provisions
of the cable franchise agreement or OVS agreement shall govern.
Alteration or modification of existing facilities.
Alteration or modification of existing facilities. The permittee must notify the Township upon
alteration or modification of existing facilities within the rights-of-way. The permittee must
additionally provide an updated facilities map if facilities have been removed from or added to
the rights-of-way.
Change in information. If there are any changes in information provided in the original permit
application, the permit holder has an obligation to notify the Township within 60 days of such
changes.
Construction in the rights-of-way.
Street opening permits. Except in the case of an emergency, no non-PUC-regulated entity
shall perform any street excavation in the rights-of-way without first obtaining a street opening
permit and paying a permit fee pursuant to Chapter 231 of the Township of Lancaster Code.
No person shall perform curb and sidewalk construction replacement or repair without first
obtaining a curb and sidewalk permit and paying a permit fee pursuant to Chapter 231 of the
Code. The procurement of a street opening permit shall only be necessary when the
proposed street excavation and/or construction affects Township streets; it shall not apply to
any construction or excavation activities on state roads.
Construction standards. All construction, installation, maintenance, and operation of facilities
in the ROW by non-PUC-regulated entities shall conform to the requirements of the following
publications, as from time to time amended: the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Publication Form 408, the National Electrical Code, and the National Electrical Safety Code.
In the event of conflict between the ROW Construction Standards and this section, this
section shall govern as of the effective date of this article.
Security. Each non-PUC-regulated entity performing construction in the ROW shall furnish to
the Township, at the person's expense, a letter of credit or other form of financial security, in
such form and in the amount as required by the Township consistent with the Policies and
Procedures and regulations of the Township. The security shall be a continuing obligation until
the completion of the construction as confirmed in writing by the Township. Non-PUC
regulated utilities that are performing ongoing projects or are pursuing multiple projects under
one permit shall post security as provided by this section, which shall be held by the Township
until final completion of all construction or maintenance activities to guarantee the proper
closing and restoration of Township streets, sidewalks or ROW.

Right to inspect facilities. The Township may inspect the construction or installation of the
facilities of any non-PUC-regulated entity, including both aerial and underground facilities, and
any construction or repair activity to ensure health and safety with respect to such facilities,
other facilities, the rights-of-way and any other public or private property, and determine
compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable laws and regulations. Entities
are required to cooperate with all such inspections and to provide information requested by
the Township as part of the inspection.
Recently constructed streets. No street opening permit shall be issued to cut any Township
street that was constructed, reconstructed or resurfaced fewer than three years prior to
application for a street opening permit, unless the applicant agrees in writing to overlay or
pave the surface of the street, from curb to curb and intersection to intersection, to the
satisfaction of the Department. The applicant shall pay all street degradation fees and comply
with all related requirements as prescribed in this article.
Relocation or removal of facilities. Within 60 days following written notice from the Township,
or such longer period as the Township determines is reasonably necessary or such shorter
period in the case of an emergency, a permittee shall temporarily or permanently remove,
relocate, change or alter the position of any facilities within the right-of-way, excluding those
underground, whenever the Department, consistent with applicable PUC regulations, shall
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary
under the following circumstances: the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
Township or other public improvement in the right-of-way; the operations of the Township or
other governmental entity in the right-of-way; vacation of a street or the release of a utility
easement; or an emergency as determined by the Township.
Coordination of construction activities. By March 1 of each year, or at such other time as the
Township and permittees may agree, each right-of-way use permittee shall provide the
Department with a schedule (including plans and projected start and finish dates for each
project) of its planned construction activities for the following year which may affect the rightsof-
way. The schedule shall depict all planned construction activities the permittee is
committed to perform within the year.
Damage to facilities or property. A permittee, including any contractor working for a permittee,
shall avoid damage to any facilities and/or public or private property. If any facilities and/or
public or private property are damaged by permittee, including any contractor working for the
permittee, the permittee shall promptly repair and restore such property within 10 business
days. The permittee shall utilize the Pennsylvania One-Call System prior to any disturbance
of the rights-of-way and shall adhere to all other requirements of the Pennsylvania
Underground Utility Line Protection Act.
Facilities maps. Each non-PUC-regulated entity issued a street opening permit shall submit to
the Township, not later than 30 days after completion of the permitted construction (or any
part thereof, if required by the Township) two paper copies and one electronic copy of as-built
map or maps and engineering specifications as set forth in the Policies and Procedures
depicting and certifying the location of the facilities constructed. Such engineering
specifications and electronic and paper maps shall be submitted in a format and include the
information required by the Township in the Policies and Procedures. If the maps are not
provided electronically in the required format, then the person shall reimburse the Township
for the cost of converting paper maps into electronic form or the cost of converting electronic
maps in another format into the required format. Such maps are exempt from public
disclosure under Pennsylvania's Right to Know Law, 65 Pa.C.S.A. § 708.
Field marking. Each permittee shall field-mark the locations of its underground facilities upon
request by other permittees, public utilities or the Township, consistent with the requirements

Compensation for right-of-way use. Occupancy of Township rights-of-way by any utility is
subject to the Township's right to fix annually a fair and reasonable compensation, which shall
be directly related to the Township's actual right-of-way maintenance costs.
Annual right-of-way maintenance fee. Each permittee that is not a franchisee, including
Township ROW permittees, shall pay an annual fee to the Township to compensate the
Township for its costs incurred in connection with the ongoing use and occupancy of the rightof-
way. The annual right-of-way maintenance fee shall be determined by the Township and
authorized by resolution of Township Board of Supervisors and shall be based on the
Township's actual ROW maintenance costs. The annual right-of-way maintenance fee shall
be fixed on a per-linear-foot basis for underground facilities and on a per-linear-foot basis for
aerial facilities. If subject to a cable franchise agreement, the permittee shall not be required
to remit both a cable franchise fee amount and an annual right-of-way maintenance fee to the
Township; such permittee shall pay the higher of the two fees to the Township.
§ 231-18. Remedies; violations and penalties.
Penalties.
PUC-regulated utilities.
In the event a public utility is found by the Township to have violated a PUC regulation,
standard, or order, then the Township may bring a complaint against such public utility
before the Public Utility Commission for violation of such regulation, standard, or order.
The Township may also notify the utility of the existence of any suspected violation of
PUC standards, regulations or order in order to obtain compliance by the utility.
In the event a public utility is found to have violated any other provision of this article that
is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the PUC, then such public utility shall be subject,
upon conviction thereof, to a fine not exceeding $300, for each and every offense,
together with attorneys' fees and costs, and, in default of the payment thereof,
imprisonment for not more than 90 days. A separate and distinct violation shall be
deemed to be committed each day on which a violation occurs or continues to occur. In
addition to an action to enforce any penalty imposed by this article and any other remedy
at law or in equity under this title, the Township may apply to a Court of Common Pleas
for an injunction or other appropriate relief at law or in equity to enforce compliance with
or restrain violation of any provision of this article which is not subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the PUC.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Township to commence or attempt
to commence prosecution of any PUC-regulated utility for a violation of any regulation,
standard or order of the PUC.
Non-PUC-regulated entities. Any entity not regulated by the PUC that is found by the
Township to have violated any provision of this article shall be subject, upon conviction
thereof, to a fine not exceeding $300, for each and every offense, together with attorneys'
fees and costs, and, in default of the payment thereof, imprisonment for not more than 90
days. A separate and distinct violation shall be deemed to be committed each day on which a
violation occurs or continues to occur. In addition to an action to enforce any penalty imposed
by this article and any other remedy at law or in equity under this title, the Township may
apply to a Court of Common Pleas for an injunction or other appropriate relief at law or in
equity to enforce compliance with or restrain violation of any provision of this article.
Determination of violation. In the event a determination is made that a person has violated any
provision of this article or right-of-way use permit, such person shall be provided written notice of
the determination and the reasons therefor. Except in the case of an emergency, the person shall
have 30 days to cure the violation. If the nature of the violation is such that it cannot be fully cured

within such time period, the Township may, in its reasonable judgment, extend the time period to
cure, provided that the person has commenced to cure and is diligently pursuing its efforts to cure.
If the violation has not been cured within the time allowed, the Township may take any and all
actions authorized by this article and/or Pennsylvania law and regulations.
§ 231-19. Revocation of permits.
Substantial breach. The Township reserves the right to revoke any right-of-way use permit without
a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance,
rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by a permittee
includes but is not limited to the following:
The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the
perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the Township or its citizens;
Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit;
The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is obtained or
unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated
on an order issued in accordance with the Township's inspection of the work.
Written notice of breach. If the Township determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule or any condition of the
permit, the Township shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation.
The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for renovation of the permit. The
Township, at its discretion, may place additional or revised conditions on the permit in the event of
a breach of the terms and conditions of the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving modification of the breach, the
permittee shall provide the Township with a plan, acceptable to the Township, to cure the breach.
Permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further,
permittee's failure to so contact the Township, or permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year.
Reimbursement of Township costs. When a permit is revoked by the Township, the permittee shall
reimburse the Township for the Township's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the
costs of collection and reasonable attorney's fees, incurred in connection with such revocation.
§ 231-20. Work done without permit.
Emergency situations.
Each permittee shall immediately notify the Public Works Superintendent for the Township of
any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The permittee may
proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency without first
obtaining a permit. Excavators' notification to Pennsylvania One-Call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the occurrence of the
emergency, the permittee shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated
therewith, and complete the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this
article for the actions it took in response to the emergency.

If the Township becomes aware of an emergency regarding a permittee's facilities, the
Township will attempt to contact the local representative of each permittee affected, or
potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the Township may take whatever action
it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
permittee whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
Nonemergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained
the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit
and, as a penalty, pay twice the fee for said permit, pay twice all the other fees required by the
Township, deposit with the Township the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way,
and comply with all of the requirements of this article.
§ 231-21. General provisions.
Proprietary information.
If a person considers information it is obligated to provide to the Township under this article to
be a business or trade secret or otherwise proprietary or confidential in nature and desires to
protect the information from disclosure, then the person shall mark such information as
proprietary and confidential. Subject to the requirements of the Right-to-Know Act of 2009, 65
P.S. § 67.101 et seq., as amended, and other applicable law, the Township shall exercise
reasonable good faith efforts to protect such proprietary and confidential information that is so
marked from disclosure. The Township shall provide notice to the person in the following
circumstances: i) if the Township receives a request for disclosure of such proprietary and
confidential information and the Township Solicitor determines that the information is or may
be subject to disclosure under applicable law or ii) if the Township Solicitor determines that
the information should be disclosed in relation to its enforcement of this article or the exercise
of its police or regulatory powers. In the event the person does not obtain a protective order
barring disclosure of the information from a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days
following receipt of the Township's notice, then the Township may disclose the information
without further notice to the person.
The Township may, but is not required to, waive or grant an exception to any of the provisions
of this article in the event of emergency or for other cause shown by the applicant which
would support such a waiver or exception.
Leased facilities. Subject to the provisions of this article and with prior written approval of the
Township, a non-PUC-regulated entity shall have the right to furnish any facilities for which it has
the applicable authorization to own, construct, operate and/or maintain in the right-of-way to
another person for the latter's use in constructing or operating its own facilities in the right-of-way,
provided that:
The entity furnishing its facilities to another shall first deliver to the Township notice that there
is a fully signed and executed lease, rental agreement, or other agreement with such other
person pursuant to which the facilities are to be furnished; and
The person to which the facilities are furnished shall comply with all of the requirements of
this article and other applicable policies and procedures.
Duty to provide information. Within 10 days of a written request from the Township, each permittee
shall furnish the Township with information sufficient to demonstrate the following: that the
permittee has complied with all requirements of this article; that all fees and taxes due the
Township in connection with the services and facilities provided by the permittee have been
properly paid by the permittee; and any other information reasonably related to the permittee's
obligations pursuant to this article.

Right to inspect records. The Township shall have the right, upon 30 days' written notice and
during normal business hours, to inspect all documents, records, maps and other pertinent
information maintained by the permittee that relate directly to the terms and conditions of this
article.
No substitute for other required permissions. No ROW use authorization or ROW use permit
includes, means, or is in whole or part a substitute for any other permit or authorization required
by the laws and regulations of the Township for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a
business within the Township or any permit or agreement for occupying any other property of the
Township.
No waiver. The failure of the Township to insist on timely performance or compliance by any
permittee holding a right-of-way use authorization shall not constitute a waiver of the Township's
right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that permittee or any other permittee
holding such a right-of-way use authorization. The failure of the Township to enforce any provision
of this article on any occasion shall not operate as a waiver or estoppel of its right to enforce any
provision of this article on any other occasion, nor shall the failure to enforce any prior ordinance
or Township Code provision affecting the right-of-way, any facilities, or any user or occupant of the
right-of-way act as a waiver or estoppel against enforcement of this article or any other provision
of applicable law.
Policies and procedures. The Township is authorized to prepare such written policies and
procedures consistent with this article as the Township deems necessary for the implementation of
this article. Such policies and procedures shall be prepared and promulgated by the Public Works
Superintendent and adopted by the Township.
Lancaster Township, its employees, authorized agents and representatives, shall be exempt from
the provisions of this Ordinance and the Policies and Procedures adopted and promulgated
hereunder.
Police powers. The Township, by granting any permit or taking any other action pursuant to this
article, does not waive, reduce, lessen or impair the lawful police powers vested in the Township
under applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.
Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this article is for any
reason held illegal or invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not render the
remainder of this article invalid.
When effective. This Ordinance shall take effect five days after enactment by the Board of
Supervisors of the Township of Lancaster as provided by law.

All proposed right-of-way and cartway widths shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 236,
Subdivision and Land Development, and any applicable ordinance of Lancaster Township, each
as amended from time to time.
In the case of reconstruction, adequate right-of-way shall be provided commensurate with the
proposed improvements and to the satisfaction of the Board.
All roads shall be constructed or reconstructed in accordance with these specifications unless a
waiver is granted by the Board of Supervisors as adopted by resolution by the Board. Said
specifications shall control the method of construction or reconstruction and types of materials

requirements of Chapter 236, Subdivision and Land Development.
Curb requirements.
All existing roads within the Township have been classified in Appendix 1 of this article as
arterial or collector roads.[1] Curbing requirements for all reconstruction shall comply with
one of the following:
Arterial and collector roads: vertical curbs in accordance with applicable PennDOT
roadway construction standards in the case of state roads and in accordance with
Appendix 2 of this article in the case of Township roads.[2]
Editor's Note: Appendix 2 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
Local roads: vertical curb or slant curb in accordance with Appendix 2 of this article.
Any classification of road which currently has curb: replace curb in like kind. The
Supervisors of Lancaster Township reserve the right to specify curb type where one
or more types of curb exist along a road segment or if other conditions exist which
make one type of curb more desirable than another.
Editor's Note: Appendix 1 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
A list of streets which are classified as arterial or collector streets is attached to this
article. All other streets are considered to be local streets.
Street and road widening standards. Where a proposed subdivision or land development (or the
expansion of an existing subdivision or land development, including a mobile home park) borders
or has direct access to an existing Township road, or where, because of the nature of the
proposed subdivision or land development, an existing Township road will be overburdened or
exposed to such increased traffic that the same may, in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors,
cause the existing Township road to be damaged beyond normal wear and tear or create a
dangerous condition, the Board reserves the right to require the landowner to improve (or to pay
the cost of improving) the existing Township road, including widening and curbing the same, so as
to enable said Township road to accommodate prospective increased traffic and facilitate fire
protection without causing damage beyond normal wear and tear and without creating a
dangerous condition. The Board of Supervisors also reserves the right to require the landowner to
dedicate additional right-of-way to the Township where such additional right-of-way is deemed
necessary for safety, storm drainage, road maintenance or utilities.

method of construction or reconstruction, type of construction or reconstruction and/or require the
utilization of any specific alternate where the physical characteristics of the land indicate that an
alternative method is preferable, where the roads or drainage facilities are to be constructed in a
commercial or industrial area, or where an existing Township road is being relocated at the request and
expense of the developer.
§ 231-30. Completion of improvements or guarantee thereof.
No plan application shall be finally approved unless:
The streets, bikeways, sidewalks, walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights, storm drains and
other improvements as required by the Board have been installed in accordance with this
article in the case of reconstruction or in accordance with Chapter 236, Subdivision and Land
Development, in the case of all construction proposed within a subdivision or land
development; or
Financial guarantees are submitted to the Board in accordance with the Municipalities
Planning Code[1] and Chapter 236, Subdivision and Land Development.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.

and driveways, shall be maintained on a daily basis to produce a safe and desirable condition.
Streets shall be kept free of dust, mud, stones, asphalt, and debris caused by or related to the
work. The contractor, in the case of reconstruction, and the developer, in the case of work
associated with a subdivision or land development, shall be responsible for ensuring that all
streets are kept clean of debris caused by or related to the work. The Township or its
representative may use funds held as financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the
cleanup activity if this work is not performed by the contractor or developer in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Township.
§ 231-31. Inspections.

This section describes the minimum construction inspection required for all projects. The level of
construction inspection shall be commensurate with the type of improvements which are
proposed.
At the time of initiation of construction or reconstruction, the developer shall notify Township
officials so that they may schedule the appropriate road, street or drainage facility inspections
during construction. The Township shall be notified, in writing, at least three days in advance of the
intended date of construction or reconstruction of the base so that the subgrade may be
inspected. At the time of this inspection, the subgrade should be proof-rolled and the proposed
crown and grade should be checked. It is recommended that a developer's/contractor's
representative accompany the observer when crown and grade are checked. Proof-rolling should
be performed with a fully loaded, tandem-axle dump truck. This inspection must occur prior to any
stone subbase being placed. In the event that more than seven days elapses between the time of
preparation of the subgrade and the installation of the base, or if weather conditions occur
between the time of preparation of the subgrade or any inspection thereof and the installation of
the base, even if less than seven days, which might reasonably affect the subgrade, the Township
shall inspect or reinspect prior to installation of the base. The Township shall be notified at least
two days in advance of the intended date of construction or reconstruction of the paved surface so
that the base course may be inspected. At the time of this inspection, the depth of subbase should
be checked after compaction, the subbase should be proof-rolled in the same manner as the
subgrade and the crown and grade should be checked again. This inspection must occur prior to
any binder or base course being placed. If more than six weeks elapses between the date of
inspection of the constructed base course and the construction or reconstruction of the paved
surface, a reinspection shall be required prior to the construction of the paved surface. At the time
of this inspection, the depth of the binder/base course should be checked, ambient temperature
should be monitored (this is important in early spring and late fall days when the temperature can
go below acceptable limits), the temperature of the bituminous materials should be checked (if
possible), and it is recommended that copies of the weight slips for each truckload be obtained.
The crown and grade shall also be checked again. This inspection must occur prior to the wearing
course being placed. At the time of this inspection, the guidelines for the placement and
compaction of the binder/base course shall be followed. Upon completion of construction or
reconstruction, the Township shall be notified so that the finished road may be inspected.
Following any inspection made, the Township shall provide a report of inspection to the developer
in writing within 48 hours. Irrespective of the results of inspection, any road or drainage facility
shall not be deemed accepted for dedication until compliance with the provisions of § 231-35.
If, after final inspection is made, deficiencies in the method of construction or reconstruction are
determined, the deficient work shall immediately be corrected by the developer. Lancaster
Township, at the developer's expense, may require tests of the road to determine whether the
road complies in all respects with the approved plans, as modified, if applicable.
The undertaking of periodic inspections by the Township shall not be construed as an acceptance
of the work during construction or reconstruction or as a final inspection of the construction or
reconstruction.
§ 231-32. Construction or reconstruction in accordance with
plans.
All roads and drainage facilities shall be constructed or reconstructed in strict accordance with the
approved plans, and no changes shall be effectuated unless the same receive the written authorization
of the Board. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Board may require changes during the
construction or reconstruction stage where on-site conditions, in the opinion of the Board, or its duly
designated representative, reasonably indicate that the adverse effect of stormwater runoff and/or the
adverse effect to the roadbed and/or road surface may be minimized by such changes. The Township
may limit the time or times within which construction may occur if the temperature or weather

B.
conditions create the reasonable probability that the construction or installation of the facilities will be
adversely affected thereby.
§ 231-33. As-built plan.
At such time as the construction or reconstruction of the road is found to meet all requirements of this
article and the approved plans, as modified, if applicable, the developer, prior to offering the road for
dedication, shall submit to the Board a Mylar as-built plan of the road and any stormwater drainage
facilities, which shall form a part of the permanent records of the Township. The plan shall be prepared
by using the approved final plan as a base plan and shall be made available to the Township prior to
the final inspection of the project.
§ 231-34. Maintenance of sidewalks.
[Amended 4-14-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-01]
In accordance with Article XXIV of the Second Class Township Code, landowners are responsible
for keeping all public sidewalks in repair within the lands of such owner. In this article, "repair"
means patching broken sidewalk panels and replacing sidewalk panels which are vertically or
horizontally displaced and includes removal of snow, ice, and debris.
It shall be the duty of all tenants or occupants of occupied properties, and the landowners or
agents in charge of unoccupied properties abutting on public streets in Lancaster Township, not
later than 48 hours after snow or sleet has ceased to fall, to clear, or cause to be cleared, a
pathway in the sidewalk in front of their respective properties in the event of snow and to cover the
sidewalk with cinders, sawdust, or similar snow and ice control materials in the event of ice and
sleet. Such pathway shall not be less than 24 inches in width and shall be thoroughly cleared of
snow and ice or covered with cinders, sawdust, or similar snow and ice control materials. Where
snow and ice are removed from the pathway, they may be placed or piled on the curb side of the
sidewalk, but they shall not be piled or placed in the gutter or the cartway.
§ 231-35. Dedication.
Refer to Chapter 236, Subdivision and Land Development, for dedication requirements.
§ 231-36. Reimbursement of plan review and inspection
expenses.
The Township shall be reimbursed by the landowner or developer for all reasonable expenses incurred
by the Township for review of the plan and any reports, supporting plans, supporting data, proposed
agreements relating to the maintenance of improvements or open space, deeds of dedication, plans for
roads and similar documents and for inspection of the road, street, drainage or other facility intended
for the benefit of the public. Such expenses shall include any actual fees charged by the Township
Engineer, the Township Solicitor and other professional consultants for the services performed and the
actual cost to the Township. In some circumstances, the review of plans or other documents and
inspection of improvements may be performed by personnel employed by the Township instead of by
the Township Engineer, Township Solicitor or other professional consultants. If those reviews or
inspections are performed by Township personnel, the developer or landowner shall reimburse the
Township for all reasonable and necessary charges incurred by the Township for work specifically
involving such land development plan or other project. When those reviews or inspections are
performed by Township personnel, the fee shall be $25 per hour. A minimum charge of $25 per hour
per person will be billed for the first hour or any portion thereof. Any time in excess of one hour shall be

B.
C.
billed at the same rate on a proportional basis. This charge shall be revised to reflect changes in the
cost to the Township of utilizing Township personnel to perform such reviews or inspections.
§ 231-37. Resolution of fee disputes.
If the developer or landowner disputes the amount of any review or inspection fee, the developer or
landowner shall, within 10 working days of the billing date, notify the Township Secretary in writing that
such fees are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the Township shall not delay or
disapprove any approval or permit relating to the land development due to the developer's or
landowner's dispute of the fees. Disputes shall be resolved as follows:
If, within 20 days of the date of billing, the Township and the landowner or developer cannot agree
on the amount of the expenses which are reasonable and necessary, then the Township and the
developer or landowner shall jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another professional engineer,
if the fee involves the engineer's fees, or another consultant, if the fee involves another
consultant's fees, to review such charges and expenses and make a determination as to the
amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
The professional engineer or other consultants so appointed shall hear such evidence and review
such documentation as to the professional engineer or other consultant, in his or her discretion, is
deemed necessary and render a decision within 50 days of the billing date. The developer or
landowner shall pay the entire amount determined in the decision immediately.
The fee of the professional engineer or professional consultant for determining the reasonable and
necessary expenses shall be paid by the developer or landowner if the amount of payment
required in the decision is equal to or greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment
required is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the Township shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer or other consultant. In all other situations, the Township and developer or
landowner shall each pay 1/2 the fee of the professional engineer or other consultants.
§ 231-38. Violations and penalties.
Any person, firm, or corporation, or the members of such firm or the officers of such corporation, who
or which shall violate any provision of this article shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a
fine of not less than $50 nor more than $600 and/or to imprisonment for a term not to exceed 30 days.
Every day that a violation of this article continues shall constitute a separate offense. All fines collected
for the violation of this article shall be paid to the Treasurer of the Township for the general use of the
Township. The Township need not accept any roads or drainage facility from any developer who has
been found guilty of violation of this article by a court of this commonwealth, whether of record or not of
record, as to whom there remains unpaid any penalty or costs for such violation.
§ 231-39. Equitable remedies.
In addition to all other remedies, any continued violation of this article may be abated by proceeding
against the violator in a court of equity for relief.

§ 236-101. Enactment; authority.
The Board of Supervisors of Lancaster Township, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, Act 247 of 1968, as reenacted and amended (MPC),[1] hereby enacts and ordains the following
chapter governing subdivisions and land developments within the limits of Lancaster Township.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 236-102. Jurisdiction; conflicts with other legislation; construal
of provisions.
The standards and requirements contained in this chapter shall apply as minimum standards for

regulation other than this Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, imposes more restrictive
standards and requirements than contained herein, such other standards and requirements shall
prevail. These other Township standards and requirements shall be subject to enforcement by the
agency assigned such jurisdiction by said ordinance, code, resolution, or regulation. Approval of a
plan by the Township shall not be construed as an indication that the plan complies with the other
Township standards or requirements.
In order that the actions of the Board of Supervisors under this chapter may be correlated with all
relevant data and procedures, the Board of Supervisors hereby designates the Lancaster
Township Planning Commission as the agency of the Board of Supervisors:
To which all applications relating to either preliminary or final approval of subdivision and land
development plans shall be initially submitted;
With which applicants shall hold all preliminary consultations relating to the plans;
Which shall make recommendations to the Board of Supervisors concerning approval,
disapproval, modification and conditions of approval of such plans; and
Which shall make recommendations to the Board of Supervisors concerning the interpretation
of and the granting of modifications to provisions and standards of this chapter.
With the exception of § 236-102D and E of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall apply
to and control all subdivisions and land developments whose plans have not been recorded with
the Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds, prior to the effective date of these regulations.
The provisions of this chapter shall not adversely affect an application for approval of a preliminary
or final plan which is duly and properly filed with the Township and the Lancaster County Planning
Commission (LCPC) and is pending action at the time of the effective date of this chapter, and in
which case the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in accordance with the provisions of the
governing ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application had been duly filed. When
a preliminary plan has been duly approved, the applicant shall be entitled to final plan approval in
accordance with the terms of the approved preliminary plan; however, if an application is properly
and finally denied, any subsequent application shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
If an applicant has received approval of a preliminary plan or final plan prior to the effective date of
this chapter, no provision of this chapter shall be applied to adversely affect the right of the
applicant to commence and complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance with
the terms of such approval within five years from the date of such approval. If there is any doubt
as to the terms of approval, the terms shall be construed in light of the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time when the application for such approval was duly
filed.
In accordance with the provisions of the MPC, regulations governing mobile/manufactured home
parks (and campgrounds) are set forth in Article VII of this chapter.
Municipal liability. The making of any administrative decision by the Township or any of its officials
or employees shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind of the
Township of the practicability or safety of any proposed or existing subdivision or land
development and shall create no liability upon or give rise to any cause of action against the
Township and its officials and employees. The Board of Supervisors, by enacting and amending
this chapter, does not waive or limit any immunity granted to the Township and its officials and
employees by the Governmental Immunity Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8541 et seq., and does not assume
any liabilities or obligations.

Article IV of this chapter.
Zoning Ordinance compliance required. Whenever the most recent version of the Lancaster

shall obtain such special exception, variance, or conditional use approval from the Township
Zoning Hearing Board or Board of Supervisors, as applicable, prior to the submission of the

§ 236-302. Preapplication review (sketch plan).
Applicants are strongly urged to discuss possible development sites and plan with the Township
staff, Township Engineer, and Lancaster Township Planning Commission prior to submission of
any plan. The purpose of the preapplication meeting or sketch plan review is to afford the
applicant an opportunity to receive the advice and assistance of the Township staff and Lancaster
Township Planning Commission. Submission of a sketch plan is optional and will not constitute
formal filing of a plan with the Township.
Preapplication plans and data procedure. Prior to the preparation and filing of a preliminary plan,
the applicant may submit plans and data, which shall be forwarded to the Lancaster Township
Planning Commission for consideration. The plans shall include those elements that should be
considered in the design of the subdivision or land development.
Submission of preapplication (sketch) plans. Prospective applicants submitting a preapplication
plan for review by the Lancaster Township Planning Commission shall include those items listed in
§ 236-401 of this chapter. Plans shall be considered for informal review and discussion and shall
not constitute formal filing of the plan with the Township. Plans shall be submitted at least 30 days
prior to the regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the Lancaster Township Planning Commission
in order to be considered at the next regular meeting of the Lancaster Township Planning
Commission. All plan submittals shall be accompanied by a completed application (see Appendix
No. 9) and the corresponding fees.[1] The applicant may proceed to the preliminary plan process
following the meeting with the Lancaster Township Planning Commission.
Editor's Note: Appendixes are included as attachments to this chapter.
§ 236-303. Formal application.
All applications for approval of a subdivision plan, a land development plan, or an improvement
construction plan shall be made by the developer filing a completed application (see Appendix No. 9 or
10), together with the appropriate plans, studies, reports, supporting data, and required filing fee, with
the Township.
§ 236-304. Acceptance for filing.
Initial application. The Township shall have seven days from the date of submission of an
application to check the plans and documents to determine if, on their face, they are in proper
form and contain all information required by this chapter. If defective, the application will be
returned, within 15 days of the filing, to the applicant with a statement of rejection; otherwise, it
shall be deemed accepted for filing as of the date of submission. Acceptance for filing shall not,
however, constitute a waiver of any deficiencies or irregularities. The applicant may appeal a
decision by the Township under this section to the Board of Supervisors.
Amendments or corrections to an application.
The Township shall have seven days from the date of resubmission to check an amended or
corrected application's plans and documents refiled by the applicant to determine if, on its
face, the amended or corrected application is in proper form and contains all information
required by this chapter, whether such amended or corrected application results in a
substantial amendment, or whether such amended or corrected application constitutes a new

plan shall then be submitted by the Lancaster Township Planning Commission, together
with its analysis and recommendations, including those of the Township staff and
Township Engineer, to the Board of Supervisors. Generally, the plan will not be forwarded
to the Board of Supervisors until it has been recommended for unconditional approval.

The applicant shall submit a feasibility report concerning the availability of a public water
system in or near the proposed land development. Said report shall be prepared by an
engineer qualified to perform such duties and be submitted in conjunction with the plan for
review by the Township, the applicable authority, and for recommendations by the local office
of PA DEP.
Within any UGA or VGA or within any area that the Act 537 Plan identifies to be served
by public utilities, any lot created, and any land development plan that proposes to
increase flows equal to or greater than 400 gallons per day, shall be served by public
water.
For those areas not located within an UGA or VGA or within any area that the Act 537
Plan identifies to be served by public utilities, the feasibility report is not required for
residential subdivisions of four lots or less, including remaining lands and commercial or
industrial land development plans with a flow rate demand of less than 400 gallons per
day.
If connection to an existing public water system is proposed, the developer shall submit an
agreement which verifies the commitment of the public water provider to provide water as will
be utilized by the subdivision or land development for such period of time and under such
terms and conditions determined acceptable to the provider.
If the water supply system proposed involves the utilization of water obtained from the tract
being subdivided or developed (irrespective of whether or not that water is being distributed
as a part of a community water supply system), that water supply source may be utilized only
when:
The feasibility study establishes and the engineer qualified to perform such duties
performing the study certifies that the groundwater recharge on the tract in question after
development will exceed the anticipated water usage figures under the following PA DEP
standards:
A population of 3 1/2 persons per dwelling unit shall be assumed for residential units.
An average daily usage of 100 gallons per person per day is to be used where
residential use is contemplated.
Groundwater supply will exceed projected water usage quantities where industrial,
agricultural or commercial use is contemplated.
The Township Engineer recommends the study for approval.
When industrial, agricultural or commercial use is intended, the applicant shall, in the
feasibility study, set forth the proposed nature of the use, the proposed number of employees
and whether or not water will be used for cleanup and/or processing or otherwise in
connection with the use. The applicant shall in addition set forth the proposed allocation of
available water supply between or among the proposed uses and shall set forth a plan or
proposal pursuant to which such allocation can reasonably be monitored and enforced by the
Township or applicable authority.
In all cases the applicant shall demonstrate that the water to be supplied shall be of an
adequate quality and quantity for the intended use. Potable water shall meet all applicable
standards of PA DEP or the USEPA.

per day.
If connection to an existing public sewer system is proposed, the developer shall submit an
agreement which verifies the commitment of the public sewer service provider to provide such
sewage disposal as will be utilized by the subdivision or land development for such period of
time and under such terms and conditions as determined acceptable to the provider.
As a part of the feasibility study, the applicant shall state the type of sewage disposal desired
for each of the proposed lots. If other than connection to a public sewer system or the
installation of a conventional on-site sewage disposal system is intended on any of the lots,
that fact shall be indicated on the plan itself. The following conditions shall apply:
The Board of Supervisors will approve on-lot sewage disposal systems only when the
Township SEO shall certify that both an initial location and a replacement location for the
on-lot sewage disposal system are present on each lot.
The replacement location shall be of a size and capacity to allow complete
abandonment of the initial system in the event of failure.
The replacement location shall be protected from traffic, and no filling or excavation
shall be allowed within its boundary.
The standards for installation of the replacement system shall be as required by PA
DEP at the time of its construction.
Subdivisions proposing a lot or lots utilizing alternate on-site sewage disposal systems
will not be approved by the Board of Supervisors unless:
The Township SEO and/or a sanitarian of PA DEP certifies that a conventional
sewage disposal site cannot reasonably be located on the site; and
The lot itself cannot reasonably be redesigned or relocated consistent with the most
recent version of the Lancaster Township Zoning Ordinance,[1] as amended, and

§ 236-406. Traffic impact study.
There are two types of required traffic impact studies.
Studies required.
Abbreviated traffic impact study. Whenever a proposed development project will generate 50
to 99 new vehicle trips in the peak direction (inbound or outbound) during the site peak traffic
hour, the applicant shall perform an abbreviated traffic impact study. The study must utilize trip
generation rates from the most recent version of the ITE Trip Generation Manual or from a
local study of corresponding land uses and quantities. Based on this study, certain
improvements may be identified as necessary to provide safe and efficient access to the
development. The abbreviated traffic impact study shall include:
A capacity analysis report prepared under the supervision of a transportation engineer or
transportation planner, qualified to perform such duties.
The study area for the capacity analysis report shall only include all proposed site access
intersections.
Comprehensive traffic impact study. Whenever a proposed development project will generate
100 or more new vehicle trips in the peak direction (inbound or outbound) during the site peak
traffic hour or generate an ADT of greater than 3,000, the applicant shall perform a
comprehensive traffic impact study. Based on this study, certain improvements may be
identified as necessary to provide safe and efficient access to the development. In addition, a
comprehensive traffic impact study shall be prepared at the discretion of the Township
whenever either of the following conditions exist within the impact study area:
Current traffic problems exist in the local area or neighborhood, including but not limited
to a high crash location, confusing intersection, or a congested intersection that directly
affects access to the development.
The ability of the existing roadway system to handle increased traffic or the feasibility of
improving the roadway system to handle increased traffic is limited.
If access is proposed to a state roadway, the traffic impact study shall be prepared in
accordance with and shall conform to the most recent version of PennDOT Publications
and Procedures for Transportation Impact Studies, Publication 46, Traffic Engineering
Manual.
Traffic impact study requirements.
The traffic impact study shall be prepared in accordance with PennDOT Publications and
Procedures for Transportation Impact Studies, Publication 46, Traffic Engineering Manual,
and Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) recommended practice "Transportation Impact
Analyses for Site Development."
Area and scope of traffic impact study. The traffic impact study area and scope shall be based
on the characteristics of the surrounding area and the impact of the plan on the area. The
intersections to be included in the study shall be adjacent to the site or have direct impact
upon the access to the site. Prior to initiation of the study, the area and scope shall be
mutually agreed upon between the Township Engineer and the traffic engineer preparing the
study.
Preparation by transportation engineer required. The traffic impact study shall be prepared by
a professional engineer registered in Pennsylvania with specific training in traffic and
transportation engineering, at least four years of experience related to preparing traffic studies

for existing or proposed developments, and sufficient prior traffic study experience to qualify
the engineer to render any opinions and recommendations in the study.
Horizon year. The traffic forecasts shall be prepared for the anticipated opening year of the
development, assuming full build-out and occupancy. The horizon year in the remainder of
this chapter and shall be a minimum of five years after the opening year.
Traffic data, projections and analysis periods.
Traffic data used in the study shall not be more than one-year old.
Estimates of nonsite traffic shall be made and will consist of traffic generated by all other
developments within the study area for which preliminary and/or final plans have been
approved and traffic from background traffic growth in and around the study area. Traffic
generated by other development for which an application has been submitted but not yet
approved shall be included at the discretion of the Township. Nonsite traffic may be
estimated using the "build-up" technique or by way of area transportation plan data or
modeled volumes. Background growth compounded annually shall be established using
the growth rates from PennDOT.
Analyses shall be conducted for the a.m. and p.m. peak-hour periods. If the study area
includes an intersection on an arterial roadway or if the proposed development includes
retail related uses, then the Saturday peak-hour period shall also be analyzed. Where the
peak hour of the generator does not coincide with the peak hour of the adjacent street,
then the peak hour(s) of the generator shall also be analyzed.
Trip generation rates required.
The traffic impact study shall include a table showing the land uses and codes as defined
by ITE and quantities of each land use, with the corresponding trip generation rates or
equations (with justification for selection of one or the other), and resulting number of
trips, including entering, exiting and total trips. The trip generation rates used must be
either from the latest edition of Trip Generation by ITE or from a local study of
corresponding land uses and quantities. All sources must be referenced in the study. The
anticipated types and volumes of truck traffic using the site shall be identified.
All trip generation calculations shall be based on the methodologies as published in ITE's
"Trip Generation Handbook" or as mutually agreed between the Township Engineer and
the traffic engineer preparing the study.
Consideration of pass-by or shared trips. If pass-by trips or shared trips are a major
consideration for the land use in question, calculations of pass-by and/or shared trips
shall be based on published rates as identified in ITE's "Trip Generation Handbook."
Rate sums. Any significant difference between the sums of single-use rates and
proposed mixed-use estimates must be justified in the study.
Explanations required. The reasoning and data used in developing a trip generation rate
for special/unusual generators must be justified and explained in the study.
Definition of influence area.
Prior to trip distribution of site-generated trips, an influence area must be defined, which
contains 80% or more of the trip ends that will be attracted to the development. A market
study may be used to establish the limits of an influence area, if available. If no market
study is available, an influence area shall be determined based on a reasonably defined
market area. The influence area may also be based on a reasonable maximum
convenient travel time to the site, or delineating area boundaries based on locations of
competing developments.

Other methods, such as using trip data from an existing development with similar
characteristics, or using an existing origin-destination survey of trips within the area, may
be used in place of the influence area to delineate the boundaries of the impact.
Estimates of trip distribution required.
Trip distribution shall be estimated using analogy, trip distribution model, or surrogate
data.
Whichever method is used, trip distribution must be estimated and analyzed for the
horizon year and must be justified in the study. A multi-use development may require
more than one distribution and coinciding assignment for each phase (e.g., residential
and retail phases on the same site). Consideration must also be given to whether
inbound and outbound trips will have similar distributions.
The methodology for determining trip distribution shall be mutually agreed upon between
the Township Engineer and the traffic engineer preparing the study.
Trip assignments.
Assignments must be made considering logical routings, available roadway capacities,
left turns at critical intersections, and projected (and perceived) minimum travel times. In
addition, multiple paths shall often be assigned between origins and destinations to
achieve realistic estimates, rather than assigning all of the trips to the route with the
shortest travel time. The assignments must be carried through the external site access
points and, in projects producing 500 or more additional peak direction trips to or from the
site during the development's peak hour, through the internal roadways. When the site
has more than one access driveway, logical routing and possibly multiple paths shall be
used to obtain realistic driveway volumes. The assignment shall reflect conditions at the
time of the analysis. Assignments may be accomplished either manually or with
applicable computer models.
If a thorough analysis is required to account for pass-by trips, such analysis shall
determine the percentage of pass-by trips in the total trips generated using methodology;
estimate a trip distribution for the pass-by trips; perform two separate trip assignments,
based on the new and pass-by trip distributions; and combine the pass-by and new trip
assignment.
Upon completion of the initial site traffic assignment, the results shall be reviewed to
determine if the volumes appear logical, given characteristics of the road system and trip
distribution. Adjustments shall be made if the initial results do not appear to be logical or
reasonable.
The methodology for determining trip assignments shall be mutually agreed upon
between the Township Engineer and the traffic engineer preparing the study.
Total traffic impacts. Traffic estimates for any site with current traffic activity shall reflect
not only new traffic associated with the site's redevelopment but also the trips subtracted
from the traffic stream because of the removal of a land use. The number of trips to be
subtracted for the existing use shall be based on actual counts. The traffic impact study
shall clearly depict the total traffic estimate and its components.
Analysis.
Traffic analyses shall be completed for the existing conditions and opening day/build-out
year and horizon year, both without and with development. Analyses may consider
proposed roadway improvements only if said improvements have committed funding.

Capacity analysis shall be performed at each of the major street and project site access
intersection locations (signalized and unsignalized) within the study area. In addition,
analyses shall be completed for roadway segments, deemed sensitive to site traffic within
the study area. These may include such segments as weaving sections, ramps, internal
site roadways, parking facility access points, and reservoirs for vehicles queuing off site
and on site. Other locations may be deemed appropriate depending on the situation.
The recommended level of service analysis procedures detailed in the most recent
edition of the Highway Capacity Manual shall be followed. The operational analyses in
the Highway Capacity Manual should be used for analyzing existing conditions, traffic
impacts, access requirements, or other future conditions for which traffic, geometric and
control parameters can be established.
Where a Level of Service (LOS) "F" results, the associated delay shall be noted in the
study. Existing peak-hour factors and site-specific truck and roadway grade percentages
shall be utilized.
Traffic signal warrant analyses evaluating all warrant criteria shall be completed for each
unsignalized intersection which is shown to have an approach operating at an LOS "E" or
"F."
Where traffic signals exist or are proposed, analyses of the need for signalized left-turn
phases shall be completed in accordance with PennDOT Publication 149.
Queue length analyses shall be completed for each lane group. The need for
acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be presented in the study. The need for rightand
left-turn lanes shall also be evaluated. For both signalized and unsignalized
intersections, PennDOT Publication 46 shall be used as the basis for determining the
need and required lengths for said lanes.
Accident data for the most recent three-year period shall be presented and analyzed for
trends, type of accidents and causation factors.
Required levels of service. The study shall identify the improvements necessary to meet
the goals thereof and the applicant shall be responsible to make all improvements
required by law.
§ 236-407. Wetlands study.
The applicant shall submit a wetland study in duplicate with the submittal of all subdivision and
land development plans, if wetlands are present on the site. The purpose of the study shall be to
determine the extent of wetlands on the site.
The study shall be performed by a wetland scientist.
Requirements for wetland studies.
Delineations shall follow the procedures outlined in the version of the USACE's Wetlands
Delineation Manual, as amended and approved by the USACE for use, including any
supplements also so approved by the USACE for use.
Delineations shall be supported by reports. The report shall contain the following sections:
Introduction. Description of the physical features of the site, its location and the proposed
plans for the site.

Methods. Description of the methods used for the study. Relevant information includes
the date of the field investigation, the number of transects and sampling points used, the
size of vegetation quadrants employed, the size of soil pits used, and taxonomic
references.
Results and discussion. Description of the findings of the study. Soils, vegetation and
hydrology for wetland and upland areas of the site shall be discussed. Any problem areas
shall be thoroughly studied and discussed.
Conclusions. The extent of wetlands on the site shall be discussed. The impact of the
proposed project on these wetlands shall also be considered.
Included in the report as appendixes or tables shall be:
Site location map (USGS 7.5 feet quadrangle will suffice).
NWI map.
Soil survey map with soil descriptions.
Data sheets for each sampling point.
Wetland Boundary Map. Wetland boundaries shall be surveyed and shown on a map (or
drawing) of appropriate scale. The limits of the wetland study area shall be clearly shown.
The map shall also show the location of all sampling points used in the study, the date of
the delineation, and the name of the consulting firm which performed the delineation.
Color photos of wetland areas on the site, with locations and directions of view keyed to
the Wetland Boundary Map.
Resumes of the wetland scientist(s) who performed the delineation.
For sites on which no wetlands occur, an abbreviated report may be submitted. The
abbreviated report shall contain the introductory material, the methods section and a
discussion of the result of the study. Site location, NWI and soil maps shall also be provided.
All plans shall contain notes for future lot owners. The wetland boundary on each lot shall be
clearly marked. Each lot which contains wetlands, or to which access may be restricted by
wetlands, shall have a note which states: "State and Federal laws require permits for all
activities which result in a deposition of fill into delineated wetlands. Refusal of such a permit
may restrict some uses of all or portions of the lot."
Compensatory mitigation projects required as part of state or federal permits shall be shown
on the subdivision plans. Future lot owners whose property encompasses all or part of a
mitigation area shall be notified that the portion of their property which includes the mitigation
area may not be altered and is considered a regulated wetland by the state and federal
governments. Since lot owners may be responsible for maintenance of mitigation areas and in
order to help ensure the long-term viability of wetland mitigation efforts, the Township
discourages multiple ownership of mitigation areas. Ownership by one individual or a
homeowners' association is encouraged. Owners of the wetland mitigation areas must be
clearly identified to the Township. Mitigation areas need to be contained within an easement
meeting the requirements of § 236-605 of this chapter as it relates to drainage facilities with

disagree with the Township's delineation, a jurisdictional delineation by USACE will be
requested. Any charges for the jurisdictional delineation shall be the responsibility of the
developer.
Where the study shows the existence of wetland areas, the delineated boundary shall be
properly fenced off to prevent encroachment. Snow fence or other acceptable material shall
be used (the use of silt fence is not acceptable). The fence shall be properly installed, at a
minimum distance of five feet outside the delineated boundary, prior to any construction or
issuance of building permits. The fence must be properly maintained until all occupancy
permits have been issued and/or for the extent of all construction.
Article V. Improvement Construction Assurances
§ 236-501. Completion of improvements or guarantee thereof
prerequisite to final plan approval.
No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plan have been improved as
may be required by this chapter, and any walkways, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire
hydrants, shade trees, landscaping, water mains, sanitary sewers, stormwater management
facilities, recreational facilities, survey monument and lot line markers, or other improvements as
may be required by this chapter have been installed in accordance with this chapter, except that
the surface course of streets shall not be completed until such time as 90% of the lots in the
subdivision or land development have been improved by the construction of a dwelling if approved
for residential development or by the construction of the proposed commercial or industrial
structures if the lots are approved for such uses.
In lieu of completion of the surface course of streets as well as in lieu of completion of other
improvements required as a condition for final plan approval of a plan, and at the discretion of the
developer, such developer may deposit with the Township and/or the applicable authority, as
applicable, a letter of credit or other financial security authorized by the MPC and acceptable to
the Board of Supervisors and/or the applicable authority in an amount equal to 110% of the
estimated cost of the required improvements at a time 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion of the respective improvements by the developer. The estimated cost of the surface
course shall be computed separately from the estimated cost of completing the other
improvements and shall be based upon the developer's projected timetable for completion of the
development.
The amount of financial security required by the Township shall be based upon an estimate of the
cost of the improvements, submitted by a developer and prepared by an engineer qualified to
perform such duties and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such
cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to accept
such estimate for good cause shown. If the developer and the Township are unable to agree upon
an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another engineer qualified
to perform such duties and chosen mutually by the Township and the developer. The estimate
certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final
estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer
shall be paid equally by the Township and the developer.
Annually the Township and/or the applicable authority may adjust the amount of required financial
security by redetermining the estimated cost for completion of the uncompleted improvements as
of the expiration of the 90th day after either the date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled
date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may require the developer to
post additional security in order to insure that the financial security equals 110% of the estimated
cost of the Township and/or the applicable authority completing the improvements at a time 90
days following the date scheduled for completion or alternatively reduce the required security so

that it equals such amount. Any additional security shall be posted by the developer within 30 days
after being notified of the same. The amount of financial security required by the applicable
authority shall be computed in accordance with the applicable authority's rules and regulations.
As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial
security may request the Township to release or authorize the release from time to time, such
portions of the financial security necessary for the payment to the contractor or contractors
performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors,
and the Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from the receipt of such request to allow the
Township Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such portion of the work
has been completed in accordance with the approved plan. Upon such certification, the Board of
Supervisors shall authorize release from the required financial security of an amount as estimated
by the Township Engineer as representing the value of the work completed.
The value of the work completed shall be determined by subtracting 110% of the estimated cost of
the completion of the remaining uncompleted work from the total amount of security deposited.
At such time as 90% of the lots in the subdivision have been improved as set forth above, or if at
the expiration of three years from the date all of the improvements excepting the surface course
has been completed, less than 90% of the lots have been so improved, the Township may notify
the developer to complete the surface course within 60 days from the date of such notice. In
computing the sixty-day requirement, the period from November 1 to April 1 shall not be counted.
If, at the time the wearing course is completed, 90% of the lots are not improved as set forth
above, the developer must:
Post with the Township financial security in an amount equal to 15% of the reasonable cost of
the surface course as security to guarantee that damages to the road or street would not
occur during the completion of the improvements on the unimproved lots in such developer's
subdivision or land development. The Township shall hold such financial security and utilize it
to pay for the repair of any damage occurring to the road during the period between the
commencement of improvements on any particular unimproved lot and the completion of such
improvements irrespective of whether or not it can be established that the damage to the road
was caused by contractors or other persons working in and about the construction of such
improvements. The financial security shall be in a form acceptable to the Township.
Present to the Township agreements signed by the owners of all of such unimproved lots
pursuant to which they will agree to pay to the Township the cost of repairing any damage
occurring to roads in such subdivision during the period between the commencement of work
on the improvements to their lot and the completion of such improvements irrespective of
whether or not it can be established that such damage was caused by contractors or other
persons involved in the improvement of their respective lot.
§ 236-502. Release from financial security.
When the developer has completed all of the improvements as shown on the final plans, the
developer shall notify the Board of Supervisors, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements, enclosing therewith certification by the engineer
qualified to perform such duties and responsible for the design of the improvements that they have
been installed as designed, and shall send copies of the notice and certification to the Township
Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and
authorize the Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Township
Engineer shall thereupon file a report, in writing, with the Board of Supervisors and shall promptly
mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made
and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization
from the Board of Supervisors, said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection
of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements or any portion thereof

shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Township Engineer, said report shall contain a
statement of the reasons for such nonapproval or rejection. Improvements shall not be considered
completed unless the developer can demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this
chapter and all other applicable ordinances, statutes and regulations. Improvements shall also not
be considered complete until as-built plans of all stormwater management facilities, any
improvements to be dedicated to the Township and/or the applicable authority, and of all streets,
whether or not such streets shall be dedicated, have been submitted to the Township and/or the
applicable authority, as applicable.
The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer within 15 days of receipt of the Township
Engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered mail, of its action with relation thereto. If the
Board of Supervisors or Township Engineer fails to comply with the time limitation provisions
contained herein, or such time limitations as contained in the MPC, whichever requirements shall
contain a longer time period for action by the Township, all improvements will be deemed to have
been approved and the developer's posted financial security shall be released.
If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Board of
Supervisors, the developer shall proceed to complete the same, and upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the developer's right to contest or
question by legal proceedings or otherwise any determination of the Board of Supervisors or
Township Engineer.
§ 236-503. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
In the event that any improvements that may be required have not been installed as provided in this
chapter or in accordance with the approved final plan, the Board of Supervisors may enforce any letter
of credit or other financial security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If proceeds of such
financial security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Board of Supervisors may, at its option, install such
improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may institute appropriate legal
or equitable action to recover the monies necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements.
All the proceeds, after deducting the costs of collection, whether resulting from the financial security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer or both, shall be used solely for the
installation of the improvements covered by such security and not for any other Township purpose.
§ 236-504. Inspection during construction.
The Township and/or the applicable authority shall inspect the improvements during construction.
The developer shall pay the cost of any such inspection in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the MPC.[1] The developer shall provide at least 24 hours' notice prior to the start of
construction of any improvements that are subject to inspection. All inspections of completed
items shall be requested, in writing, at least 48 hours in advance of the inspection time and date.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10501 et seq.
General site construction. It is generally required that the following phases of site construction
have mandatory inspection. This general list of phases may be amended by mutual agreement of
the Township and developer when the site requires special construction procedures. The
inspection schedule must be recorded with the final plan or shown on the approved improvement
construction plan.
Upon completion of preliminary site preparation, including stripping of vegetation, stockpiling
of topsoil and construction of temporary erosion and sedimentation control devices.

release of the financial guarantee for completion of final grading, vegetative controls required
by the BMP standards, or other site restoration work.
Street construction.
Preparation of road subgrade. At the time of this observation, the subgrade should be proof
rolled, and the proposed crown and grade should be checked. It is recommended that a
developer's/contractor's representative accompanies the observer when the crown and grade
are checked. Proof rolling should be performed with a fully loaded, tandem-axle dump truck.
This observation must occur prior to any stone subbase being placed.
Placement and compaction of road subbase. At the time of this observation, the depth of
subbase should be checked after compaction, the subbase should be proof rolled in the same
manner as the subgrade and the crown and grade should be checked again. This observation
must occur prior to any binder or base course being placed.
Placement and compaction of the binder/base course. At the time of this observation, the
depth of the binder/base course should be checked, ambient temperature should be
monitored (this is important in early spring and late fall when the temperature can fall below
acceptable limits), the temperature of the bituminous material should be checked (if possible),
and it is recommended that copies of the weight slips for each truckload be obtained. The
crown and grade should also be checked again. This observation must occur prior to the
wearing course being placed.
Placement and compaction of the wearing course. At the time of this observation, the
guidelines for the placement and compaction of the binder/base course should be followed.
In addition to the above-outlined observations, additional observations will be made at the request
of the developer for reduction of financial securities. Random observations should be made at the
frequency desired by the Township. At the time of any of the above-listed observations, all ongoing
construction (i.e., storm drainage, sanitary sewer, water, erosion control, etc.) should also be
checked for compliance with the approved plans and the findings reported. Since the above
inspections are mandatory, it is recommended that requests for reduction of financial guarantee to
be submitted to coincide with the above inspections.
§ 236-505. Offers of dedication.
Any offer to dedicate any street or portion thereof shall be made on forms provided by the
Township, along with all required supporting documentation and required fees. Offers for
dedication may be submitted to the Township at any time during the calendar year; however, the
Township will not formally act upon any offer of dedication prior to April 15 nor later than
September 1 of any calendar year.
The offer to dedicate streets, parks or other areas or portions of them does not impose any duty
upon the Township and/or the applicable authority concerning maintenance or improvement until
the proper authorities of the Township and/or the applicable authority have made actual
acceptance of the dedication by ordinance or resolution or by entry or improvement.

completion, the Township may require the posting of financial security to secure the structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with
the design and specifications as depicted on the final plan for a term of 18 months from the date of
acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise required
in § 236-501 of this chapter with regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of
such financial security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of the installation of the said
improvements.
Where the applicable authority accepts dedication of some or all of the required improvements,
the applicable authority may require the posting of financial security in accordance with its rules
and regulations and applicable law.
§ 236-506. Maintenance of streets.
The developer shall maintain all streets in the subdivision or development in travelable condition,
including the prompt removal of snow therefrom, until such time as the streets are accepted by the
Township as part of the Township highway system or, if such streets are not to be dedicated, until a
homeowners' association or other entity responsible for the maintenance of the streets has been
formed.
§ 236-507. Effect of plan recording on dedication and
reservations.
Recording of the final plan after approval by the Board of Supervisors has the effect of an irrevocable
offer to:
Dedicate all streets and other public ways to public use, unless such streets are indicated on said
plan as private streets.
Dedicate all neighborhood parks and all areas shown on the plan as being local recreation sites to
public use.

Where a development abuts an existing or proposed arterial or collector street, the Board of
Supervisors may require access management techniques such as the use of marginal access
streets, reverse frontage lots, or other such treatment that will provide protection for abutting
properties, reduce the number of intersections with the arterial or collector street, and
separate the local and through traffic.
Streets shall be designed with consideration to both existing and planned streets. All streets
shall be arranged to conform as closely as possible to the original topography. New streets
shall be connected with streets of similar function, to form continuations thereof. Local streets
shall be laid out to discourage use by through traffic. Streets shall be laid out to provide
convenient and safe access to the property. The rigid rectangular street pattern need not be
adhered to; the use of curvilinear streets may be provided when their use will result in a more
desirable layout. Where a development abuts an existing or proposed major street, the Board
of Supervisors may require the use of marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots or such
other treatment that will provide protection for abutting properties, reduce the number of
intersections with the major street and separate the local and through traffic.
Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce reasonable grades,
satisfactory drainage and suitable building sites.
Where appropriate, areas shall be reserved for future street usage in conjunction with the
development of adjacent tracts. Areas to be reserved for future street usage shall be required
to be improved to the boundary of the tract being developed.
Wherever there exists a dedicated or platted area reserved for future street usage along the
boundary of a tract being developed, the street on the adjacent tract shall be extended into
the proposed project.
Plans with street locations along the perimeter of a property shall be required to show building
setback lines and clear sight triangles within the adjacent properties. Written permission from
the affected adjacent landowner shall be provided prior to preliminary plan approval.
When existing stub streets or temporary cul-de-sac streets adjoin the tract to be developed,
they shall be extended into the site and made part of the proposed street layout. Where a
temporary cul-de-sac is being extended, the bulb shall be reconstructed to Township street
specifications, any existing sidewalk extended through the area, and the remaining areas
shall be regraded and seeded.
Improvement of existing streets and intersections. Where a subdivision or land development
abuts an existing Township and/or state street or shall have a traffic impact on an existing
Township and/or state street as indicated by a traffic impact study required to be performed in
accordance with this chapter, the developer shall be required to make the following
improvements:
In cases where a subdivision or land development abuts an existing Township and/or
state street, the street shall be reconstructed to the widths specified in this chapter.
In cases where the development is situated only on one side of an existing street, the
Township may require that only that side of the street be reconstructed.
Where the developer of the subdivision or land development is required to provide a
traffic impact study and the traffic impact study indicates that improvements are required,
the developer shall install the improvements, including but not limited to traffic signals,
traffic control devices additional traffic lanes, traffic dividers and highway markings.
When the Township determines that the required improvements are not feasible at the
time of development of the use, the developer shall deposit funds with the Township in
the amount of 110% of the cost of the improvements computed in accordance with Article

current Township standards shall be provided with a transition area, the design of which is
subject to Township approval.
Street improvements. All construction shall be in conformance with the provisions and
specifications of the Township. (See Appendix No. 13.)[1]
Paving cross sections. All street paving shall conform to the following specifications:
Before paving the street surface, the applicant must install the required utilities and
provide, where necessary, adequate stormwater drainage for the street, acceptable
to the Board of Supervisors. The pavement base, wearing surface and shoulders
must be constructed according to the following specifications; excepting, however,
that for the construction of arterial streets or highways, the developer shall consult
with the Township Engineer and be governed by PennDOT for the method of
construction to be used, and the design shall conform to the most recent version of
PennDOT Publication 242, Pavement Policy Manual, as amended.
All new streets shall be designed to the following cross-sectional specifications (all
courses are compacted thicknesses).
The use of recycled materials is strongly encouraged.

The Board of Supervisors, after consulting with the Township Engineer, shall decide if a
collector or arterial street is required as a direct result of the construction of this
development in which case the applicant is responsible for paving the additional width
required and submitting pavement design calculations in accordance with the most
recent version of PennDOT Publication 242, Pavement Policy Manual, as amended.
Concrete curbing in accordance with Township specifications is required for all new
streets. Where a modification of this section is granted by the Board of Supervisors,
shoulders shall be provided in accordance with the following:
All shoulders shall be constructed in accordance with the most recent version of

Arterial streets shoulder type shall be determined by the Board of Supervisors after
consulting with the Township Engineer and PennDOT.
Editor's Note: Appendixes are included as attachments to this chapter.
Dedication of additional right-of-way. If a subdivision or land development abuts an existing
Township street and/or state street which has a right-of-way width of less than the widths as
set forth in this chapter, the developer shall dedicate to the Township or commonwealth, as
applicable, that amount of land necessary so that the distance from the center line of the
street to the edge of the right-of-way abutting the proposed development is 1/2 the ultimate
right-of-way width set forth in this chapter.
When the proposed development requires construction within an existing street right-of-way,
such as sewer, water or stormwater lines, the Township may require construction of a new
wearing course along the entire frontage and/or disturbed area.
If lots subdivided from the tract proposed for development are large enough to permit
resubdivision or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided or developed, adequate rights-of-way
for streets and other required improvements shall be provided as necessary to permit further
subdivision or development.
Future access strips are rights-of-way reserved for future street improvements. They shall be
designed in conformance with the design requirements of a street, and the contiguous parcels
must contain proper setbacks and sight distances.

As a minimum, all new streets shall be graded to the right-of-way line. All cut-and-fill banks
shall not exceed the steepness of a 3:1 slope.
Streets shall be designed to preclude or minimize the need for guide rail. The Township may,

Horizontal alignment.
Horizontal street alignments shall be measured along the center line.
Horizontal curves shall be used at all direction changes.
The center line of the street cartway shall correspond with the center line of the street right-ofway.
Plans with street locations along the perimeter of a property shall be required to show building
setback lines and clear sight triangles within the adjacent properties. Written permission from
the affected adjacent landowner shall be provided prior to preliminary plan approval.
There shall be a tangent section of at least 100 feet between reverse curves for all local and
collector streets.
Horizontal curve center-line radii shall be designed in coordination with vertical geometry,
subject to the approval of the Township. The minimum acceptable center-line radii shall be
300 feet for arterial and collector streets and 150 feet for local and special purpose residential
streets.
Vertical alignment.
Vertical curves shall be used in all changes of grade.
The minimum vertical grade for all streets shall be 1%; the maximum vertical grade shall be
10%.
At street intersections, the through street shall be approached by side streets in accordance
with the following standards: where the grade of the side street exceeds 4%, there shall be a
level area on the side street within which no grade shall exceed 4% for a minimum distance of
100 feet (measured from the intersection of the center lines of the streets).
No side street shall intersect a through street where the through street exceeds 7% in grade.
The length of vertical curve shall be based on the formula L = KA, where L is the minimum
length of curve in feet, K is the length of vertical curve per percent change in A, and A is the
algebraic difference in grade (in percent). Table 6-2 lists the minimum rate of vertical
curvature for K:

Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets.
A cul-de-sac will not be approved when a through street could be constructed or would be
more advantageous.
Except as otherwise provided within this section, all culs-de-sac shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the standards for local streets in this chapter.
The center-line length of permanent cul-de-sac streets shall be greater than 250 feet and
shall not exceed 600 feet. The length of the cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the
center-line intersection of the intersecting street to the center of the cul-de-sac turnaround.
Permanent cul-de-sac streets must be provided with a paved turnaround with a minimum
diameter in accordance with Table 6-3 of this chapter.
Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the turnaround right-of-way shall
be placed adjacent to the tract boundary with sufficient additional width provided along the
boundary line to permit extension of the street at full width.
Temporary cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 800 feet in length measured from the centerline
intersection of the intersecting street to the center of the cul-de-sac turnaround.
Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as cul-de-sac streets, except in the case of
streets which are planned for future extension into adjoining tracts and which will be no longer
than the depth of one lot and which will not be the primary means of access to any lot or
dwelling unit, the Township may waive the requirements of providing a turnaround.
Any street temporarily dead-ended in order to provide for future continuation of the street into
adjoining property or for authorized section/phase development shall be fully constructed and
all utilities installed. A barricade to prevent vehicular access to adjoining property shall be
constructed at the termination point of the street. The barricade shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with acceptable PennDOT specifications and approved by the
Township.
Where any adjacent stub street is not proposed for extension as a through street, a cul-desac
shall be constructed in compliance with Township standards.
Drainage of cul-de-sac streets shall preferably be toward the open end. If drainage is toward
the closed end, water shall be conveyed away in an underground storm sewer or by other
means approved by the Township. The minimum grade on culs-de-sac shall be designed to
ensure a minimum of 1%, maximum of 5% along the curbline to the designed low points.
Temporary culs-de-sac shall be constructed to the same cartway width as required for
permanent culs-de-sac. Temporary easements shall be provided for the affected adjoining
properties until such time that the street is extended. The use of a temporary cul-de-sac
turnaround shall be guaranteed to the public until such time as the street is extended.
Sidewalks along temporary culs-de-sac shall be continued at the same time that the street is
continued. Restoration to the temporary cul-de-sac paved areas and sidewalk system within
the right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the developer.
Street intersections.
Intersections involving the junction of more than two streets are prohibited.
The distance between the center line of streets opening onto the opposite sides of existing or

The cartway edge at street intersections shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a minimum
radius of 35 feet for local and special purpose streets or alleys and 50 feet for intersections
involving arterial and collector streets. The right-of-way radii at intersections shall be
substantially concentric with the edge of the cartway. The Township may require larger radii
based on the largest design vehicle using the intersection.
All streets intersecting a state street shall be subject to the approval of the PennDOT.
Clear sight triangle. When stop control devices are not provided on the lesser street
classification or access drive, there shall be provided and maintained at all intersections a
clear sight triangle in accordance with the most recent version of the Lancaster Township
Zoning Ordinance, as amended (Article XVI).[2] All clear sight triangles shall be indicated on
all plans.
All intersections shall be provided with appropriate stop control devices on the lesser
classification street or access drive.
Clear sight triangles shall include the area on each street corner that is bounded by the
line which connects the sight or "connecting" points located on each of the right-of-way
lines of the intersecting street. The planting of trees, other plantings, signs, and
structures exceeding 30 inches in height that would obstruct vision across the clear sight
triangle shall be prohibited.

Safe stopping sight distance (SSSD).
In addition to the other requirements of this article, there shall be unobstructed required
minimum SSSD at all intersections, as specified below:
Required SSSDs shall be at least as large as the minimum SSSDs.
SSSD = 1.47 Vt + V /30 (f+G)
Where:
SSSD = Minimum safe stopping sight distance (feet).
V = Speed of vehicle in miles per hour.
t = 2.5 seconds (perception/response time of driver).
f = 0.3 (wet pavement friction).
G = Roadway grade in percent divided by 100 (positive for
upgrade, negative for downgrade).
If the 85th percentile speed varies by more than 10 miles per hour from the posted
speed limit, the Township may require the 85th percentile speed to be used to
determine stopping distance.

Native and invasive planting.
Native plant materials shall be incorporated in all designs. Native plant materials shall be
incorporated in all designs. The use of native plant material can help improve water
quality, provide additional and improved wildlife habitat, and typically adapt to local
conditions which then require less maintenance. Native plants must be used near
greenways, suburban forested areas, wetlands, and riparian areas.
Except as noted above, non-native plants may be included in place of a native plant if it is
not considered invasive and the plant does not introduce pests or diseases. A non-native
plant may be incorporated into designs when they prove to be better suited for the urban
soil, environment, or spatial constraints, urban stress mitigation, and integration into the
surrounding ecosystem.
Any existing vegetation that is in appropriate locations, of an acceptable species and quality
may be used to fulfill landscaping or buffering requirements.
Street tree and landscaping maintenance requirements, as listed in Appendix 11, shall be
noted on the plan, unless an acceptable maintenance agreement is provided.[1]

The park, recreation and open space land shall be accessible to utilities such as sewer, water
and power that are provided with the subdivision, and if so requested by the Township that will
accept dedication of the land, the developer shall extend such utilities to the park, recreation
and open space land.
If the contiguous property has previously been developed and recreational land has been
provided at the boundary of that previously developed property, the Board of Supervisors
shall require that the recreational land required of the development shall be located adjoining
the previously provided recreational land.
A minimum of 0.02 acre of land shall be reserved as park or recreational land for each residential
lot created in a subdivision or each dwelling unit created in a land development. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in all cases the minimum area of land reserved as park and recreation land shall be
equal to the minimum lot size in the district in which the subdivision or land development is
located.
The developer may request that the Board of Supervisors permit the provision of park and
recreation land other than through public dedication of land as set forth above. The developer
shall set forth, in writing, the means by which he will fulfill this requirement which may include the
payment of a fee in lieu of dedication of all or a portion of the amount of land required to be
dedicated, construction of recreational facilities, the private reservation of land, or any combination
of dedication, fees, construction of recreational facilities, or private reservation.
If a fee in lieu of dedication is proposed by the developer, the amount of the fee shall be
substantially equal to the value of the land that would be set aside if the standards specified in
§ 236-609D of this chapter were to be applied. A flat per-dwelling-unit fee in lieu of dedication
is set by resolution of the Township, if the developer chooses not to provide evidence of the
value of the land.
The fee shall be paid to the Township prior to the approval of the plan application.
All fees shall be held and used by the Township in accordance with the requirements of Article
V of the MPC.
If the developer proposes to construct recreational facilities, the developer shall present a
sketch plan of such facilities and an estimate of the cost of construction.
If the developer proposes the private reservation of land, the developer shall provide for the
maintenance of such land through either the inclusion of such land as common elements of a
condominium or the creation of a homeowners' association which shall meet the requirements
for a unit owners' association contained in the Pennsylvania Uniform Condominium Act, 68
Pa.C.S.A. § 3101 et seq. Such documentation shall be recorded, shall provide that the land
cannot be further developed and shall give the Township the right, but not the obligation, to
maintain the land, at the owner's expense, as set forth in Article VII of the MPC dealing with
the maintenance of common open space in planned residential developments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the developer may request that the Board of Supervisors
approve transfer of the land to an organization dedicated to the conservation of natural
resources with deed restrictions preventing further development acceptable to the Township.
The developer shall enter into an agreement with the Township setting forth the fees to be
paid, the facilities to be constructed, or the land to be privately reserved and the method of its
maintenance. All such agreements shall be in a form satisfactory to the Township.
§ 236-610. Emergency access requirements.
All subdivisions or land developments containing 25 or more dwelling units or nonresidential
buildings or buildings containing 15,000 or greater square feet of gross floor area shall be

provided with at least two separate and distinct means of access to the subdivision or land
development.
Access may be provided through the location of two or more public or private streets, each of
which intersects with an existing public street. Such public or private streets shall meet all the
requirements of this chapter concerning design and construction.
Access for a land development may be provided through two or more access drives into the land
development. Such access drives shall be separated by a distance of at least 150 feet and shall
comply with all requirements of this chapter.
If the applicant is unable to provide access to the subdivision or land development through two or
more public or private streets, each of which intersect with an existing public street or two or more
access drives which intersect with one or more existing public streets, an emergency access shall
be provided.
The emergency access shall be improved so that emergency vehicles may safely transverse
it and shall be indicated on the plans.
The emergency access shall be acceptable to the providers of emergency services within the
Township and approved by the Township. Applicants proposing to provide emergency access
shall submit evidence of such approval.
The emergency access may be located so that access to the subdivision or land development
is gained from a public street at a location unsuitable for regular access with an existing public
street.
The emergency access may be located so that access is gained from an adjacent tract. For
example, a subdivision or land development adjoining a parking compound of another use
may provide emergency access through a point with a break chain. Applicants with plans
indicating emergency access through a contiguous private tract shall provide evidence that
the adjoining property owner has consented to such emergency access location.
§ 236-611. Refuse collection stations.
Outdoor refuse collection stations shall be provided for garbage and trash removal when individual
collection is not made and indoor storage is not provided.
Refuse collection stations shall be located outside of the front yard and separated adequately from
habitable buildings to avoid being offensive, but at the same time be convenient for both collectors
and residents, and shall be effectively screened so as not to be visible from off-site adjacent
parking areas, roadways, or adjacent residential properties. Such areas shall be screened with a
combination of architectural masonry (or fencing) and/or landscaping with a height of at least six
feet, in accordance with the landscaping and screening regulations of the most recent version of
the Lancaster Township Zoning Ordinance, as amended (Article XIV).[1]
Editor's Note: See Ch. 280, Zoning.
Refuse collection stations shall be so constructed as to prevent the escape of refuse by wind,
water or other natural elements and prevent animals, rodents, etc., from entering.

All requests for modifications shall be processed in accordance with § 236-308 of this chapter.
The provisions of these regulations are intended as a minimum standard for the protection of the
public health, safety, and welfare. If the literal compliance with any mandatory provision of these
regulations is shown by the applicant, to the satisfaction of the majority of the members of the
Board of Supervisors present at a scheduled meeting, to create an undue hardship or appears to
be unreasonable as it applies to a particular property or that an alternative proposal will allow for
equal or better results, the Board of Supervisors may grant a modification from such mandatory
provision, so that substantial justice deemed necessary and advisable may be done and the public
interest secured while permitting the reasonable utilization of the property. The granting of a
modification shall not have the effect of making null and void the intent and purpose of this
chapter.
In granting modifications, the Board of Supervisors may impose such conditions as will, in its
judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards and requirements of this chapter.
§ 236-804. Challenges and appeals.
Any person aggrieved by a finding, decision, or recommendation of the Board of Supervisors with
respect to the approval or disapproval of a plan or modification request may appeal in either of two
ways specified below:
The decision may be appealed, as provided for in the MPC.
The decision may be appealed to the Board of Supervisors, in writing, within 10 days after the
date of action of the Board of Supervisors. Upon receipt of such appeal and after proper
notification of any parties in interest, the Board of Supervisors may affirm, modify, or reverse the
previous action by a recorded vote. The findings and reasons for the disposition of the appeal
shall be stated on the records of the Township and a copy shall be given to the party who has
made the appeal. This decision may be further appealed as provided for in the MPC. The appeal
period shall start immediately after the final decision of the Board of Supervisors on the appeal.
§ 236-805. Violations and penalties.
Any person, partnership, or corporation, or the members of such partnership or the officers of such
corporation, who or which, being the owner or agent of the owner of any lot, tract or parcel of land,
shall lay out, construct, open, or dedicates any street, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main, or
other improvements for public use, travel or other purposes or for the common use of occupants of
buildings abutting thereon; or sells, transfers or agrees or enters into an agreement to sell any
land in a subdivision or land development whether by reference to or by other use of a plat of such
subdivision or land development or otherwise; or erects any building or buildings which constitute
a land development thereon; or commences site grading or construction of improvements prior to
recording of a final plan unless such grading or construction is for the sole purpose of installing
improvements as prescribed in Article III of this chapter herein unless and until a final plan has
been prepared in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and has been recorded as
provided herein; or fails to comply with any condition imposed upon approval of a preliminary plan
or a final plan or any condition imposed upon the granting of a modification; or fails to comply with
any agreement with the Township relating to development in accordance with a preliminary plan or
a final plan; or fails to comply with any note included on an approved preliminary plan or final plan
commits a violation of this chapter.
Penalties for violations.

liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a judgment

the Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by a District Justice/Magisterial
District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure. Each day that
a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation unless the District
Justice/Magisterial District Judge, determining that there has been a violation, further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation
violating this chapter to have believed that there was no such violation. If the District
Justice/Magisterial District Judge makes a determination of good faith, there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of determination of a
violation by the District Justice/Magisterial District Judge, and thereafter each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
The Township may institute and maintain actions at law or in equity to restrain, correct or
abate violations of this chapter, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and/or
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises.
The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further
improve or develop any real property which has been developed or which has resulted from a
subdivision or land development of real property in violation of this chapter. The authority to
deny such permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
The owner of record at the time of such violation.
The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such violation without regard
to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of the
violation without regard as to whether such current owner had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired the property
subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee
had actual constructive knowledge of the violation.
As an additional condition for the issuance of a permit or the granting of an approval to any
such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the development of any such real property,
the Township may require compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to
the property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real estate.
The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the
process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or
from the remedies herein provided.
No applicant shall proceed with any site grading or construction of improvements prior to
recordation of a final plan as specified in this chapter, unless such grading or construction is
undertaken in accordance with this chapter. No deeds shall be executed or recorded for lots, nor
shall the construction of any structure be initiated, before the Township has approved the final plan
and such plan is filed with the Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds.
§ 236-806. Records.
The Township shall keep an accurate, public record of its findings, decisions, and recommendations
relevant to all applications filed with it for review or approval.

§ 247-6. Imposition of tax.
A tax is hereby levied and imposed, for general township purposes, on every real estate transaction, at
the rate of 1% of the value of the real estate represented by the document involved in the real estate
transaction.
The tax shall be payable at the earlier of the time the document is presented for recording, within
30 days of acceptance of the document, or within 30 days of becoming an acquired company.
If the real estate is located partially within and partially outside the township, the tax shall be
calculated on the value of the portion within the township.
The tax imposed hereunder shall be due and payable to the collector, as a joint and several
liability, by every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for recording any
document, or in whose behalf any document is made, executed, delivered, accepted or presented
for recording. In the case of an acquired company, the company shall also have liability for
payment of the tax. All such persons shall also be liable for any penalties imposed under this
article.
It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed on a real estate transaction
by the township and other political subdivisions shall not exceed the limitations prescribed in
Section 8 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6908, so that if any other political subdivision
imposes a tax on real estate transactions taxed under this article, the provisions of said Section 8
shall apply.

The tax imposed by § 247-6 shall not be imposed upon:
A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities, agencies or political

spouse of a brother or sister and between a grandparent and grandchild or the spouse of such
grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the grantee within one year shall be subject to
tax as if the grantor were making such transfer.
A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property passing by testate or intestate
succession from a personal representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an ordinary trust where the transfer
of the same property would be exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of

trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all possible beneficiaries.

trust.

the benefit of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is the property of

In addition, in the case of failure of any acquired company to record a declaration of acquisition, as
required by this article, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the township that such failure is due
to reasonable cause, a penalty shall accrue at the rate of 5% per month or fractional part of a
month, on the amount of the unpaid tax, from the due date until the amount of the tax is paid in

No document upon which tax is imposed by this article shall at any time be made the basis of any
action or other legal proceeding, nor shall proof thereof be offered or received in evidence in any

this commonwealth, unless the tax imposed hereunder shall have been paid in full and evidence
of payment shall have been affixed thereto by the collector.
§ 247-16. Lien.
The tax imposed by this article shall be a lien against the real estate to which the document relates
and, in the case of an acquired company, the real estate owned by the acquired company. The lien
shall date from the time when the tax is due and payable and shall continue until discharged by
payment in full of the tax, together with all penalties. In order to enforce the lien, the township may
proceed under the Municipal Claims and Liens Act of 1923, 53 P.S. § 7101 et seq., or in any other
appropriate manner.
§ 247-17. Proceeds of judicial sale.
The tax imposed under this article shall be fully paid, and have priority out of the proceeds or any

In order to ascertain the amount of taxes due when the property is located in more than one
political subdivision, the Recorder shall not accept for recording any document unless it is
accompanied by a statement of value showing what taxes are due each political subdivision.
On or before the 10th of each month, the Recorder shall pay over to the township all local realty
transfer taxes collected, less 2% for use of the county, together with a report containing the
information as is required by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in reporting collections of the
Pennsylvania realty transfer tax. The 2% commission shall be paid to the county.
In accordance with Act 77-1986, any recorder of deeds who shall record any document upon
which tax is imposed under this article without payment of tax as required under this article as is
indicated in the document or accompanying statement of value shall, upon summary conviction,
be sentenced to pay a fine of $50 and costs of prosecution.

township shall deem necessary or appropriate, including a review or audit of any documents or
records of any party to a real estate transaction to determine the fair market value of the real
estate or any other relevant matter as determined by the township. Upon request of the township,

The Treasurer of this township is hereby charged with enforcement and collection of tax hereunder and
is empowered to promulgate and enforce reasonable regulations incident thereto.
§ 247-21. Interpretation and effect.
To the extent this article imposes a tax on a real estate transaction which is subject to the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania realty transfer tax imposed by Act 77-1986, and to the extent not
inconsistent herewith or with rules or regulations adopted by the township, this article shall be
interpreted in the same manner as Act 77-1986 and in accordance with regulations promulgated
thereunder.
The provisions of this article so far as they are the same as those of ordinances in force
immediately prior to the adoption of this article, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances,
and not as new enactments.
This article is intended to supplement the realty transfer tax in effect prior to adoption of this article
by imposing a tax on real estate transactions not covered by prior ordinances and now taxable
under Act 77-1986. This article shall impose a tax on all transactions which the township is
permitted to tax under Act 77-1986 to the fullest extent permissible.
In the event this article is declared invalid, the prior ordinance or ordinances of the township
levying a realty transfer tax shall remain in full force and effect, and shall not be affected in any

Further details concerning taxpayers' payment and making returns of tax levied by this article are
set forth in the regulations. If required in the regulations, taxpayers shall file a declaration of
estimated net profits and pay the tax due thereon and shall file quarterly returns of earned income
and pay the tax due thereon.
§ 247-32. Employers' collection at source.
As authorized in Section 10 of the Enabling Act,[1] Lancaster Township has entered into a joint
agreement with other political subdivisions for collection of the tax by the Bureau, and has
included in this article provision as deemed necessary for collection of the tax. Every employer
with a place of business within Lancaster Township, or within the jurisdiction of the Bureau as
defined in the regulations, is required to register, to deduct tax from earned income of employees
subject to the tax within the jurisdiction of the Bureau, to file quarterly reports and make
remittances, and to do other acts as fully set forth in Section 13(IV) of the Enabling Act.[2]
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 6910.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 6913.
Any employer who has no place of business in Lancaster Township, or within the jurisdiction of the
Bureau as defined in the regulations, but who desires, for the convenience of his employees
residing within Lancaster Township, to deduct tax hereunder from such employees' wages, shall
become subject to all obligations of timely filing of returns, reports and remittances, and of
maintaining and disclosing records, and to all interest and penalties with respect to such tax as he
may actually deduct, in all respects, and with the same incidents, as though he were a resident
employer.
Tax deducted from wages by an employer shall at all times be and remain the property of this
Lancaster Township, and shall constitute a trust fund in the employer's hands until remitted to the
Income Tax Officer; and deduction of tax from wages shall, as between the employee and
Lancaster Township, constitute payment of the tax by the employee, regardless of any insolvency
or failure to remit on the employer's part.
If and to the extent provided in the regulations, every employer who shall deduct tax from wages,
and remit it, may deduct from each such remittance a commission, not to exceed 2%, or any
lesser amount provided in the regulations, of the tax withheld. Lancaster Township expressly
authorizes the Bureau to amend the regulations to decrease or eliminate such commission.
§ 247-33. Income Tax Officer designated.
Lancaster Township hereby designates the Bureau (an unincorporated agency organized and operated
jointly by the school districts of Lancaster County) as its Income Tax Officer to perform all the duties,
be subject to all the requirements, and have all the powers prescribed by Section 13(V) of the Enabling
Act.[1] Said Bureau shall receive such compensation for its services as it and Lancaster Township may
agree from time to time. Lancaster Township expressly authorizes the Bureau to promulgate and
amend the regulations.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 6913.
§ 247-34. Suit for collection of tax; interest and penalties;
incorporation of provisions.

provided in Section 13(VII) and (VIII) of the Enabling Act.

Notwithstanding prior mention in this article, for convenience, of reference only, of specific
subsections of Section 13 of the Enabling Act, all provisions of the entire Section 13 of the
Enabling Act are hereby incorporated into this article by this reference, as required by the
Enabling Act. Any provisions which any future supplements to or amendments of the Enabling Act
may require to be included in or construed to be a part of any tax on earned income or net profits,
or of the ordinance levying the same, shall automatically become a part of this article upon the
effective date of such supplement or amendment, without the need for formal amendment of this
article by the Board of Supervisors of Lancaster Township to the maximum extent authorized by 1
Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.
§ 247-35. Deductions; losses; exemption for persons under age
16.
Employee's unreimbursed business expenses. Business expenses are as set forth in the
regulations.
Losses. Losses are as set forth in the regulations.
Persons under 16 years of age. This Board of Supervisors finds that minors of various age groups
have traditionally, and with judicial sanction, been considered as comprising separate classes for
many legislative purposes; and that minors under the age of 16 years are for the most part
unemancipated and subject to compulsory school attendance and child labor laws, and therefore
for the most part so lacking in power to earn and to have legal control of money or property that
enforcement of reporting and collection of tax hereunder against them would yield inconsequential
amounts and would be unduly difficult, expensive, and not in the public interest; and therefore
persons under the age of 16 years are hereby exempted from all liability for tax under this article.
§ 247-36. Continuity and scope.
The tax levied by this article imposes the same tax without substantial change as imposed in
previous years, and shall be so interpreted.
This article shall not apply to any person or property as to whom or which it is beyond the legal
power of Lancaster Township to impose any tax or duty herein provided for.
§ 247-37. Effect on prior provisions.
The provisions of this article, so far as they are the same as ordinances in force immediately prior to
the enactment of this article, including but not limited to a resolution passed by the Board of
Supervisors on May 11, 1970, are intended as a continuation of such resolution and not as a new
enactment. In the event that this article is declared invalid, the resolution passed May 11, 1970, and
any other ordinances or resolutions of Lancaster Township levying an earned income tax shall remain
in full force and effect and shall not be affected in any manner by enactment of this article. The
provisions of this article shall not affect any act done or liability incurred, nor shall they affect any suit
or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any right or penalty or to punish any offense under
the authority of any ordinance in effect prior to the enactment of this article. Subject to the foregoing
provisions of this section, this article shall supersede, replace and repeal ordinances or resolutions
levying an earned income tax, including but not limited to the resolution passed May 11, 1970, in force
immediately prior to the effective date of this article.
§ 247-38. Effective date.

collection, or any other matter relating to the earned income tax as reenacted by this article, such
revised provisions shall become effective January 1, 2000.

A building may be permitted closer to the street than required above when there is an
adjacent existing principal building on the same side of the street which is closer to the street
than the minimum front yard requirement and is within 100 feet of the building to be erected. If
the building to be erected is within 100 feet of only one such existing adjacent principal
building, the minimum front yard shall not be less than the average of the setback of the
existing principal building and the minimum front yard requirement; provided, however, that
this formula shall not require the placing of a building more than 10 feet back from the front
building line of the existing adjacent principal buildings. If the building to be erected is

feet at one end if increased by a similar or greater distance at the other end.
A yard space of 25 feet is required between end walls of buildings for each two-story building,
plus five feet for each additional story. If the buildings are at right angles to each other, the
distance between the corners of end walls of the buildings may be reduced to a minimum of
15 feet.
A yard space of 30 feet is required between end walls and front or rear faces of buildings for
each two-story building, plus five feet for each additional story.
When two adjacent buildings differ in the number of stories, the spacing shall not be less than

sized to permit a grouping of several businesses; lot areas may vary depending upon the use of public
utilities. This zoning district has been located amid the various residential concentrations to facilitate
convenient access to these services without creating additional congestion to and from larger
commercial centers. Strict design standards have been imposed to keep uses in this zoning district
compatible with nearby homes and neighborhoods.

§ 280-1203. Sign area and sign height.
The following regulations shall apply when interpreting sign area and sign height regulations in this
Article XII:
Sign area. The area of a sign shall be the area of the smallest rectangle, triangle, or circle that will
encompass all elements of the sign, such as letters, figures, symbols, designs, or other display.
When the sign is a separate unit, the area shall include any borders, framing, trim, decorative
attachments, background, and space between elements; it shall not include any supporting
structure unless that structure is illuminated, is in the form of a symbol, or contains advertising
elements.
When the sign is applied to a wall or otherwise has no definable edges, the area shall include
all color, artwork, or other means used to differentiate the sign from the surface upon which it
is placed.
When a single sign structure has more than one face with the same message, and no two
sign faces are more than three feet apart at any point, the area shall be computed by
determining the greatest total area of all sign faces visible from any single location.
Sign height. The height of a sign shall be measured from the average ground level beneath the
sign to the highest point of the sign. The ground level shall be the lower of the ground level
existing at the time of construction or the ground level existing prior to construction and prior to
any earth disturbance at the site. This prior ground level may be established by any reliable
source, including, without limitation, existing topographic maps, aerial photographs, photographs
of the site, or affidavits of people who are personally familiar with the site. No person(s) shall
artificially increase the maximum height of a sign by altering the grade at the base of the sign by
any means.
No sign shall be higher than the height limitation of the zoning district in which it is located.
The height of freestanding signs shall be controlled by the standards in Tables 12-1 and 12-2.

§ 280-1205. Specific regulations.
Tables 12-1 and Tables 12-2 provide regulations for specific types of signs in each zoning district. Note
that there are also supplemental regulations in § 280-1206 of this chapter which also regulate most
types of signs; these are referenced in the second column of Tables 12-1, the note at the top of Table
12-2-A, and the second column of Table 12-2-B.[1]
Permitted signs and sign permit requirements. Tables 12-1 indicate, for each zoning district, which
types of signs are permitted and not permitted and which types of signs require permits. Table 12-
1-A applies to signs on residential properties; Table 12-1-B applies to signs on nonresidential
properties. In those parts, an "N" indicates that the sign is not permitted; a "P-Y" indicates that the
sign is permitted and a permit is required; a "P-N" indicates that the sign is permitted and a permit
is not required. Table 12-1-C applies to signs in rights-of-way; these are approved through special
processes rather than through the regular permit procedure.
Permitted number, area, height, and setback for signs. Tables 12-2 indicate, for each zoning
district, information about the permitted number, maximum area, maximum height, and minimum
setback for each type of sign. Table 12-2-A has standards for the following types of signs:
business signs (except center signs), home occupation signs, and identification signs (except
development signs and public use signs). Table 12-2-B has standards for other types of signs.
Editor's Note: Tables 12-1 and 12-2 are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 280-1206. Supplemental regulations.
In addition to the regulations contained elsewhere in this Article XII, the following shall apply to specific
types of signs. The regulations in Tables 12-1 and Tables 12-2 apply in addition to the following
supplemental regulations.[1] Where the provisions in the supplemental regulations and Tables 12-1 and
Tables 12-2 are contradictory, the provisions contained in the supplemental regulations shall control.
Billboards.
There may be no more than one billboard structure at any point; it may have two surfaces
with a total of two messages, as long as the surfaces are back-to-back or at an angle of 45°
or less. Each surface may have an area of 300 square feet, whether or not the messages are
the same. The minimum yard for each billboard structure shall be in accordance with the
following:
Minimum front yard: 30 feet;
Minimum side yard: 15 feet;

Each billboard structure must be at least 1,200 feet from any other billboard structure and at
least 300 feet from any residential, rural, agricultural, or open space zoning district.
Business signs. Business signs are generally regulated in accordance with Table 12-1-B and Table
12-2-A. Business signs for individual businesses which are permitted by Table 12-2-A must be
located so that they are identified with the individual business, i.e., rather than being at the lot
(street) frontage of a large center, away from the business they are advertising. One specific type
of business sign is regulated in accordance with Tables 12-1-B and 12-2-B.[2]
Editor's Note: Tables 12-1-B, 12-2-A and 12-2-B are included at the end of this chapter.
Center signs. Center signs are allowed for centers such as shopping centers, office complexes,
and industrial parks which meet at least two of the following three minimums:
Five units;
Twenty thousand square feet of building area; and
Five acres of land.
Contractor signs.
Each contractor sign must be set back at least 10 feet from the cartway or at the building line,
whichever is less, may not be in the required minimum side yard, and may not be illuminated.
Contractor signs must be removed promptly upon completion of the project; signs that are not
removed promptly may be removed and impounded by the municipality, and the municipality
may recover a fee equal to the cost of removal and storage. No off-premises contractor signs
are permitted.
If there are four or more contractor signs on a single lot, they must be combined in a single
display by attaching them to a single background panel or frame as large as necessary to
accommodate one sign per contractor. The background is not included in calculating the sign
area, the height of the display may not exceed 10 feet, and the display may project a
maximum of 12 inches from the wall if attached parallel to the building.
Garage/yard sale signs. Garage/yard sale signs may be placed no more than 48 hours before the
sale and must be removed before the end of the day of the sale. Signs that are not removed within
the time limit may be removed and impounded by the Township, and the municipality may recover
a fee equal to the cost of removal and storage. No off-premises garage/yard sale signs are
permitted.
Home occupation signs. A home occupation sign may include a name, an address, an occupation
or activity, and a logo or trademark. There may be no illumination, except that a sign for a medical
office or emergency service may be illuminated when the business is open.
Identification signs. Identification signs are generally regulated in accordance with Tables 12-1 and
Table 12-2-A. However, two specific types of identification sign are regulated in accordance with
Table 12-2-B: development signs and public use signs.[3]
Editor's Note: Tables 12-1, 12-2-A and 12-2-B are included at the end of this chapter.
Development signs. Development signs are allowed for residential developments. They may
include only the name of the development and may not include any commercial advertising.
Incidental signs. Incidental signs must have a setback of 10 feet from the right-of-way, unless they
are 30 inches or less in height, in which case no setback is required.

plan.
Access to the communications tower shall be by a sixteen-foot-wide, mud-free, and permanently
passable lane, within a twenty-foot-wide right-of-way.
§ 280-1605. Conversion of existing building to multifamily
dwellings.
In any residential zoning district, the conversion of a building which existed prior to July 17, 1972, into
a multifamily dwelling is permitted, subject to the following conditions and approval by the Zoning
Hearing Board:
There shall be no extension of the building other than as may be required for access or for safety.
The lot area required for each existing and proposed dwelling unit shall be as follows:
In the Residential District R-1, 8,000 square feet per dwelling unit shall be provided.
In the Residential District R-2, 4,000 square feet per dwelling unit shall be provided.
In the Residential District R-3, 3,000 square feet per dwelling unit shall be provided.
§ 280-1606. Driveway and access drive regulations.
Definition. For the purpose of this section, the word "driveway" shall mean any entrance or exit
used by vehicular traffic to or from properties containing a single-family dwelling abutting a public
street.
Number of driveways per lot. Single-family dwellings shall not have more than one driveway
entering or exiting on the same street. However, if, in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors, lot
area and configuration would permit, loop driveways having two access points to a public street
may be permitted.
Location.
On corner lots, no driveway access may be located within 50 feet of the point of tangency of
the existing or proposed curb radius of the site. However, if this provision is shown by the
applicant to be a hardship, the Township may allow a reduction of this requirement. Access
shall be to the street of lesser classification when two street classifications are involved.
Driveways serving residential lots shall be located at least five feet from a side lot line. Where
a proposed driveway is to serve two or more adjacent lots, the Township may permit a
driveway to be located on or within five feet of the side lot line between the lots, measured
from the outside edge of the driveway.
When two or more driveways are located on a site, a separation of 50 feet, measured along
the public street right-of-way from driveway center line to driveway center line, is required.
Design.
In general, driveways used for two-way operation shall intersect public streets at 90° as site
conditions permit; however, in no case shall driveways intersect public streets at less than
70°. Driveways used for one-way operation, right turn only, shall not intersect public streets at
any angle less than 45°. Said angle shall be measured from the center line of the street to the
center line of the driveway.

Driveway dimensions and construction shall be designed to adequately accommodate the
type and volume of vehicles expected to use the site on a daily basis.
Vertical alignment of driveways serving residential lots shall not exceed a maximum of 8% for
the first 10 feet, measured from the right-of-way line.
Residential driveways on the turnaround of a cul-de-sac street may be exempted from the
above requirements at the discretion of the Zoning Officer.
Access and traffic control. Access to and from the site shall be designed in a manner conducive to
safe ingress and egress. The developer shall be responsible for the construction of any necessary
traffic control devices or additional lanes required by PennDOT or the Township. All entrances and
exits shall conform to the applicable driveway regulations of this chapter.
Permit required. Notwithstanding any other provisions set forth in § 280-1606 of this chapter, no
person, individual, firm or corporation shall construct, reconstruct, alter or enlarge an existing or
proposed driveway onto any public street without first having obtained a zoning permit as required
by Article XVIII of this chapter relating to administration and enforcement. Nothing in this section
shall prohibit a person, firm or corporation, however, from combining his or its application for a
driveway zoning permit with an application for a building permit, provided that all of the information
required by this section is contained on the application.
Plan submittal and permit application.
For all proposed driveways, the developer shall submit to the Zoning Office a permit
application, which is obtainable at the Township office. The Zoning Officer may also require
that a plan of the proposed driveway be submitted.
When a plan is required, the Zoning Officer shall review the plan for conformance with the
requirements of this chapter and shall:
Approve the application and plan as submitted; or
Return the application and plan for additional information and clarification; or
Disapprove the application, indicating in writing the reason for disapproval.
Fees. Permit application fees shall be as adopted by resolution of the Board of Supervisors from
time to time.
§ 280-1607. Fences.
Fences along side or rear lot lines are not subject to yard or setback requirements. All fences shall
be located completely within lot boundaries, and no fence may coincide with any lot line. However
a small setback is recommended to provide an area within which future maintenance may be
performed. Otherwise, fences along street right-of-way lines shall be set back two feet from the
street right-of-way lines.
No fence shall be erected in a street right-of-way or other rights-of-way or easements, including
public or private drainage, utility or access easements, unless otherwise required by this chapter,
or the most-recent version of the Lancaster Township Subdivision, Land Development and
Stormwater Management Ordinance, as amended, or any other Township ordinance.

most parallel to the street right-of-way providing vehicular access to the site. Additionally,
all areas of the "pole" shall be considered to be within the front yard.
Rear yard: the area between the principal structure and that lot line of the "flag" that is
directly opposite the front yard, as described in § 280-1608B(2)(a) above.
Side yards: the area between the principal structure and that one outermost lot line which
forms the "flag" and "pole," plus the area on the opposite side of the principal structure.

§ 280-1608F below. No more than two adjoining "poles" shall be permitted.
No more than one "tier" of flag lot shall be permitted. A "tier" shall be defined as a single row of
lots behind "conventional" lots that have the required frontage at the street right-of-way and lot
width at the minimum front building setback line.
Joint-use or shared driveways.
When one or more flag lots are proposed, such lots may rely upon a joint-use or shared
driveway for vehicular access in accordance with § 280-1606 of this chapter.
A joint-use or shared driveway must serve at least one flag lot but may also serve
conventional lots, up to a maximum of four total dwelling units.

The following requirements for the preservation of greenways apply to all areas of the Township where
the conditions are applicable and to all zoning districts:
Purpose. The preservation of greenways in Lancaster Township is essential to link the urban,
suburban, and rural areas of the Greater Lancaster Area and to preserve the Township's most
valuable natural, scenic, and recreational resources. The preservation of such resources is a
municipal zoning power authorized by Section 604 of the MPC.[1] The purpose of this section is to

network of intermunicipal trails and preservation areas.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10604.
Designated greenways. The most-recent version of the LIMC Comprehensive Plan identified
greenway corridors in Lancaster Township. To implement the recommendations of the plan, the
Township hereby designates greenways along the following bodies of water:
Little Conestoga Creek;
Conestoga River;
Unnamed tributary to the Conestoga River southwest of Millersville Road and adjacent to
Millersville Borough; and

Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, no provision of this chapter shall be
construed to enable or permit the expansion of a building, structure, sign or use of land, which
existed as a nonconforming building, structure, sign or use of land pursuant to the provisions of
any prior zoning regulation or ordinance, in excess of the limits of expansion for a nonconforming
building, structure, sign or use of land authorized by said prior zoning regulation or ordinance.
It is the express intent and purpose of this chapter that if a building, structure, sign or use of land
was expanded to the limits of expansion for a nonconforming building, structure, sign or use of
land as authorized by a prior zoning regulation or ordinance, no further expansion of said building,
structure, sign or land shall be authorized; and in the event a nonconforming building, structure,
sign or use of land was expanded to a portion of the limits of expansion authorized by a prior
zoning regulation or ordinance, additional expansion, if permitted by this chapter, shall only be
authorized to the amount of expansion not previously utilized pursuant to said prior zoning
regulation or ordinance.
§ 280-1702. Continuance of nonconforming uses and structures.
From and after the effective date of this chapter, any use and structure lawfully existing at the time of
the enactment of this chapter (February 8, 1999) but not in conformity with the use provisions for the
zoning district in which it is located may be continued, subject to the following limitations:
Expansion of nonconforming uses. No expansion of a nonconforming structure or use shall
hereafter be made unless an application has been filed with the Zoning Hearing Board and such
expansion has been approved by such Board as a special exception; provided, however, that the
expansion of the nonconforming use shall be limited to a distance of 250 feet in any direction from
the existing nonconforming structure or use or to an area equal to 25% of the existing total usable
area of the use or building; and provided, further, that any expansion of a nonconforming building
or use shall be limited to the lot limits which existed at the property in question at the time of
adoption of this chapter (February 8, 1999). The applicant shall provide evidence to the Zoning
Hearing Board as to the prior extent of any nonconforming use at the property. No new
nonconformities shall be created by any proposed expansion unless a variance is sought and
obtained from the Zoning Hearing Board.
Continuity of nonconforming use. Except as otherwise provided in § 280-1702E of this chapter, no
nonconforming use may be reestablished after it has been discontinued for 12 consecutive
months. Vacating of premises or buildings or nonoperative status of such premises or building
shall be presumptive evidence of discontinued use, refutable upon presentation of additional
competent evidence.
Substitution of nonconforming use. No nonconforming use may be changed to any other
nonconforming use unless the Zoning Hearing Board shall, in granting a special exception, find
that the proposed nonconforming use is not more detrimental to the zoning district than the
existing nonconforming use of the property. The Zoning Hearing Board may specify such
appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be required in connection with such change and
the granting of such special exception.
Damage to nonconforming buildings. Except as otherwise specifically provided, a nonconforming
building, structure or use which is partially damaged by fire, storm, accident or other unintended
casualty may be rebuilt and occupied for the same use as before the damage, provided that the
reconstructed building, structure or use shall not be larger than the damaged one and that the
reconstruction shall start within one year from the time of such damage. However, a
nonconforming building which has been damaged or destroyed to an extent of 60% or more of its
replacement cost shall not be continued, repaired or reconstructed.
Discontinued nonconforming use of open land. All nonconforming signs, billboards, junk areas,
storage areas, and other nonconforming uses of open land, when discontinued for a period of 90

days or damaged or deteriorated to an extent of 60% or more of replacement costs, shall not be
continued, repaired or reconstructed.
Substitution of a nonconforming use with a conforming use. If a nonconforming use is proposed to
be eliminated and a conforming use substituted but certain dimensional land regulations cannot be
met (such as area, yard, etc.), the Zoning Hearing Board, with such appropriate conditions and
safeguards as the Board may see fit, may grant a special exception to permit such conforming
use.
Status of a conforming use which was previously nonconforming. If a nonconforming use becomes
a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter revert back to a nonconforming use.
Side and rear yard regulations for accessory buildings on lots containing a nonconforming use.
The side and rear yard regulations are as required in those zoning districts where the use is a
permitted use or the use is allowed by a special exception.
§ 280-1703. Nonconforming lots.
Lots which are nonconforming because of lot area, lot width, or lot depth may be used for any use
permitted in the pertinent zoning district. Such uses shall comply with all other requirements of the
zoning district, with the following exceptions:
Lot area exceptions. Lots that are nonconforming because of lot area may be used for any use
permitted in the pertinent zoning district, provided that such uses shall comply with all other
requirements of the zoning district.
Side yard exceptions. Lots that are nonconforming because of lot width shall be exempt from the

applicable laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Zoning Officer shall not issue a permit or
certificate of use and occupancy in connection with any contemplated erection, construction, alteration,
extension, replacement, demolition, relocation, conversion or use of any building, structure, sign or
land unless it first conforms with the requirements of this chapter, all other ordinances of the Township
of Lancaster, and with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Application and permits. The Zoning Officer shall receive applications and issue zoning permits
and/or certificates of use and occupancy for the erection, construction, alteration, extension,

Inspections. Before the issuance of any permit by the Zoning Officer, all buildings, structures,
signs or land and portions thereof for which an application has been filed for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, replacement, demolition, relocation, conversion and/or use may
be examined or caused to be examined. Thereafter, such inspections as are required by the
Township during the construction of the work for which a permit has been issued may be made by
the Township or its agent. Upon completion of such work and before issuing a certificate of use
and occupancy, a final inspection shall be made; and all violations of approved plans or the zoning
permit shall be noted; and the holder of the permit shall be notified of the discrepancies, which
violations or discrepancies shall be rectified before a certificate of use and occupancy shall be
issued.
Complaints regarding violations. The Zoning Officer shall investigate alleged violations of this
chapter when in receipt of a signed written complaint stating fully the cause and basis thereof. If a
signed written complaint is received, said investigation shall be completed within 30 days of said
complaint. A written report of all investigations of this chapter shall be prepared and filed by the
Zoning Officer and a copy sent to the Board of Supervisors.

building or sign, until the Zoning Officer has issued a zoning permit for such work; provided,
however, that no zoning permit shall be required for any such construction or alteration, the

§ 280-1804. Conditions of permit.
Payment of fees. No zoning permit shall be issued until the fees prescribed by the Board of

section shall not relieve the applicant or holder of said zoning permit from payment of other fees
that may be required by this chapter or by any other ordinances or law.

and plans for which the zoning permit has been issued as well as the approved plot plan.

thereof until a certificate of use and occupancy has been issued by the Zoning Officer. Such
certificate shall be required whenever a zoning permit is required, as well as when there is a
change in the use of any existing land, structure, or building.
A certificate of use and occupancy shall also be obtained before using or occupying any land,
structure, or building or a portion thereof, after approval by the Zoning Hearing Board, for a
special exception or a variance, or the grant of a conditional use.

completion of the work without endangering life or public welfare. The Zoning Officer may also
issue a temporary certificate of use and occupancy for such temporary uses as tents, trailers and
buildings on construction sites, use of land for religious or other public or semipublic purposes and
similar temporary use or occupancy. Such temporary certificates shall be for a period of time to be
determined by the Zoning Officer; however, in no case for a period exceeding six months. The
Zoning Officer may renew such temporary certificates for additional periods of time, which shall

§ 280-1806. Enforcement, penalty and remedy.
It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to enforce this chapter.
Violation. The erection, construction, alteration, repair, demolition, extension, replacement,
relocation, conversion, and/or use and/or occupancy of any building, structure, sign, fence, wall,
parking compound, driveway, access drive, or land, or the change of use, area of use, percentage
of use or displacement of the use of any building, structure, sign, fence, wall, parking compound,
driveway, access drive, or land without first obtaining a zoning permit, when such permit is
required by this chapter, or the use of any building, structure, sign, fence, wall, parking compound,
driveway, access drive, or land without receipt of a certificate of use and occupancy, or the failure
to comply with any other provisions of this chapter or any terms and conditions of any decisions by
the Zoning Hearing Board, are hereby declared to be violations of this chapter of the Township.
Enforcement notice.
If it appears to the Township that a violation of this chapter has occurred or is occurring, the
Township shall initiate enforcement proceedings by sending an enforcement notice as
provided in this section.
The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the parcel on which the
violation has occurred, to any person who has filed a written request to receive enforcement
notices regarding that parcel, to any other person requested in writing by the owner of record,
and to any other person against whom the Township intends to take action. The enforcement
notice shall be sent by first-class mail and certified mail/return receipt requested. Return of
the signed return receipt card, or an unclaimed certified mailing combined with nonreturn of
the enforcement sent by first-class mail, shall constitute a conclusive presumption that the
enforcement notice recipient has been lawfully served.
An enforcement notice shall state at least the following:
The name of the owner of record and any other person against whom the Township
intends to take action.
The location of the property in violation.
The specific violation, with a description of the requirements which have not been met,
citing in each instance the applicable provisions of the ordinance.
The date before which the steps for compliance must be commenced and the date before
which the steps must be completed.
That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board within
30 days of the date of the notice in accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter.
That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified, unless extended by
appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions
clearly described.

Causes of action. In case any building, structure, sign, fence, wall, parking compound, driveway,
access drive, landscaping or land is, or is proposed to be, erected, constructed, altered,
converted, maintained or used in violation of this chapter, the Township or, with the approval of the
Township, an officer of the Township, or any aggrieved owner or tenant of real property who shows
that his property or person will be substantially affected by the alleged violation, in addition to
other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or
abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent, in or about such premises, any
act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation. Any such notice of that action shall be
served upon the Township at least 30 days prior to the time the action is begun by serving a copy
of the complaint on the Township. No such action may be maintained until such notice has been
given.
Enforcement remedies.
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated, is violating, or has
permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor
in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of not more
than $500, plus all court costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the Township
as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the
date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice. If the defendant neither pays
nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the
applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the District Justice determining that there has been a violation
further determines that there was a good-faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation
violating the ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there
shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the District Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid over to the Township.
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to grant to any person or
entity other than the Township the right to commence any action for enforcement pursuant to
this section.
Abatement of violation. The imposition of the penalties herein prescribed shall not preclude the
Township from instituting appropriate action to prevent unlawful erection or construction or to
restrain, correct or abate a violation or to prevent illegal use or occupancy of any structure,
building, sign, fence, parking compound, driveway, access drive, land or premises or to stop an
illegal act, conduct business, use or occupancy of a structure, building, sign or land in and about
any premises.

Membership of the Zoning Hearing Board shall consist of residents of the Township. Their terms of
office shall be three years and shall be so fixed that the term of office of no more than one
member shall expire each year. The Zoning Hearing Board shall promptly notify the Board of
Supervisors of any vacancies that occur. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be only for the
unexpired portion of the term. Members of the Zoning Hearing Board shall hold no other office in
the Township. Any member of the Zoning Hearing Board may be removed for malfeasance,
misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office or for other just cause by a majority vote of the Board of
Supervisors taken after the member has received a fifteen-day advance notice of the intent to take
such a vote. A hearing shall be held in connection with the vote if the member shall request it in
writing.
The Board of Supervisors may appoint by resolution at least one but no more than three residents
of the Township to serve as alternate members of the Board. The term of office of an alternate
member shall be three years. When seated pursuant to the provisions of § 280-1902 of this
chapter, an alternate shall be entitled to participate in all proceedings and discussions of the Board
to the same and full extent as provided by law for Board members, including specifically the right
to cast a vote as a voting member during the proceedings, and shall have all the powers and
duties set forth in this chapter and as otherwise provided by law. Alternates shall hold no other
office in the Township, including membership on the Planning Commission and Zoning Officer.
Any alternate may participate in any proceeding or discussion of the Board but shall not be entitled
to vote as a member of the Board nor be compensated pursuant to § 280-1903 of this chapter
unless designated as a voting alternate member pursuant to § 280-1902 of this chapter.
§ 280-1902. Organization.
The Board shall elect from its own membership its officers, who shall serve annual terms as such and
may succeed themselves. For the conduct of any hearing and the taking of any action, a quorum shall
be not less than a majority of all members of the Board, but the Board may appoint a hearing officer
from its own membership to conduct any hearing on its behalf, and the parties may waive further action
by the Board as provided in § 280-1904 of this chapter. If, by reason of absence or disqualification of a
member, a quorum is not reached, the Chairman of the Board shall designate as many alternate
members of the Board to sit on the Board in all proceedings involving the matter or case for which the
alternate was initially appointed until the Board has made a final determination of the matter or case.
Designation of an alternate pursuant to this section shall be made on a case-by-case basis in rotation
according to declining seniority among all alternates. The Board may make, alter, and rescind rules
and forms for its procedure, consistent with ordinances of the Township and laws of the
commonwealth. The Board shall keep full public records of its business, which records shall be the
property of the Township, and shall submit a report of its activities to the Board of Supervisors upon
request.
§ 280-1903. Expenditures for services.
The Board of Supervisors may prescribe reasonable fees with respect to hearings before the
Zoning Hearing Board. Fees for said hearings may include compensation for the Secretary and
members of the Zoning Hearing Board, notice and advertising costs and necessary administrative
overhead connected with the hearing. The costs, however, shall not include legal expenses of the
Zoning Hearing Board, expenses for engineering, architectural or other technical consultants or
expert witness costs.
Within the limits of funds appropriated by the Board of Supervisors, the Zoning Hearing Board may
employ or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other technical and
clerical services. Members of the Board may receive compensation for the performance of their
duties, as may be fixed by the Board of Supervisors. Alternate members of the Board may receive
compensation, as may be fixed by the Board of Supervisors, for the performance of their duties
when designated as alternate members pursuant to § 280-1902 of this chapter. In no case shall

appropriate fee is submitted to and received by the Zoning Officer.
All requests for a continuance of a scheduled hearing shall be submitted in writing with the
reasons therefor and shall contain a statement that the applicant agrees to an extension of time
period, within which the Zoning Hearing Board is required to hold a hearing or to render a written

continuance pays the fee prescribed by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to resolution.
The Zoning Hearing Board or the hearing officer shall keep a stenographic record of the
proceedings. The appearance fee for a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and
the Board. The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by the Board if the transcript is ordered
by the Board or hearing officer, or shall be paid by the person appealing from the decision of the
Zoning Hearing Board if such appeal is made; and in either event the cost of additional copies
shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases, the party requesting
the original transcript shall bear the costs.
Effect of Zoning Hearing Board's decision. The following time requirements and conditions shall
apply to approvals granted by the Zoning Hearing Board:

The applicant or appellant shall secure all necessary zoning and building permits within
12 months after the approval date of the variance, special exception, or other action of

provided that the applicant or appellant has demonstrated good cause in a written
application to the Zoning Hearing Board.
Should the applicant or appellant fail to obtain all necessary zoning permits within the

applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned the appeal or application; and all
provisions, variances, special exceptions and zoning permits granted shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by the Zoning Hearing Board.

Construction period.
The applicant or appellant shall complete the building, alteration, or use within two years

provided that the applicant or appellant has demonstrated good cause in a written
application to the Zoning Hearing Board.
Should the applicant or appellant fail to complete such construction, alteration, or use

revoke the granted variance, special exception, or zoning permit. The Zoning Officer shall
provide the applicant or appellant with a written notice at least 10 days prior to such
decision of the Zoning Hearing Board. The decision to rescind or revoke such approvals
shall be based on one or more of the following findings of the Zoning Hearing Board:
That there is no good cause for the failure to complete such construction, alteration,
or use within the required time.
That conditions have so changed since the approval of the zoning permit that
revocation of the action is justified.

requirements.
Before voting on the approval of a conditional use, the Board of Supervisors shall hold a
public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. The Board of Supervisors shall submit each
such application to the Township Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing
held upon an application, to provide the Township Planning Commission an opportunity to
review and submit recommendations on the application. A report of said review, together with
any recommendations, shall be given to the Board of Supervisors in writing 30 days from the
date of said referral. If the Township Planning Commission shall fail to file such a report prior
to the hearing in the manner specified, it shall be conclusively presumed that the Township
Planning Commission has approved the application. If, after any public hearing held upon an
application, the proposed application is revised, the Board shall hold another public hearing,
pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on the application.
Public notice shall be given and written notice shall be given to the applicant, the Zoning
Officer, such other persons as the Board of Supervisors shall designate by ordinance, and to
any person who has made timely request for the same. Written notices shall be given at such
time and in such manner as shall be prescribed by ordinance, or in the absence of ordinance
provisions, by rules of the Board of Supervisors. In addition to the written notice provided
herein, written notice of said hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of
land at least one week prior to the hearing.

written decision. No more than two continuances shall be permitted, unless the party
requesting the continuance pays the fee prescribed by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to
resolution.
The Board of Supervisors or the hearing officer may keep a stenographic record of the
proceedings. The appearance fee for a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant
and the Board of Supervisors. The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by the Board of
Supervisors if the transcript is ordered by the Board of Supervisors or hearing officer, or shall
be paid by the person appealing from the decision of the Board of Supervisors if such appeal
is made; and in either event the cost of additional copies shall be paid by the person
requesting such copy or copies. In other cases, the party requesting the original transcript
shall bear the costs.

provided that the applicant or appellant has demonstrated good cause in a written
application to the Board of Supervisors.
Should the applicant or appellant fail to obtain all necessary zoning permits within
the time limitations of this section, it shall be conclusively presumed that the
appellant or applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned the application; and all
provisions, conditional uses, and zoning permits granted shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by the Board of Supervisors.
Construction period.
The applicant or appellant shall complete the building, alteration, or use within two
years after a zoning permit has been issued.
The Board of Supervisors may grant an extension of the two-year construction
period, provided that the applicant or appellant has demonstrated good cause in a

Should the applicant or appellant fail to complete such construction, alteration, or
use within the time limitations of this section, the Board of Supervisors may rescind
or revoke the granted conditional use or zoning permit. The Zoning Officer shall
provide the applicant or appellant with a written notice at least 10 days prior to such
decision of the Board of Supervisors. The decision to rescind or revoke such
approvals shall be based on one or more of the following findings of Board of
Supervisors:
That there is no good cause for the failure to complete such construction,
alteration, or use within the required time.
