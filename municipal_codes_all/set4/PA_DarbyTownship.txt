FOREWORD
History
This comprises the codification of the Ordinances of the Township of Darby. The Town-
ship of Darby was originally settled in 1683 and was incorporated as a First Class
Township before 1926.
The Code of Ordinances of the Township of Darby was prepared by Penns Valley Pub-
lishers and adopted by the Board of Commissioners on October 10, 1990 by Ordinance
number 370.
Organization
The code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of the Township
of Darby contained in chapters 1 through 27, (2) the appendix which lists by abstracted
title all ordinances of a temporary or “one time” nature, (3) the key to the disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the Township, and (4) the index which is an alphabetical
arrangement of subjects.
In the code, each chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific ordinances can be
located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each chapter. The index may
also be used to search for a subject when one is looking for general information on a particular
subject, or if it is not known in which chapter the subject might be found. The appendix consists of several general categories containing a chronological listing of
short subject descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of
enactment if known.
The key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the codifiers and the Board of Commissioners with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An ordinance has
either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another ordinance, (3) is located
in a chapter of the code book, or (4) is located in the appendix. Annual tax rate and
budget ordinances are located only in the key. The key is a cross reference to the original
ordinance books of the Township of Darby, and to the location within the code of
each ordinance by number.

PART 13
CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITY AND ELIGIBILITY
§ 1-1301. Purpose; Conflict With Other Provisions. [Ord. 679, 12/10/2008]
1. The Board of Commissioners of Darby Township recognizes that there is a
need to ensure that all work on public construction and maintenance
contracts is performed by responsible, qualified firms that maintain the
capacity, expertise, personnel, and other qualifications and resources
necessary to successfully perform such contracts in a timely, reliable and
cost-effective manner.
2. To effectuate the purpose of selecting "responsible" contracts for public
contracts and to protect the Township of Darby investments in such
contracts, prospective contractors and subcontractors should be required to
meet preestablished, clearly defined, minimum standards relating to
contractor responsibility. Such standards include requirements and criteria
concerning technical qualifications, competency, experience, adequacy of
resources, including equipment, financial and personnel, and satisfactory
records regarding past project performance, safety, law compliance and
business integrity.
3. Further, due to the critical impact that skilled construction craft labor has
on public works projects, and due to the limited availability of skilled
construction craft labor and imminent craft labor skill shortages, it is
necessary to require contractors and subcontractors to participate in
established, bona fide apprenticeship training programs for the purpose of
both promoting successful project delivery and ensuring future workforce
development. The Township of Darby also recognizes that it is beneficial to
the local community to ensure that firms receiving public contracts provide
adequate wages and benefits to their employees and utilize fair business,
employment and training practices that have a positive impact on the local
communities affected by such contracts.
4. Therefore, the Township of Darby shall require compliance with the
provisions of this Part 13 by business entities seeking to provide services to
Darby Township as specified herein. The requirements of this Part are
intended to supplement, not replace, existing contractor qualification and
performance standards or criteria currently required by law, public policy or
contracting documents. However, in the event that any of the provisions of
this Part conflict with any other law, public policy or contracting documents
of Darby Township, this Part shall prevail.
§ 1-1302. Responsible Contractor Requirements. [Ord. 679, 12/10/2008]

posed on the owner of the dog as the result of any prosecution hereunder, then the
owner shall exhibit proof to the Dog Control Officer that the fine and costs have
been paid in full before the dog shall be delivered to its owner. If the dog is not reclaimed
by the owner at the expiration of the minimum period of 72 hours, then it

tained in custody for any period.
5. If there is any report, evidence or indication that any dog seized has bitten any
person or animal, or if there is any basis to suspect that any dog seized may have the disease of rabies, then the Dog Control Officer shall keep custody of the dog
under close quarantine for a period of not less than 10 days, during which time he
shall make frequent and close observation of the dog for rabies. If there are any
indications that the dog has rabies, then the Dog Control Officer shall cause the dog to be examined by a licensed veterinarian. If, in the opinion of the veterinari-
an, the dog has rabies, then the dog shall be killed and its head shall be forwarded
to a proper testing laboratory for microscopic examination; and if it shall be de-
termined that the dog was suffering from rabies, then any person bitten or who
was suspected of having been bitten shall be immediately warned and advised to
take the Pasteur treatments; provided, however, that it shall not be the obligation
of the Township to pay for said treatments. Any dog or other animal suspected of having been bitten by rabid dog shall be taken into custody of the Dog Control Of-
ficer and shall be held by him in custody for a minimum period of 10 days, subject
to the same investigation by the Dog Control Officer and/or veterinarian for clini-
cal symptoms of rabies; and if rabies develops, then said dog or animal shall be
killed and its head shall be forwarded for microscopic examination. If any dog held
for quarantine shall not develop rabies at the expiration of the quarantine period, the dog may be reclaimed by its owner upon payment of the sum of $10, plus the
cost of maintenance of said dog for the quarantine period; and if said dog is not re-
claimed at the expiration of said quarantine period, it shall be killed as hereinbe-
fore set forth, with record made and report rendered. Nothing herein shall require
that an unlicensed dog be maintained in custody for any period.
6. In any case where a dog was killed at the time of its capture by the Dog Control
Officer and there was any evidence, indication or report that the dog was dis-
eased, the head shall be forwarded to a laboratory for microscopic examination;
and if the examination discloses that the dog was rabid, then due notice of said
fact shall be given to the people of Darby Township through the Darby Township
Police Department.

2. There are deteriorated properties located in the Township of Darby as a
result of neglect by their owners in violation of applicable state and
municipal codes.

on crime and the quality of life of our residents and require significant
expenditures of public funds in order to abate and correct the nuisances.

commitments so as to render themselves unable to abate or correct
the code, statutory and regulatory violations or tax delinquencies.
B. To reduce the likelihood that this municipal City and other
municipalities will have to address the owners' neglect and resulting
deteriorated properties.
C. To sanction the owners for not adhering to their legal obligations to
the Township of Darby, as well as to tenants, adjoining property
owners and neighborhoods.

§ 8-401. Identification. [Ord. 719, 6/10/2015]
1. The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of the Township of Darby classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated November
18, 2009, and September 2, 2015, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study; and
B. Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments, are hereby adopted by Township of Darby and declared to be a
part of this chapter.
§ 8-402. Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain
Areas. [Ord. 719, 6/10/2015]
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM
as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at
any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information for those
special flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall
be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of
the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
8:17 10/14/2015
§ 8-402 DARBY CODE § 8-402
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA
for which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has
been delineated.
(2) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which
base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more
than one foot at any point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any
watercourse unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM
included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available,
the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point
on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
D. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where the
Township of Darby has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as
delineated and adopted on a local flood hazard map using best available
topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record,
historic high-water marks, soils or approximate study methodologies.

The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Commissioners where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to
the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally,
as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special
flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data. See § 8-501, Subsection
2, for situations where FEMA notification is required.
§ 8-404. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. 719, 6/10/2015]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the floodplain administrator, and any party
aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Board of
Commissioners. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 8-405. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes. [Ord. 719, 6/10/2015]
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood
hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The community shall
adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to annexation or corporate
boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT — Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage" or "repetitive loss," regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by

9:7 10/14/2015
§ 9-107 DARBY CODE § 9-107
Township Engineer at the following stages in the development of the site or
of each subdivision thereof:
A. Prior to commencement of grading operations, to determine suitability
of all proposed fill materials.
B. Upon completion of stripping, the stockpiling of topsoil and disposal of
all unsuitable material, but prior to beginning or any other
preparation of the ground.
C. Upon completion of preparation of the ground to receive fill, but prior
to beginning or placement.
D. Upon completion of structural fill placement, such that the following
earth fill procedures are assured:
(1) Prior to placing fill in any area, grading should be performed as
required to provide for drainage. Ditching or filling around the
area should be performed to intercept or divert all surface
water. Within the area on which fill is to be placed, the ground
should be graded so as to provide for unobstructed drainage
from every point to some disposal point.
(2) The area should be closely examined to determine whether
excessive wetness, springs, or other seepage of water can be
observed. If such conditions exist, drainage must be provided
before placement of fill is undertaken.
(3) When the fill area has been prepared as specified, the existing
ground surface should be compacted by the specified method for
compacting fill.
(4) Fill should begin at the lowest section of the area. Fill should
be spread in eight-inch layers prior to compaction. Each layer
should be approximately horizontal, but small slopes can be
permitted in order to provide for surface runoff.
(5) Each layer of fill should be inspected prior to compaction. All
roots, vegetation, or debris should be removed. Stones larger
than 16 inches in diameter should be removed or broken. The
moisture content of each layer should be determined to be
suitable for compaction.
(6) The compaction of the fill should be done with a sheepsfoot
roller, rubber-tired roller or a vibratory roller. Other
compaction equipment should be used only after it has been
demonstrated that satisfactory results can be obtained with it.
(7) Each layer of compacted fill should be tested to determine its
dry density as per ASTM D 1556, when required by the
10/14/2015 9:8
§ 9-107 GRADING AND EXCAVATING § 9-109
Township Engineer. The density of each layer should be not
less than 95% of maximum dry density as determined by ASTM
D 1557. The moisture content of the compacted layer should be
not more than 4% less or 2% greater than the optimum
moisture as determined by ASTM D 1557.
(8) Only when the compacted layer has been shown to be as
specified should other layers of fill be placed above it.
(9) Visual inspection of borrow materials should be made
periodically to assure that no variation in the fill material has
occurred.
E. Upon completion of rough grading, but prior to placing topsoil,
permanent drainage or other site development improvements and
ground covers.
F. Upon completion of trench backfilling operations so that testing can be
performed as specified in Subsection 2D.
G. Upon completion of final grading, permanent drainage and erosion
control facilities, including established ground covers and planting,
and all other work of the permit.
§ 9-108. Costs of Inspections. [Ord. 471, 7/9/1975, Art. 8]
All applicants shall bear all costs of inspections required hereunder and shall
deposit with the Township Treasurer such sums as the Township Board of
Commissioners shall determine, to guarantee payment of the costs of such
inspections. The costs of inspections shall be at the rate charged to the Township by
the Township Engineer.
§ 9-109. Violations. [Ord. 471, 7/9/1975, Art. 10; as amended by Ord. 572,
10/10/1990]
Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of this chapter shall, upon
summary conviction before any District Justice of the Peace, be sentenced to pay a
fine not exceeding $600 and costs of prosecution, or in default of payment thereof
shall be subject to imprisonment for a term of not more than 30 days. Each and
every day in which any person, firm or corporation shall be in violation of this
chapter shall constitute a separate offense.

§ 15-409. Residential Permit Parking. [Ord. 572, 10/10/1990; as amended by
Ord. 573, 11/26/1990; by Ord. 601, 3/9/1994; and by Ord. 689, 12/8/2010]
1. Findings and Purpose. The Township finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Township are subjected to commuter
vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of those areas of
spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic, which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Township considers it to be in the interest of the
people of the Township to provide for the establishment of a
residential permit parking program to ensure primary access to
available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to
provide a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed in this
subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE — A motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR— A person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address; for the purpose of
this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one parking permit for that
business or professional office address.
15:29
MOTOR VEHICLES
5/10/2017
§ 15-409 § 15-409
RESIDENT — A person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address.
RESIDENTIAL AREA — A contiguous area containing public highways or
parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in Subsection 4 of this section are
those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on the
basis of the following criteria:
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the
area is equal to 70% or more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of
the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal parking space shall
be 20 linear feet.
B. During the same period as specified in Subsection 3A directly above,
10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the
area are not registered in the name of a person residing in the area.
For the purpose of this criterion, the latest available information from
the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation regarding registration of motor vehicles
shall be used. In determining that a specific area identified as
impacted and eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a
residential permit parking area, the following factors are taken into
consideration:
(1) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
(2) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in
the Township;
(3) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking
and related health and safety hazards;
(4) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs
in connection with it; and
(6) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the
15:30
DARBY CODE
5/10/2017
§ 15-409 § 15-409
residential permit parking area and used by the general public
for religious, health or educational purposes.
4. Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas.
A. The following are designated as residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)
B. Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions
under which parking shall be by permit only.
5. Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking permit shall be
made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who shall be
only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a
proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other location
within a residential parking permit area. A separate application shall be
required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be accompanied
by a permit fee of $20, which shall be for the use of the Township, to be
applied to the cost of administering the residential permit parking program.
Each application shall contain the following information: the name of the
owner or the driver, as the case may be, of the motor vehicle; the address of
the resident or the proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model and
registration number of the motor vehicle; and the driver number as taken
from the applicant's current driver's license. At the discretion of the Chief of
Police, the applicant shall be required, at the time of making application, to
present his driver's license and the vehicle registration card.
6. Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee, and a
determination by him that the information upon the application shows that
the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of Police
shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid
for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display the serial
and registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential parking
number and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewed annually
before the expiration date, upon making application for renewal and
payment of the permit fee of $20. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this
section for any person to display other than the current and valid permit
while standing or parking in a residential permit parking area at any time
when those permits are to be displayed.
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits
may be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee of $10, to bona
fide visitors of residents of a designated residential permit parking area, and
exemption parking permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to
handicapped persons.

8. Responsibility of Permit Holder.
A. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or
park a motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential
parking area during those times when parking of motor vehicles is
permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential parking
permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be displayed so
as to be clearly visible through the windshield of the vehicle. A
residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder
a parking space within a designated residential permit parking area.
B. A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand or
park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when stopping,
standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for
other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its
holder from the observance of any traffic or parking regulation other
than residential permit parking regulation or restriction.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle
operated; any such use or display by a person other than the permit
holder shall constitute a violation of this section by the permit holder
and by the person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
D. It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person falsely to
represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police in
order to obtain a residential parking permit.
(1) Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority
to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder
found to be in violation of any provision of this section. Upon
written notification to him of the revocation, the permit holder
shall surrender the permit to the Chief of Police. Failure to do
so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of this
section; provided that any person receiving such a notice may,
within 10 days after the date of the notice, appeal to the Board
of Commissioners for a hearing on the revocation, and the
decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be final.

circumstances attending the violation. The police officer or other person making the
report shall also attach to, or place upon, every such vehicle a notice stating that
the vehicle was parked in violation of this Part.
A. The notice shall contain instructions to the owner and/or driver of the vehicle
that if he or she reports to the office of the Chief of Police or special boxes
provided by the Township within 48 hours, the fine will be $15. After 48
hours, the fine increases to $20. After seven days, the fine will be $50.

nually file an exemption certificate with the political subdivision and with
the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to re-
ceive earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemp-
tion certified is filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that officer.
The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the em-
ployee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is re-
questing to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certifi-
cate and until others are instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by Subsection 2B, the employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the ex-
emption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times and
shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The ex-
emption certificate form shall be the form provided by the political subdivi-
sion.
B. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar
year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the political subdivision that the person has received earned income and net
profits from all sources within the political subdivision equal to or in excess
of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to
the person of earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to
or in excess of $12,000 in the calendar year, an employer shall withhold the
local services tax from the person under Subsection 2C.
TAXATION, SPECIAL 24-20 5/13/2009
C. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the tax
becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under Subsection 2B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period af-
ter receipt of the notification under Subsection 2B, a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount
due for that payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a per-
son subject to withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue collection under
this Part.
D. Except as provided in Subsection 2B, it is the intent of this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee from the local
services tax.
3. Refunds. The Township of Darby, in consultation with the collector and DCED,
shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and
interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quar-
ter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No re-
funds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed
$1. The Township of Darby or the collector shall determine eligibility for exemp-
tion and provide refunds to exempt persons.
(Ord. 678, 12/10/2008)
§404. Duty of Employers to Collect.
1. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those employers situ-
ated outside the political subdivision but who engage in business within the politi-
cal subdivision, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of
his employees engaged by him or performing for him within the political subdivision
and making a return and payment thereof to the collector. Further, each em-
ployer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her em-
ploy, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission, and whether
or not all such services are performed within the political subdivision. 2. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro-rata share of
that tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation.
The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be
(24, Part 4)
5/13/2009 24-20.1
determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the
number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For
purposes of determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll basis for each payroll pe-
riod in which the person is engaging in an occupation, except as provided in Sub-
section 4 of this section. For purposes of this subsection, combined rate shall be
the aggregate annual rate of tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
3. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by more than
one political subdivision during each payroll period.
4. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from withholding
the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal employer
that includes the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the
amount of tax withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay statement
is from the employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two weeks of its
occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on the form approved by
the DCED. 5. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year, irrespec-
tive of the number of political subdivisions within which a person may be em-
ployed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment
upon request by the taxpayer.
6. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the failure to withhold
taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the em-
ployee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal office or where
the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for
payment of the local services tax in the amount exceeding the amount withheld by
the employer if the employer complies with the provisions of §403, Subsection 2, of this Part and this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this Part.
7. Employers shall be requested to remit the local services taxes 30 days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 678, 12/10/2008)
§405. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax on
forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector. If an employer fails to file the re-
turn and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes collection thereof from the
salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided
TAXATION, SPECIAL 24-20.2 5/13/2009
hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in
full as though the tax had been originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 678, 12/10/2008)
§406. Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to determine
the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid over to the collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter of each
such tax year.
(Ord. 678, 12/10/2008)
§407. Self-Employed Individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or engages in any occupation with a primary place of employment within the political subdivision
shall be required to comply with this Part and pay the pro-rata portion of the tax due to
the collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 678, 12/10/2008)
§408. Individuals Engaged in More Than One Occupation or Employed in More Than One Political Subdivision.
1. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event a person is en-
gaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent employment, or an occupa-
tion which requires the person working in more than one political subdivision dur-
ing a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in
the following order:
A. First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her prin-
cipal office or is principally employed;
B. Second, the political subdivision in which a person resides and works if the
tax is levied by the political subdivision;
C. Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and which
imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
2. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year de-
claring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certifi-
cation of payment to all other political subdivisions.

5/13/2009 24-20.3
(Ord. 678, 12/10/2008)

outside of the political subdivision but who perform services of any type or kind or en-
gage in any occupation or profession within the political subdivision do, by giving virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and
regulations promulgated under this Part with the same force and effect as though they were residents of the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occu-
pation within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential employer
may, for the purpose of this Part, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event
his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall have the option of proceeding
against either the employer or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter pro-
vided.
(Ord. 678, 12/10/2008)
§410. Administration of Tax.
1. The collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political subdivision. It shall
be the duty of the collector to accept and receive payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him from each employer.
2. The collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement of this Part and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to municipal approval, to proscribe,
adopt and promulgate rules and regulations relating to any matter per-
taining to the administration and enforcement of this Part, including provisions
for the examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this Part, the ex-
amination and correction of any return made in compliance with this Part and
any payment alleged or found to be incorrect as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the collector
shall have the right to appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998.
3. The collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll records of any
employers in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an employer or, if
no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed
and required to give the collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such
examination.

Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other appropriate remedy un-
dertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and li-
able for the costs of collection.

taxing power of the political subdivision under the Constitution of the United
States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
2. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this Part shall be held by any

2. Adult Use Regulations.
A. Purpose and Objectives. Because adult entertainment businesses tend
to bring with them secondary concerns that impact the health, safety
and general welfare of Darby Township, the Township desires to limit
the location where such uses may locate to the LI Light Industrial
District and to enact provisions designed to minimize the impact of
these secondary characteristics on the Township. The Township does
not intend to suppress activities protected by the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution but instead to address these secondary
effects. Neither is it the intent of this § 27-1001, Subsection 2, to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. The
10/14/2015 27:38
§ 27-1001 ZONING § 27-1001
purpose of the provisions in § 27-1001, Subsection 2, is to minimize
these secondary effects which include difficulties for law enforcement,
municipal maintenance, trash, declines in business and residential
property values, increased crime, particularly corruption of the morals
of minors and prostitution, and which encourage residents to move
elsewhere. This section includes permitting requirements for adult
entertainment businesses. The Township of Darby has concluded that
permitting requirements are a legitimate and reasonable means of
accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment
businesses comply with reasonable regulations and do not knowingly
allow their establishments to be used for places of illegal sexual
activity or solicitation.

relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in light of the

within the forty-five-day period above prescribed, the decision shall be deemed to

§ 27-1715. Appeals to the Courts. [Ord. 670, 12/12/2007]
Zoning appeals may be taken to the court by any party before the Board or any
officer or agency of the Township, as provided by law.
§ 27-1715.1. Appeals to the Zoning Hearing Board. [Added by Ord. 711,
12/4/2013]
1. Appeals to the Zoning Hearing Board may be taken by any person aggrieved
or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the Township affected by
any decision of the Building Inspector. Each appeal shall be taken within a
reasonable time as provided by the rules of the Board by filing with the
officer from whom the appeal is taken, and with the Zoning Hearing Board, a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the
appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An
appellant or an applicant for a special exception or for a variance shall, at
27:93 10/14/2015
§ 27-1715.1 DARBY CODE § 27-1718
the time of filing of the appeal or application, pay a filing fee to the
Township Secretary in accordance with the following schedule:
A. For a variance: $850 toward expenses, plus $150 nonrefundable
deposit.
B. For a special exception: $850 toward expenses, plus $150
nonrefundable deposit.
2. If the expenses are less, that amount will be refunded. If expenses are more,
that amount will be assessed to the applicant prior to determination of the
issue.
C. Functions of the Board.
§ 27-1716. Appeals from the Zoning Officer. [Ord. 670, 12/12/2007]
The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that
the Zoning Officer has failed to follow prescribed procedures or has misinterpreted
or misapplied any provision of the Zoning Ordinance or Map.
§ 27-1717. Challenge to the Validity of the Ordinance or Map. [Ord. 670,
12/12/2007]
Except as provided in § 27-1718 relating to variances, the Board shall have no
power to pass upon the validity of any provision of the ordinance or map adopted by
the Commissioners. Recognizing that challenges to the validity of the ordinance or
map may present issues of fact and of interpretation which may lie within the
special competence of the Board, and to facilitate speedy disposition of such
challenges by the Court, the Board may hear all challenges wherein the validity of
the ordinance or map presents any issue of fact or of interpretation, not hitherto
properly determined at a hearing before another competent agency or body, and
shall take evidence and make a record thereon as herein prescribed. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall decide all contested questions of
interpretation and shall make findings on all relevant issues of fact, which shall
become part of the record on appeal to the Court.
§ 27-1718. Variance. [Ord. 670, 12/12/2007]
1. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
appellant. The Board may grant a variance, provided that the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created
10/14/2015 27:94
§ 27-1718 ZONING § 27-1719
by the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located;
B. That because of such physical circumstances or condition, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a
variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property;
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare; and
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification of the
regulation in issue.
2. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions
and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purpose of this
chapter.
§ 27-1719. Special Exceptions. [Ord. 670, 12/12/2007]
1. Where this chapter has provided for stated special exceptions to be granted
or denied by the Board pursuant to express standards and criteria, the Board
shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in accordance with
such standards and criteria. In granting a special exception, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in the Ordinance, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purpose of this act and the Zoning Ordinance.
2. Standards for Review of Special Exceptions.
A. In any instance where the Board is required to consider a request for
a special exception, the Board shall consider the following factors,
where appropriate:
(1) That the proposed use is appropriate for the site in question in
terms of size, topography, natural features, drainage, sewage
disposal, water supply, accessibility, and availability of public
services, and that adequate provisions will be made to protect
sensitive environmental features such as streams, lakes,
wetlands, slopes, and mature trees.
27:95 10/14/2015
§ 27-1719 DARBY CODE § 27-1719
(2) That the proposed use is compatible with the character of the
surrounding neighborhood and will not interfere with or detract
from legitimate uses and adjacent properties, and that
adequate measures will be provided through building design,
site layout, landscaping, planting, and operational controls to
minimize any adverse impacts caused by noise, lights, glare,
odors, smoke, fumes, traffic, parking, loading and signage.
(3) That the proposed special exception will serve the best interests
of the Township, and convenience of the community, and the
public health, safety and welfare.
(4) That the proposed use is consistent with the Darby Township
Comprehensive Plan.
(5) That the proposed use promotes orderly development, proper
population density, and the provision of adequate community
facilities and services, including police and fire protection.
(6) That the proposed use is suitable in terms of its effect on
highway safety and traffic circulation, and that access, on-site
circulation, and parking are adequate in view of anticipated
traffic.
(7) That the proposed use will provide for adequate off-street
parking, as required in Part 13.
B. Financial hardship shall not be construed as a basis for granting
special exceptions.
C. In granting any special exception, the Board may attach reasonable
conditions and safeguards in addition to those expressed in this
Zoning Code as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
the Planning Code and this Zoning Code, which conditions and
safeguards may relate to, but not be limited to screening, lighting, offstreet
parking, noise, safety, aesthetics and the minimization of
noxious, offensive or hazardous elements. Such special exceptions
shall be clearly authorized by the provisions in this Zoning Code and
shall comply with the more specific standards relating to such special
exception contained in sections of this Zoning Code relating to uses by
special exception.
3. Standards of Proof.
A. For Variances. An applicant for a variance shall have the burden of
establishing both:
(1) That a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code
will result in unnecessary hardship, as the term is defined by
law, including court decisions; and
10/14/2015 27:96
§ 27-1719 ZONING § 27-1719
(2) That the allowance of the variance will not be contrary to the
public interest.
B. For Special Exceptions. An applicant for a special exception shall have
the burden of establishing both:
(1) That his application falls within the provisions of this Zoning
Code which affords to the applicant the right to seek a special
exception, and
(2) That the allowance of a special exception will not be contrary to
the public interest.
C. Evaluation of the Impact of an Application on the Public Interest. In
determining whether the allowance of a special exception or variance
is contrary to the public interest, the Board shall consider whether the
application, if granted, will:
(1) Adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare due to
changes in traffic conditions, drainage, air quality, noise levels,
neighborhood property values, natural features, and
neighborhood aesthetic characteristics;
(2) Be in accordance with the Darby Township Comprehensive
Plan;
(3) Provide required parking in accordance with Part 13.
(4) Adversely affect the logical, efficient and economical extension
or provision of public services and facilities such as public
water, sewers, refuse collection, police, fire protection and
public schools.
(5) Otherwise adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare.
4. Expiration of Special Exception and Variances. Unless otherwise specified by
the Board, a special exception or variance shall expire if the applicant fails to
obtain a building permit within six months from the date of authorization
thereof.
5. Conditional Uses Where Specific Dimensional Standards Are Not Provided.
In cases where this Zoning Code does not provide specific dimensional
standards for uses permitted by special exception, the following general
dimensional standards will be applied by the Board of Commissioners:
A. In residential districts, the area, bulk and any other applicable
requirements shall be not less than those for single-family dwellings
in that district or in the next more restrictive district in which singlefamily
dwellings are permitted.
27:97 10/14/2015
§ 27-1719 DARBY CODE § 27-1719
B. In nonresidential districts, the area, bulk and any other applicable
requirements shall be not less than those for the use which requires
the greatest dimensions in the applicable nonresidential district.
C. The governing body may require additional, reasonable but more
stringent requirements than those required herein, provided that the
Board of Commissioners makes one or more of the following
determinations:
(1) Insufficient to accommodate the proposed building, facility, or
use, and that larger dimensional requirements would
substantially alleviate that condition.
(2) Insufficient to provide adequate area for parking and loading,
as required by Part 13, and that larger dimensional
requirements would substantially alleviate that condition.
(3) Insufficient to provide for lot areas and dimensions necessary to
protect the adjacent area from the potential adverse impacts of
the proposed use, such as noise, vibration, air pollution and
similar impacts, and that larger dimensional requirements
would substantially alleviate that condition.
D. All parking requirements of Part 13 must be followed.
6. Regulations for Home Occupations. Home occupations with one employee
shall be permitted in Residential Districts.
A. The occupation (or profession) shall be conducted entirely within the
dwelling and shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the
residential use of the dwelling.
B. Only one occupation per dwelling shall be permitted.
C. Not more than one person other than the resident shall be engaged as
an employee or volunteer.
D. Not more than 25% of the gross floor area of the dwelling shall be
used for the home occupation. Areas used for storage shall be included
in this calculation.
E. No external alterations inconsistent with the residential use shall be
permitted.
F. There shall be no display of materials or products visible from outside
the dwelling.
G. No noise, vibration, smoke, glare or any other impact shall be
noticeable at or beyond the property line.
10/14/2015 27:98
§ 27-1719 ZONING § 27-1719
H. There shall be no outdoor storage of equipment, materials or supplies.
I. Parking shall be provided subject to Part 13.
J. Deliveries from commercial suppliers may not be made more than
once each week and shall not restrict traffic circulation.
K. A home occupation shall in no case be operated before 7:00 a.m. or
after 10:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.
L. All home occupations shall be subject to periodic inspection by a local
official.
M. A special exception shall not be granted when it appears to the Zoning
Hearing Board that the proposed home occupation will constitute a
fire hazard to neighboring residences, will adversely affect
neighboring property value or will constitute a nuisance or otherwise
be detrimental to the neighbors because of excessive traffic, noise,
odor, or other negative circumstances.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
FOR
DARBY TOWNSHKP
December 12, 2007
The Community Development Objectives (CHOs)-listed below are intended and designed to guide and set
the direction for the actual zoning ordinance provisions that will be developed in 2007.
1. Overall Community
Maintain the Township as an attractive and stable community that is pedestrian friendly, contains
distinct and compact neighborhoods and a variety of housing types, commercial, light industrial
and other non-residential establishments.
2. Residential Land Use
a. Provide for and encourage a variety of residential uses including single-family detached,
twins, and small apartments, and apartment developments located near public transit.
b. Ensure blight free neighborhoods by protecting residential areas from physical
deterioration by adoption of property maintenance ordinances and improvement of
inspection and code enforcement programs and procedures.
c. Encourage preservation of residential neighborhoods and discourage erosion of
residential character by unregulated or poorly regulated home occupations, residential
conversions, inappropriate signs, fences and similar uses and structures.
d. Prevent widespread high population density and the accompanying traffic congestion,
parking problems, and undue pressure on schools, recreation, public safety and other
community facilities and services by limiting locations for multi-famiJy and row housing.
Allow higher density development in the form of small apartments and townhouses in
vicinity of public transit and major shopping areas. In this fashion the Township will
direct growth to central areas and stabilize development/limit density in remaining areas.
3. Non-Residential Land Use/Commerce/Industry
a. Encourage the controlled expansion of the light industry and commercial djgtricts
allowing modern, high-tech and low impact light industrial and business uses
representative of the present economic environment.
b. Maintain light industrial districts in good condition through code enforcement and
encouragement of owners/tenants to take measures to comply with codes and ordinances
and make efforts to maintain or improve appearance of buildings and properties.
c. AJ.ong MacDade Boulevard encourage shopping in a centralized area that offer a wide
variety of commercial, retail, and service and micro enterprise uses. Office uses should
generally be allowed only above the first floor .. Auto-related commercial uses should be
located along Hook Road.
4. Housing
a. Maintain existing housing stock and properties so as to prevent deterioration of dwellings
and decline of neighborhoods through a vigorous program of code enforcement.
b. Improve the Township's housing stock by repairing or removing substandard residential
structures and providing new housing in selected areas, as both infill and new
development.
c. Protect residential properties from the impacts of traffic, noise, adjacent industrial and
other high impact uses by regulating permitted uses, landscaping and screening, setback
requirements and other control measures.
d. Maintain the current owner-renter ratio by stopping the increase in the number of new
rental units in comparison to owner-occupied dwellings by initiating marketing efforts
encouraging home-ownership. Explore opportunities in the County Home Ownership
First Program and promote the Township as an attractive community for first-time
buyers.

A. Purpose and Objectives. Because adult entertainment businesses tend to bring with them
secondary concerns that impact the health, safety and general welfare of Darby Township, the
Township desires to limit the location where such uses may locate to the LI-Light Industrial

characteristics on the Township. The Township does not intend to suppress activities protected

of obscene material. The purpose of the provisions in 1201-2 is minimize these secondary
