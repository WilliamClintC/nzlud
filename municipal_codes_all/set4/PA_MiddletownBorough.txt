Borough funds at the discretion of the Borough), and the cost is an

PMRS and for benefits from current and future nonuniformed
employees of the Borough.
B. Further, the Borough acknowledges to the Pennsylvania Municipal
Retirement System responsibility for the Nonuniformed Pension Plan
and assumes responsibility for the providing of all future benefit
payments for the existing retired members and beneficiaries, effective
with the withdrawal from PMRS and return of those funds on deposit at
PMRS.
A. This article hereby establishes a new retirement plan document for the
nonuniformed employees of the Borough of Middletown.34
B. The Borough hereby adopts the Pension Plan document as prepared by
StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. ("Stancorp"), and its wholly owned
subsidiaries: Standard Insurance Company and The Standard Life
Insurance Company of New York.
C. Upon termination of the contractual relationship between the Borough
and PMRS and the transfer of the pension assets herein described, the
PMRS plan documentation shall no longer be effective, but rather, the
plan document drafted by Stancorp shall be the controlling document.
The Borough of Middletown Nonuniformed Pension Plan shall at no
time in this process be terminated, but rather, its features shall be
described in a new plan document and the related funds will be held by
Stancorp in place of PMRS. The Borough hereby authorizes the transfer
of all funds, to the extent that such transfer is required, from PMRS, the
present custodian of the pension funds, to the successor custodian of
funds, Stancorp Financial Group, Inc., via direct transfer.
D. Amendments to Stancorp plan document. [Added 4-13-2010 by Ord.
No. 1266, approved 4-13-201035]
(1) In order to clarify the calculation of the cost-of-living adjustment,
the Stancorp plan document referred to above shall be amended to
delete the existing plan Section 7.7 and to replace it with the
following:
34.Editor's Note: The Nonuniform Pension Plan document is available in the office of the
Borough Secretary.
35.Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided that benefit changes calculated hereunder, if
any, would be retroactive to 1-1-2010 and would be paid in accordance with past practices
in the plan.

§ 55-16. Deposits in good standing.
The Borough hereby certifies to the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement
System that all deposits at PMRS are sufficient to cover anticipated
expenses as determined by actuarial studies compliant with the
requirements of Act 205, (53 P.S. § 895.101 et seq.). Should the deposits
be shown to be insufficient, the Borough shall assume responsibility for the
collection and contribution of funds necessary for the Pension Plan pursuant
to the requirements of Act 205.
§ 55-17. Collective bargaining agreement; savings provision;
repealer; effective date.
7.7. Normal retirement benefit cost-of-living adjustment
(COLA).
A post-retirement COLA shall be applied to the amount of any
normal retirement benefit of each retired participant, surviving
spouse or other beneficiary. The adjustment shall be made as of
the anniversary of each participant's annuity starting date, which
shall be referred to as the "adjustment date."
The annual adjustment shall be determined by a percentage equal
to the consumer price index (CPI) (Urban Wage Earners and
Clerical Workers) for the fourth month prior to the beginning of
the current plan year divided by the CPI for the fourth month prior
to the immediately preceding plan year. This percentage, rounded
to the nearest 0.1%, shall be multiplied by the current benefit level
to determine the benefit level commencing at the adjustment date.
In any event, the COLA shall be limited to a maximum annual
increase of 3% and a maximum total increase of 30%. In no event
shall the COLA cause a reduction in benefit.
In the event that an individual would have otherwise been subject
to a negative adjustment for the 2010 adjustment date due to
the preceding calculation (meaning that the CPI decreased during
the measurement period), no adjustment shall be made to the
normal retirement benefit on that adjustment date. The COLA
for the subsequent adjustment date shall be calculated on the
basis of the CPI from the fourth month preceding the subsequent
anniversary date divided by the CPI on the fourth month preceding
the anniversary date of the last plan year which produced a
positive adjustment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this plan, the intent of this paragraph is to prevent a negative
COLA adjustment for the 2010 adjustment date only. This
paragraph shall not operate to prevent a negative COLA
adjustment for any adjustment date subsequent to 2010.
This shall be calculated as a compound interest COLA.
The COLA shall be recognized in any lump sum payments made
under the plan.
§ 55-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-17
1:65
A. Nothing in this article shall in any way amend or repeal any clause or
part of the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the
Borough and Local 776 Teamsters.
B. In the event that any provision, section, sentence, clause or part of this
article or the Pension Plan document, shall be held to be invalid, such
invalidity shall not affect or impair any remaining provision, section,
sentence, clause or part of this article or the Pension Plan document, it
being the intent of the Borough that such remainder shall be and
remain in full force and effect.
C. All prior ordinances or parts of ordinances which are inconsistent
herewith are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
D. Contingent upon the approval of the withdrawal of the Borough from
PMRS and contingent upon the execution of the aforementioned
agreement between the Borough and PMRS, this article shall be
effective immediately.36

Establishment and Administration
[Adopted 4-2-2019 by Ord. No. 1360, approved 4-2-2019]
§ 84-1. Establishment.
There shall be established in the Borough of Middletown (hereinafter the
"Borough") a stabilization fund pursuant to the authority set forth in 8
Pa.C.S.A. § 1202(23) for the creation of an operating reserve fund and 8
Pa.C.S.A. § 1313.1 for the creation of special funds and investments. The
Borough shall set aside money in the stabilization fund for the payment of
unforeseen and unfunded emergency expenses of the Borough related to
the health, safety and welfare of Borough residents. The administration,
control, investment and expenditure of the stabilization fund by Borough
Council shall be in accordance with this chapter.
§ 84-2. Administration.
A. Deposits.
(1) The stabilization fund shall be funded by annual contributions from
the Borough's general fund and electric fund. Transfers shall be
made to the stabilization fund from the general fund and electric
fund each year that there is an end-of-year surplus in either or both
contributing funds. A transfer equal to 10% of each fund's surplus
shall be made after receipt by the Borough of the audited financial
statements for the fiscal year for which there was a year-end
surplus.
(2) There shall be no maximum placed on the total stabilization fund
balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to 8 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 1202(23), no appropriation may be made to the stabilization fund
if said appropriation would cause the stabilization fund balance to
exceed 25% of the estimated revenues of the Borough's general
fund in the current fiscal year.
B. Expenditures. Payments out of the stabilization fund shall be for
unforeseen and unfunded emergency expenses of the Borough related
to the health, safety and welfare of Borough residents. Such
expenditures are those that would result in significant unanticipated
revenue shortfalls if paid out of the general fund. Stabilization funds
may also be used for any lawful municipal purpose under the
Pennsylvania Borough Code, 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq. Consistent with
Council's authority set forth in 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 1313.1 to expend funds in
the manner as may be determined by action of Council under this
article, a majority vote of all elected Borough Council members plus one
is required to spend money out of the stabilization fund for the payment
of authorized expenses.

C. Investments. Money deposited into the stabilization fund shall be

§ 132-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Curfew Ordinance."
§ 132-2. Purposes and findings.
This is an updating of the Borough Curfew Ordinance of 1943 prescribing,
in accordance with prevailing community standards, regulations for the
conduct of minors on streets at night, effectively enforced, taught in the
homes, internalized and adhered to for generations, all for the good of
minors, for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public good,
safety and welfare.
A. The Council finds that the curfew meets a very real local need, has
been, over the years, a significant factor in minimizing juvenile
delinquency and should be updated and amplified in the light of
Middletown's local situation and facts, including the following.
Middletown, the oldest community in (and antedating) Dauphin County,
with clearly defined boundaries at the confluence of the Susquehanna
River and Swatara Creek to its south and east and crossed at the north
by the Pennsylvania Turnpike, has a compact built up area largely
within a mile, and much of it within a half mile, of its Police Station at
the 60 West Emaus Street Borough offices. It has, near its Police
Station, a small central business district and a few manufacturing
establishments. It is a residential community in an area traditionally
classified as Pennsylvania Dutch. After 9:00 p.m. in this quiet
community, as its people say, the sidewalks are rolled up. This
community sense of the proper time for cessation of outdoor activities
by minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours declared by
this chapter, which take into consideration also the danger hours for
nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks
incident to immaturity.
B. The Council finds that compact Middletown is not overcrowded.
Population density, as reflected in the Borough Comprehensive Plan,
varies by neighborhoods from 43.7 per acre to 35 to 18.4 persons per
acre. The total area is 1,304.7 acres; streets occupy 228.8 acres, 163.8
acres are devoted to public and semipublic uses, residential land use
predominates and single-family dwellings occupy the largest portion of
§ 127-23 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 132-2
1:136

the residential area. The population density is 30 persons per acre in
that portion of the Second Ward in eastern Middletown south of East
Main Street, overlooking the Swatara Creek, now known as the Village
of Pineford, a fifty-acre tract which the United States Government had
acquired, while still undeveloped, by eminent domain proceedings in
1941; this unique fifty-acre tract is a planned residential development,
with high-rise apartments, all owned by one firm, providing ample open
spaces. Adequate indoor living space permits minors in Middletown to
healthfully occupy their time. Commercial recreational facilities (one
movie) are almost nonexistent, and there is little or nothing for minors
to do outdoors, but roam the streets, after the curfew hours which this
chapter declares. [Amended 8-8-1983 by Ord. No. 863, approved
8-8-1983]
C. The Council finds that there are 2,841 minors, the 1970 census figure
for persons under 18 years of age, residing in Middletown. There are
fewer than 200 minors for each school grade. Middletown has three
elementary schools, one in each of its three wards, one junior high
school for Grades 7 and 8 in the central Second Ward, and one area
high school in Lower Swatara Township which adjoins Middletown on
the west and north. The comparatively few minors who reside in the
Village of Pineford include 32 in high school and (attending the
following schools nearby in the same Second Ward) 25 in junior high
and 112 in elementary school.
D. The Council further finds that the Middletown population (1970 census)
is 9,080. There are 3,059 households (averaging two and 2.96 persons
per household) and as many heads of households. In 2,069 households
there are husband and wife. Of the 2,841 minors, 2,686 are classified in
the 1970 census as "own child" of the head of the household in which
they reside. Middletown is a stable family community. Parental
responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm; legal
sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated
effectiveness over the years; as parental control increases, the
likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases; and there is a continuing
need for the nocturnal curfew for minors, which has achieved and will
continue to achieve, under local conditions, the purposes hereinbefore
stated.
A. For the purposes of the Curfew Ordinance, the following terms,
phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given
herein:
BOROUGH  The Borough of Middletown, Dauphin County,
Pennsylvania, with administrative offices at 60 West Emaus Street,
Middletown, Pennsylvania 17057.
MINOR  Any person under the age of 18 or, in equivalent phrasing
often herein employed, any person 17 or fewer years of age.
§ 132-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-3
1:137
PARENT  Any person having legal custody of a minor:
REMAIN  To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the
streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors)
totaling four or more persons, in which any minor involved would not
be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes, such as mere
passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional
precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined
in § 132-5. More and more exceptions become available with increasing
years as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which
is intended by use of the meaningful phrase "be or remain" found
constitutional in Baker v. Borough of Steelton, 17 Dauph. 17
(1912).[Amended 5-9-1977 by Ord. No. 701, approved 5-9-1977]
STREET  A way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the
public for purposes of vehicular travel or, in the case of a sidewalk
thereof, for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal rightof-
way, including but not limited to the cartway of traffic lanes, the
curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots
or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. The
term "street" also applies, for curfew purposes, to ways the public is
privileged to use over private property so long as the owner permits,
including sidewalks and grassplots similarly open at the time to public
use, and to parking areas of any type (residential, municipal or
commercial) open to public use or from such "street" or any type of
street. The term "street" applies irrespective of what it is called or
formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, road or otherwise, or
whether it is maintained by the Borough and irrespective of whether
it is open to the use of the public as a matter of right.[Amended
8-8-1983 by Ord. No. 863, approved 8-8-1983]
TIME OF NIGHT  Based upon the prevailing standard of time,
whether Eastern standard time or Eastern daylight saving time,
generally observed at that hour by the public in the Borough, prima
facie the time then observed in the Borough administrative offices and
Police Station.
YEAR OF AGE  Continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth,
to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the eighteenth
birthday, making it clear that 17 or fewer years of age is herein treated
as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of age," the latter phrase in
practice, unfortunately, having confused a number of persons into the
mistaken thought that eighteen-year olds might be involved. Similarly,
for example, 11 or fewer years of age means "under 12 years of age."
(1) As a natural or adoptive parent;
(2) As a legal guardian;
(3) As a person who stands in loco parentis; or
As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of
court.

§ 132-3 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 132-3
1:138
§ 132-4. Curfew for minors established.
It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or fewer years of age (under 18) to be
or remain in or upon the streets within the Borough of Middletown at night
during the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning:
§ 132-5. Exceptions.
B. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense
include the future, words in the plural number include the singular, and
words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is
always mandatory and not merely directory.
A. At 10:00 p.m. for minors 11 or fewer years of age.
B. At 10:30 p.m. for minors 12 years or 13 years of age.
C. At 11:00 p.m. for minors 14 or more years of age.
A. In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a street within the
Borough during the nocturnal hours for which § 132-4 is intended to
provide the maximum limits of regulation (and a clear general guide for
minors, their parents and their fellow citizens) shall not, however, be
considered in violation of the Curfew Ordinance: [Amended 5-9-1977
by Ord. No. 701, approved 5-9-1977; 8-8-1983 by Ord. No. 863,
approved 8-8-1983]
(1) When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
(2) When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such
minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a
designated period of time and purpose within a specified area.
(3) When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom
of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the
bona fides of such exercise by first delivering to communications
center personnel at the Borough Municipal Building at 60 West
Emaus Street, where and by whom high priority messages to the
Mayor are regularly received, a written communication, signed by
such minor and countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of such
minor, with their home address and telephone number, addressed
to the Mayor of the Borough, specifying when, where and in what
manner said minor will be on the streets at night (during hours
when the Curfew Ordinance is otherwise applicable to said minor)
in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such
communication.
(4) In case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent
has communicated to the Borough Police Station personnel the
facts establishing such reasonable necessity, relating to specified
streets at a designated time for a described purpose, including
§ 132-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-5
1:139
points of origin and destination. A copy of such communication, or
of the police record thereof, duly certified by the Chief of Police to
be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received
and of the names and address of such parent and minor, shall be
admissible evidence.
(5) When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not
communicating an objection to the police officer.
(6) When returning home, by a direct route from (and within 30
minutes of the termination of) a school activity or an activity of a
religious or other voluntary association of which prior notice,
indicating the place and probable time of termination, has been
given in writing to and duly filed for immediate reference by the
Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the Police
Station, thus encouraging (here as in other exceptional situations)
conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities and
striking a fair balance for any somewhat conflicting interests.
(7) When authorized, by special permit from the Mayor, carried on the
person of the minor thus authorized, as follows. When necessary
nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by
other provisions of this chapter, then recourse may be had to the
Mayor of the Borough, either for a regulation as provided in
Subsection A(8) or for a special permit as the circumstances
warrant. Upon the Mayor's finding of necessity for the use of the
streets to the extent warranted by a written application (as
judicially approved in People v. Walton, 161 P.2d 498, 502-503, Cal.
App. 1945), signed by a minor and by a parent of such minor, if
feasible, stating the name, age and address of such minor; the
name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof; the
height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical
characteristics of such minor; the necessity which requires such
minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours
otherwise applicable; and the street or route and the beginning and
ending of the period of time involved by date and hour, the Mayor
may grant a permit, in writing, for the use by such minor of such
streets at such hours as, in the Mayor's opinion, may reasonably be
necessary. In an emergency, this may be handled by telephone or
other effective communication, with a corresponding record being
made contemporaneously, either to the Mayor or, if unavailable, to
the police officer authorized by the Mayor to act on his behalf in an
emergency at the Police Station.
(8) When authorized, by regulation issued by the Mayor, in other
similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted
to necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily
be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such
regulation by the Mayor permitting use of the streets should be
issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity
§ 132-5 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 132-5
1:140
through news media and through other agencies such as the
schools and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the
streets permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more
than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity,
and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably
necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this Curfew
Ordinance.
(9) When the minor carries a certified card of employment, renewable
each calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or
reissued not more than 45 days previously, signed by the Chief of
Police, and briefly identifying the minor, the addresses of his home
and of his place of employment and his hours of employment.
(10) When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly
exempts bona fide interstate movement through Middletown,
particularly on normal routes such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike,
Route 230 (Main Street), Vine Street to connect with Route 283,
Route 441 or, at times, Ann Street and the Wilson Street bridge.
This also exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in
Middletown.
(11) When the minor is 17 years of age, if and when the Mayor shall
have determined, by formal rule first reported to the Borough
Council, spread upon its minutes and so reported in the press,
finding the facts as to the extent (minimal) of juvenile delinquency
in such age group permitting such rule, currently, in the best
interest of said minors and of the Borough, then the Mayor, by such
formal rule, covering a period of time designated therein or until
recision thereof, not exceeding one year from the date thereof, may
take appropriate action excepting designated minors, minors in a
defined group or area or all minors (as the current facts may
warrant) 17 years of age at the date or attaining 17 years of age
during the period that such formal rule is and remains in effect.
B. Each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations, such as
provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided but
here reemphasized; and additional, also severable, exceptions,
broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled
respectively in elementary, junior high and high schools, will be
considered by the Council as warranted by future experience
illuminated by the views of student government associations; school
personnel; citizens; associations; ward, precinct and neighborhood
spokesmen; parents; officers; and persons in authority concerned
positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
§ 132-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-6
1:141
§ 132-6. Parental responsibility. [Amended 8-8-1983 by Ord. No.
863, approved 8-8-1983]
It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly
to permit or by inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain
upon any street within the Borough under circumstances not constituting an
exception to or otherwise beyond the scope of the Curfew Ordinance. The
term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be
expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's
legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless
parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility
through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was
completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such
minor.
§ 132-7. Police procedures.
A. A policeman of the Borough, upon finding or having attention called to
any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the Curfew
Ordinance, normally shall take the minor to the Borough Police Station,
where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor,
whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts and to
centralize responsibility in the Sergeant there and then on duty for
accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and
recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel,
the best of facilities and access to information and records. In the
absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth certificate, a policeman
on the street shall, in the first instance, use his best judgment in
determining age.
B. Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience
and may provide, inter alia, that the policeman may deliver to a parent
thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a minor
of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be
ascertained or are known.
C. In any event, such policeman shall, within 24 hours, file a written report
with the Chief of Police or shall participate, to the extent of the
information for which he is responsible, in the preparation, by himself
and the Sergeant involved in such case, and in the filing of such report
within 24 hours.
D. When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor
shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be
located or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be
released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that, in
accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile
authorities, the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative,
neighbor or other person who will, on behalf of a parent, assume the
§ 132-6 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 132-7
1:142
§ 132-8. Violations and penalties.
Prevailing community standards and the real internalization thereof or
interpersonal sanctions therefor that, in practice, count for much, as to
when minors should be off the streets, reflected in this Curfew Ordinance,
are hereby undergirded with the following legal sanctions.
§ 132-9. Construal of provisions.
Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of the Curfew
Ordinance. If any provision, including inter alia any exception, part, phrase
or term or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held
invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby, and the validity of the Curfew Ordinance, in any and all
other respects, shall not be affected thereby. From excess of caution, the
Mayor is authorized to give advisory opinions, in writing or immediately
reduced to writing, which shall be binding and shall be adhered to by
responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival
of a parent.
E. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police shall, by
certified mail, send to a parent written notice of said violation, with a
warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the Curfew Ordinance, including enforcement of parental responsibility
and of applicable penalties.
A. If, after the warning notice pursuant to § 132-7 of a first violation by a
minor, a parent violates § 132-6 (in connection with a second violation
by said minor), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For
such first parental offense, a parent shall be fined $25, and for each
subsequent offense by a parent, the fine shall be increased by an
additional $25 (e.g., $50 for the second, $75 for the third offense). The
District Justice, upon finding a parent guilty, shall sentence the parent
to pay such fine and the costs of prosecution and, upon refusal to pay
such fine and costs, to be imprisoned in the jail of Dauphin County for a
period not exceeding 10 days.
B. Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of the Curfew
Ordinance more than three times shall be reported by the Mayor to a
society or organization whose purpose it is to take charge of
incorrigibles and delinquents, and proceedings shall then be taken,
under the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301 et seq., before the juvenile
court for the treatment, supervision and rehabilitation of such minor.
[Amended 4-6-1987 by Ord. No. 943]
C. A like procedure before the juvenile authorities shall be followed in any
case where the imposing of a fine or fines upon a parent shall not be
effective or where, for any other reason, the provisions of the Curfew
Ordinance cannot be made effective by the imposing of penalties under
this section.
§ 132-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-9
1:143
the police until the ordinance is amended in such respect, interpreting
terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally such advisory opinions
shall be in response to good faith, signed letters, addressed to him at the
Borough administration building, questioning as ambiguous, as having a
potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights specifically invoked or as
otherwise invalid, in all three categories with respect to proposed conduct
definitely described. This administrative remedy must be exhausted prior
to presenting to any court a question in any of said three categories.
The Borough Council does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible
of execution or unreasonable. It is intended that the Curfew Ordinance
be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would
be unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall
be given. The Council does not intend to violate the Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the Constitution of the United States of
America.
§ 132-10. Continuing evaluation.
The Borough Council will continue its evaluation and updating of the
Curfew Ordinance.
A. Accordingly, there shall be compiled and informally reported to the
Borough Council through effective channels (such as the normal
monthly distribution by the Borough Manager and Borough Secretary
to each Councilman, the Mayor and the Borough Solicitor of noteworthy
material) all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the
notices of school and other activities, the Mayor's special permits and
the Mayor's regulations hereinbefore authorized, and the Mayor's
advisory opinions, for consideration by the appropriate committee and
by the Borough Council in further updating and continuing evaluation
of the Curfew Ordinance.
B. For the same reasons, as well as for the implementation beyond these
legal aspects of the basic purposes hereof, the Mayor and relevant
committees of the Borough Council, through their respective Chairmen,
in coordinated efforts, shall work with existing and may organize
voluntary groups and shall stimulate volunteer leadership in programs
of research and of action dealing constructively, on neighborhood and
local bases, with juvenile delinquency and the prevention, control or
containment thereof in all its ramifications and with practicable steps
toward the good life and a better life for minors 17 or fewer years of age
and with the working of the Curfew Ordinance, community-wise and in
individual cases, as one much needed legal tool toward that end as well
as for continuing present protection of minors and of other persons and
of property and other interests important to the welfare of the people of
the Borough of Middletown.

Borough policeman, of a violation of this chapter, upon the person in
charge of such head shop and/or upon the owner, lessee or occupant of
the establishment, premises, place or location, or agent thereof, such
violation shall be discontinued immediately to protect the compelling
public interest in the preservation of residential neighborhoods, to

minors, schoolchildren and other susceptible persons to the deleterious
effects of drugs with accompanying adverse consequences to the
community.

§ 144-26. Flat rates or special rates prohibited. [Added 5-10-1926]
There shall be no flat rates and no special rates granted by the Borough of
Middletown to any consumer. All consumers of electric current furnished by
the Borough of Middletown shall fall within the provisions of this chapter
and shall be charged the rates fixed by this chapter.
§ 144-27. Delinquent bills. [Added 11-14-1962 by Ord. No. 436,
approved 11-15-1962; last amended 6-5-2006 by Ord. No. 1208,
approved 6-5-2006]
The purpose of this chapter is to recover delinquent charges from
customers. Unpaid electric bills unfairly force increases in rates to good
customers. Customers are required to pay for all electric current registered
by their electric meters, without exception.
A. Electric bills will be due and payable within 15 days of the date billed, in
accordance with Article I of Chapter 108, Bills for Borough Services. A
late payment penalty of 10% of the amount unpaid will be added to all
bills which remain unpaid after the due date.
B. At any time after the 27th day following the issuance of the bill, should
the account remain delinquent in an amount greater than $50, notice of
such delinquency and termination of service will be mailed to the
customer at the billing address. [Amended 11-15-2011 by Ord. No.
1279, approved 11-15-201165]
C. Throughout all seasons, the same disconnection policy shall apply,
except that the Electric Department shall affix a notice of service
termination to the service location at least 48 hours prior to service
disconnection during the months of October through March.
D. At any time after the 38th day following the issuance of the bill, should
the account continue to remain delinquent in an amount greater than
$50, it shall be the duty of the Electric Department, as herein
authorized by the Borough Council, to terminate electric service and to
inform the Borough Code Enforcement Office so that a notice of
uninhabitable residence can be affixed to service location and all
residents referred to sources of alternate habitation.
E. Failure of the U.S. Postal Service to deliver any or all of the abovereferenced
notices, or failure to show proof that the Electric
Department affixed a termination notice at the service location, does
not constitute grounds for continuation of service for a delinquent
account.
F. Medical extension:
65.Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former Subsection B, regarding notice of
delinquent accounts after the 15th day following the issuance of a bill, and provided for
the renumbering of former Subsections C through H as Subsections B through G,
respectively.

late penalty, along with a reconnection charge of $60. In addition, a
security deposit shall be required. Payment shall be made to the
Borough no later than 3:00 p.m. on a regular Borough working day. No
service disconnected for delinquency will be reconnected after 3:00

§ 148-8. Collection of attorney fees. [Added 7-8-2008 by Ord. No.

A. Legislative intent. By Act 1 of 1996, the General Assembly amended the
Municipal Claim and Tax Lien Law of May 16, 1923, P.L. 207, as
amended and supplemented, 53 P.S. §§ 7101 through 7505, to
specifically authorize inclusion of attorney fees incurred in the
collection of delinquent accounts as part of a municipal lien. Act 1
requires that municipalities by ordinance adopt a schedule of attorney
fees. Act 1 further requires that, prior to imposing attorney fees, the
municipality must notify, by certified mail, the owner of the property
with the delinquent account of the municipality's intent to recover these
fees and the manner by which assessment of the fees may be avoided by
payment of the delinquent account. It is the intention of the Borough
Council in enacting this section to comply with the requirements of Act
1 of 1996.
B. Definitions. Unless otherwise stated, the following words shall, for the
purpose of this section, have the meanings herein indicated:
BOROUGH  The Borough of Middletown, Dauphin County,
Pennsylvania.
BOROUGH SOLICITOR  The persons or law firm appointed by the
Borough Council to serve as legal counsel to the Borough.
DELINQUENT ACCOUNT  Any sums due and owing to the Borough
which have not been paid within the time required by the Borough's
ordinances, resolutions, rules, regulations or policies, including, but not
limited to, charges for trash collection, sewer service, water service,
electric service, removal or abatement of nuisances, taxes, municipal
improvements, or any other charge which may lawfully be imposed by
the Borough and for which a municipal claim may be filed.
HOURLY RATE  The hourly fee charged, by the Borough Solicitor to
the Borough consistent with the ordinary and customary charges by the
Borough Solicitor for similar services in the community, but in no event
shall the hourly rate exceed the rate charged by the Borough Solicitor
§ 148-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 148-8
1:165
to the Borough when fees are not reimbursed by or otherwise imposed
upon delinquent customers of the Borough.
C. Imposition of attorney fees for collection of delinquent accounts. The
Borough Council specifically authorizes the recovery of attorney fees
incurred by the Borough in the collection of delinquent accounts from
the person or persons who are responsible for the payment of such
delinquent accounts. The Borough Council authorizes the Borough
Manager, the Finance Director, or the Assistant Borough Manager to
take all actions required by applicable law to enable the Borough to
recover attorney fees incurred from the persons responsible for this
cost and to include such attorney fees in municipal claims. This
authorization includes, but is not limited to, sending notification to such
persons of the intention of the Borough to impose attorney fees
incurred in collection efforts upon such persons.
D. Schedule of attorney fees for services related to collection of delinquent
accounts. The Borough shall impose attorney fees upon persons who
have delinquent accounts in accordance with the following schedule:
Service
Minimum Time
(hours)

E. Recovery of additional attorney fees in specific circumstances. The
services and minimum times expended by the Borough Solicitor for the
services set forth in § 148-8D of this chapter are based upon the
experiences of the Borough Solicitor and upon standard collection
practices. Should the person or persons responsible for payment of a
delinquent account take action or should other circumstances occur
which will require the Borough Solicitor to perform additional or more
time-consuming services than contemplated by § 148-8D, it is the
intention of the Borough to recover all of its attorney fees so incurred.
Such actions include, but are not limited to, filing of counterclaims,

§ 153-1. Statement of findings.
In Middletown there are fire lanes, with a minimum width of 11 feet,
duly marked with red lines and posted with no-parking signs, at such
representative places as the Church of God, Essex House, Genesis Court,
Hemlock Hall, Holly Hall, Interfaith Apartments, Midtown Plaza, the Moose
Building and Frey Village Center.
challenging the legal power of the Borough to impose and collect the
fee, rate, charge or other cost, or similar actions.
A. For years, authorization therefor appeared in the duly adopted Fire
Prevention Code recommended by the American Insurance Association,
successor to the National Board of Fire Underwriters, most recently in
the edition of 1970 at page 209 in Section 28.16, headed "Fire Lanes on
Private Property, Devoted to Public Use" and providing as follows:
"a. The marking of fire lanes on private property devoted to public use,
shall be approved by the Chief of the Bureau of Fire Prevention and the
Chief of Police."
§ 148-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-1
1:167
§ 153-2. Designation of fire lanes.
The Chief Fire Marshal shall have the power to designate fire lanes
anywhere within the Borough of Middletown, on public or private property,
where he deems that parking congestion may create a hazard by impeding
the free movement of firefighting equipment. In formulating such
designations, he shall consult with the Chief of Police and may consult with
but shall report in writing to the appropriate committee of the Borough
Council. Such fire lanes, length determined by the Fire Marshal's office,
shall be marked with red lines in such a fashion as to indicate their location
and posted with no-parking signs. Parking of motor vehicles or otherwise
obstructing fire lanes shall be prohibited at all times. Existing fire lanes and
no-parking signs are hereby confirmed, validated and approved.
§ 153-3. Enforcement.
The Chief Fire Marshal shall prescribe and issue all forms necessary for
the administration of this chapter and may adopt and enforce regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration thereof, including
but not limited to the imposition and collection of fines for violations. The
Chief Fire Marshal may designate his office and assistants, the Borough
police, the private property owner's security force, the fire police and other
persons to enforce all provisions concerning fire lanes, either singly or
conjunction with some or all others named or alluded to.
§ 153-4. Violations and penalties. [Amended 5-3-2004 by Ord. No.
1178, approved 5-3-2004]
Any person who parks or permits to be parked a motor vehicle within a
fire lane or otherwise obstructs a fire lane violates these provisions for fire
lanes and shall be subject to penalties as herein described. A fine in an
"b. Parking of motor vehicles or otherwise obstructing fire lanes shall
be prohibited at all times."
B. Such fire lanes were applicable (see page 247) "where the parking of
motor vehicles or other obstructions may interfere with the ingress and
egress of Fire Department vehicles for the protection of persons and
property, such as at shopping centers, bowling lanes, theaters,
hospitals, churches and similar locations."
C. While it has recently been discovered that such authorization
inadvertently lapsed with the adoption of the BOCA Basic Fire
Prevention Code by the former Middletown Code of Ordinances,
Chapter VIII, Section 18, enforcement has continued, and continuing
compliance has confirmed the teachings or experience evidenced also
by Fire Lane Ordinance No. 1975-9 in adjoining Lower Swatara
Township, that the designation of fire lanes is necessary in the public
interest whenever it appears that parking congestion may create a
hazard by impeding the free movement of firefighting equipment on
public or private property.

amount set forth in a fee schedule setting fees and charges as approved by
resolution of Borough Council shall be imposed for each violation and shall
be collected by the Chief Fire Marshal or by a ticketing procedure whereby
the fine may be paid at the Middletown Emergency Operations Center or
other designated place of payment. If payment is not made within 48 hours,
the fine shall be increased to an amount set forth in said fee schedule. If the
fine is not paid within 10 days, the Chief Fire Marshal, or a Borough police
officer authorized by the Chief Fire Marshal, shall prosecute the violator
before a District Justice. If such prosecution is necessary, the violator shall,
upon conviction, pay a fine set forth in said fee schedule, plus costs. In
default of payment of such fine and costs, the violator may be sentenced to
imprisonment in the Dauphin County Jail or other appropriate prison for not
more than 30 days.

extinguished, immediately to cause notice of the existence of such fire,
circumstances of the same and the location thereof to be given to the local

shall be narrowly construed and shall mean a dwelling unit consisting of
one or more rooms used for living and sleeping purposes and having a

any premises or building (except a private dwelling, as aforesaid) without
consent of the occupant or of anyone during business or operating hours
and also at any time in any emergency that immediately endangers life,
property or public safety for the purpose of performing their duties,
including law enforcement. Such right to enter without consent, as applied
to multiple dwellings, shall relate to those spaces to which the public or
any one of the several occupants is ordinarily admitted, such as hallways,
basements and similar spaces. Any private dwelling as aforesaid may be
entered by such authorities during or immediately following an emergency,
such as a fire, explosion or the like, or upon first obtaining a search warrant
or with the consent of any occupant of such private dwelling.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 158-1. Statutory authorization.
The legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,71 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Borough Council of the Borough of Middletown
does hereby order as follows.
§ 158-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 158-3. Applicability.
§ 158-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough of Middletown unless a
permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
B. A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or
structures.

§ 158-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 158-5
1:181
§ 158-5. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
§ 158-6. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Middletown or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

C. Supplemental floodplain areas are areas not identified in the FIS but
where Borough of Middletown has determined the area to merit
additional regulation under this chapter. These areas are identified on
the Borough of Middletown supplemental floodplain identification map.
A. Floodway area.
(1) Description.
(a) The area identified as floodway in the FIS, which represents
the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that
must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point.
(b) This term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood
heights shall be prohibited.
(b) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
B. Special floodplain area.
§ 158-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 158-19
1:191
(1) Description. The areas identified as Zones AE and A1-30 in the FIS,
which are subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance
flood event determined by detailed methods and have base flood
elevations (BFEs) shown.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top of bank of
any watercourse.
(b) In special floodplain areas without a designated floodway, no
new development shall be permitted unless it can be
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and
projected development will not increase the BFE by more than
one foot.
C. Approximate floodplain area.
(1) Description. The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS, which are
subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood event
determined using approximate methodologies. Because detailed
hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no BFEs or flood
depths are shown.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top of bank of
any watercourse.
(b) When available, information from other federal, state, and
other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the BFE,
as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the BFE shall be determined by using
a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which
is nearest the construction site in question.
(3) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Borough of
Middletown.
D. Supplemental floodplain area (SA).

1:192
§ 158-20. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough
Council, with recommendations by the Planning Commission and Borough
Engineer, where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 158-21. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(2) Special requirements. No new construction or development shall
be located within the area measured 50 feet landward from the top
of bank of any watercourse.

construction. For coordination purposes, references to the above are made
specifically to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage
or repetitive loss regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local
code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions.
A.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement, as defined in this chapter, must
comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause
removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the
Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following terms shall have, for the
purpose of this article, the meanings indicated in this section:
OCCUPIER OF REAL ESTATE  Any person who owns, leases or has control
of or occupies real estate in the Borough of Middletown, Dauphin County,
Pennsylvania.
PERSON  Includes any natural person, firm, association, copartnership
or corporation.[Amended 3-13-1967 by Ord. No. 510, approved
3-13-1967]
RESIDENCE  Any private dwelling, store, apartment, theater,
manufacturing plant, garage and any other building not herein specifically
mentioned to which the Borough of Middletown supplies electric current
and in or on which an electric meter for the measuring of the electric

§ 164-10. Service charge levied. [Amended 12-3-1990 by Ord. No.
1011, approved 12-3-1990; 2-7-1994 by Ord. No. 1054, approved
2-7-1994; 12-14-2010 by Ord. No. 1275, approved 12-14-2010;
12-17-2013 by Ord. No. 1301, approved 12-17-2013]
§ 164-11. Basis for determining applicability of charge. [Added
12-14-1981 by Ord. No. 806, approved 12-14-1981]
For administrative convenience, each dwelling unit may normally be
identified in terms of and correlated with the Borough records relating to
the electric meter applicable thereto. A "dwelling unit" for this purpose
(as under § 260-12 of Chapter 260, Zoning) may be defined as one or
more rooms used for living and sleeping purposes and having usually a
kitchen with fixed cooking facilities, arranged for occupancy by one family.
A. There is hereby levied, assessed and imposed a service charge for
Borough purposes on occupiers of real estate in the Borough of
Middletown for the collection and removal of garbage, ashes, refuse,
paper and other debris from premises situated in the Borough of
Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, with the rate as follows:
(1) Beginning January 1, 2011: $25.65 per month, or any part thereof.
B. All persons, except commercial users of electric current where no
garbage is collected, who are residents within the Borough of
Middletown shall be liable for said service charge. Occupiers of real
estate living in apartments shall severally be liable for said service
charge, each apartment being considered one unit of real estate, but no
one occupier of real estate shall pay more than one service charge.
§ 164-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 164-11
1:225
As applied over the years, therefore, one such service charge is levied
against, inter alia, each dwelling unit. In the few instances where billing in
terms of electric meters does not truly reflect and implement the purpose
of said garbage and refuse service charges, the Borough Manager is hereby
authorized to issue interpretive determinations. Any determination is to be
noted in writing and made a permanent part of the specific account.
§ 164-12. Charge added to electric bill. [Amended 3-13-1967 by
Ord. No. 510, approved 3-13-1967]

be paid when due, a penalty of 10% of the amount of the service charge due
and unpaid shall be added thereto and collected.

with these borderline cases, include the following:
(1) A separate meter for a dusk-to-dawn light.

The funding for the Homestead Loan Program is derived from residential,
rehabilitation loan repayments for loans previously granted through
federally funded projects. All monies accrued through loan repayments and/

been appointed pursuant to Resolution Number 240 of 1993, the
predecessor to this chapter, shall continue in said capacity for the balance
of their terms.
§ 168-5. Home improvement loans.
A. It shall be the goal of this type of loan to provide low-and moderateincome
property owners with low-interest-rate loans so that singlefamily
dwellings in the Borough may be brought into compliance with
building, electric, sewer, or other codes as defined by the Middletown
Code of Ordinances.
B. All loans shall be to low-and moderate-income persons (as determined
by the Section 8 income guidelines of the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development for the Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle
Pennsylvania MSA; or any successor housing program as administered
by the Dauphin County Housing Authority).
C. Loans to absentee landlords shall be governed by the requirement that
all tenants within the structure for which the loan is being applied must

eligibility, or where the proposed code or home improvements do not
meet with the goals of this chapter.
J. Loans shall not be made for construction activities that will convert a
single-family dwelling into a multifamily dwelling.

behalf of the loan recipients as submitted to the Borough Secretary.

information and shall be accompanied by such drawings of the
proposed work as may be required by the Code Enforcement Officer for

§ 179-1. Loitering or prowling prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or
in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that
warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
A. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight
upon appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or
herself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any
object.
B. As a procedural condition to conviction, if practicable and unless flight
by the actor or other circumstance makes it impracticable, a police
officer shall, prior to any arrest under this section, afford the actor an
opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted by
requesting said actor to identify himself or herself and explain his or
her presence and conduct. Also, no person shall be convicted of an
offense under this section if it appears at the hearing that the
explanation given by the actor was true and, if believed by the police
officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.
C. Types of loitering. No person shall loiter in a public place in such
manner as to: [Added 11-6-1990 by Ord. No. 991]
(1) Create or cause to be created a danger of a breach of the peace.
(2) Create or cause to be created any annoyance to any person or
persons.
(3) Obstruct the free passage of pedestrians or vehicles.

§ 179-1.1. Definitions. [Added 11-6-1990 by Ord. No. 991]
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:
LOITERING  Remaining idle essentially in one location; lingering or
spending time idly; loafing or walking about aimlessly in one vicinity or
neighborhood; or "hanging around" for no legitimate purpose other than to
linger in the area.
PUBLIC PLACE  Any place to which the public has access, including any
public street or public sidewalk or the front of and the area immediately
adjacent to any school, parking lot, store, restaurant, tavern or other place
of business.
§ 179-2. Lingering in or about specific facilities. [Amended
8-8-1983 by Ord. No. 862, approved 8-8-1983]
Under circumstances falling short of rendering such person an implied
invitee or licensee, it shall be unlawful for any person to linger in or about
and for a purpose unconnected with lawful activity related to facilities of
a restricted public nature to which the public or a substantial group has
access, including a store, shopping center, school, railroad stop or station,
the post office, the Borough's municipal or community building or any
place of public worship or any parking area serving any such facility or
any residential, municipal or commercial parking area to which the public
or a substantial group has access. Such specific places shall be deemed
to include, to the fullest extent permitted as reasonable under all the
circumstances, any point within 100 feet of such place or facility for the
effective dispelling of alarm for safety of persons or property, prevention of
disruption of activities in which such facilities specialize and minimizing of
trespassing or trespassing ab initio.
§ 179-3. Group loitering. [Amended 8-8-1983 by Ord. No. 862,
approved 8-8-1983]
On any public street or parking area of any type adjacent thereto open as
a parking area or street to the use of the public, irrespective of whether
such public use is a matter of right, and including streets as well as parking
lots open to public use as a privilege by permission of the owner, including
sidewalks thereof (and walls, steps or points immediately adjacent thereto
so as to minimize evasion), it shall be unlawful for three or more persons as
a group or as interacting individuals or groups to linger for more than 10
minutes under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons
or property in the vicinity.
(4) Obstruct, molest or interfere with any person lawfully in any public
place, as defined in § 179-1.1 of this chapter. This shall include the
making of unsolicited remarks of an offensive, disgusting or
insulting nature or which are calculated to annoy or disturb the
person to whom, or in whose hearing, they are made.

1:249
§ 179-4. Requests by police officers to leave. [Amended 11-6-1990
by Ord. No. 991]
Whenever the presence of any person in any public place is causing or is
likely to cause any of the conditions enumerated in § 179-1C of this chapter,
any police officer may order that person to leave that place. Any person who
is observed by a police officer standing around in violation of this chapter
for a period of 10 minutes or more shall be guilty of a violation of this
section.
§ 179-5. Violations and penalties. [Amended 11-6-1990 by Ord. No.
991]
Any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter shall, upon
conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $300 and/or
imprisonment for a term not to exceed 90 days.
§ 179-6. Construction and interpretation.
A. A police officer, acting reasonably and objectively, may warn such
persons to disperse.
B. If reasonably necessary to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be
warranted, a police officer may clear the area of such persons, causing
those who refuse or fail to leave to be taken to the police station. At the
police station, the Sergeant on duty shall ascertain relevant facts,
under constitutional safeguards, and assume centralized responsibility
for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement. Such
persons may thereupon be permitted to return or be escorted to their
respective homes if such action is consonant with dispelled alarm for
the safety of persons or property in the area affected. Said Sergeant
shall promptly, within 24 hours, file a written report with the Chief.
C. As a last resort for effective crowd control, after consultation with the
Mayor, proceedings may be instituted before the District Justice under
this section.
A. Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions, parts,
phrases and terms of §§ 179-1, 179-2 and 179-3 and the application
thereof; if any of such are held invalid, this shall have no effect in any
other respect, and the invalidity of any minimum number shall have no
effect on the applicability of the minimum number constitutionally
permissible or any higher number.
B. A constitutional construction is likewise intended in every respect, and,
from excess of caution, exercise of First Amendment rights is hereby
specifically excepted from the provisions of § 179-1, 179-2 or 179-3.
C. To be as fair and specific as possible, the Mayor is authorized to give
advisory opinions, in writing or immediately reduced to writing, which
shall be binding and shall be adhered to by the police, until an

A fine not to exceed $1,000, plus costs of prosecution, and, upon refusal
to pay such fine and costs, imprisonment in the Dauphin County Jail for
a period not exceeding 30 days shall be the sentence, upon conviction
thereof, for any person who shall, in violation of this article, unreasonably
make, continue or continue or cause to be made or continued any noise
disturbance hereby prohibited, annoying or disturbing a reasonable person
of normal sensitivities.
A. Hereby prohibited is operating, playing or permitting the operation or
playing of any radio, television set, phonograph or similar device which
produces, reproduces or amplifies sound in such a manner as to create
a noise disturbance (any sound which annoys or disturbs a reasonable
person of normal sensitivities) across a real property boundary. A real
property boundary means an imaginary line along the ground surface
and its vertical extension, which separates the real property owned by
one person from that owned by another person, but not including
intrabuilding real property divisions.
B. Also prohibited is owning, possessing or harboring any dog or animal
which howls, barks, meows or makes other sounds frequently or for
continuous duration which create a noise disturbance. To the end that
no person in Middletown shall be deprived of or suffer unreasonable
interference with peace, quiet, rest or sleep, this prohibition shall apply
broadly, as in the July 1977 City of Harrisburg Ordinance No. 15, to any
owner, any person having a right of property in such animal, any person
who keeps or harbors such animal or has it in such person's care or any
person who permits such animal to remain on or about any premises
occupied by such person. Any person who violates this Subsection B
shall be given notice thereof, either in writing or orally, by the Borough
police. Any person who violates this Subsection B after receiving one
warning shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced as hereinbefore
provided in the first sentence of § 185-1. [Added 9-12-1977 by Ord.

All provisions and terms and any application thereof are severable. No
application of this section to ambulance, fire or police vehicles, however, is
intended.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a vehicle on any public
street or private property in the Borough of Middletown in such a
manner as to make any unnecessary sound which annoys, disturbs or
perturbs reasonable persons with normal sensitivities or reasonably
may be perceived to injure or endanger the comfort, repose, health,
peace or safety of any person, whether by racing the motor, spinning
the wheels or other means lacking redeeming social utility.
B. Such operation includes operation of any part of a vehicle, such as its
motor, irrespective of the extent, if any, to which the entire vehicle is in
motion. It may be standing or parked.
C. A fine not to exceed $1,000 plus costs of prosecution, and, upon refusal
to pay fine and costs, imprisonment in the Dauphin County Jail for a
period not exceeding 30 days shall be the sentence, upon conviction
thereof, for any person who shall be in violation of this article.

A. In cases of urgent necessity, where public health and safety will not be
impaired and upon evaluation of the loss or inconvenience to any party
in interest, the Borough Manager may grant exceptions to the
provisions of § 185-4. Such exceptions may be granted by permit issued
by the Borough Manager upon written application and shall be valid for
a period not exceeding 30 days.

which any person violates any provision of this article shall constitute a
separate offense.

of bridges, streets, highways or utilities by or on behalf of the
Borough when the public welfare and convenience renders it
impossible to perform such work during permitted hours.

in the pollution of said waters; nor to dump, deposit or leave any
bottles, broken glass, paper, boxes, cans, dirt, rubbish, waste, garbage,
refuse or trash anywhere within the park or conservancy sites owned by
the Borough; but rather to make use of proper receptacles where these
are provided, and where receptacles are not so provided, all such
materials shall be carried away from the park by the person responsible
for its presence and properly disposed of elsewhere.
A. Hours of operation.
(1) Recreation, park and conservation areas shall generally be open
daily to the public between dawn and dusk, with certain limited
exceptions.
(a) This shall not preclude free access to and egress from the
Swatara Creek at the Pennsylvania Fish Commission boat
launching ramp near the end of South Union Street in
connection with night fishing.
(b) Use of any lighted recreational areas, including the basketball
courts, tennis courts, and sand volleyball court at Hoffer Park

Arrangements for use of the lights must be made in advance by
special permit from the office of the Borough Manager.
(2) It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, other than Borough

purpose, a representative of said group, association or organization
shall first obtain a special permit for such use in specially designated
areas from the office of the Borough Manager.
(1) The Borough Manager may delegate his responsibilities under this
section to another appropriate Borough employee or the
Recreation Director of the Olmsted Regional Recreation Board (or
any successor organization).
(2) The Borough Council may adopt a building or park or conservation
area utilization form to be used by the Borough Manager or
designee.
C. The Borough Manager or designee shall grant the permit if it appears
that the group, association or organization will not interfere with the
general use of the park by members of the public, if the intended use is
consistent with the purposes of the building, park or conservation area
and implicit in their character, and if the group, association or
organization meets all other conditions contained in the application.
(1) In the event that application is made by a group, association or
organization for a use that is not consistent with the intended
purposes of the park, such as theatrical or entertainment
performances, then the Borough Manager or designee shall seek
the approval of Borough Council for such special permit.
(2) In the case of any special permit or request for use, the Borough
may require an indemnity bond or other security to protect the
Borough from any liability of any kind or character and to protect
Borough property from damage.
D. Use of facilities. Facilities and areas in Borough recreation, park or
conservancy sites shall be used only for the purposes designated or

scooters, motorcycles, minibikes, go-carts, snowmobiles and similar
vehicles, shall be permitted only at locations or trails specifically
designated for such use and at times established. No golf shall be
played on any Borough property, in any Borough parkland or
conservation area, irrespective of the type of balls used.

1:261
§ 195-4. Prohibited activities.
vehicles shall be parked in areas or places so provided and designated.
Parking in places contrary to posted regulations and times is
prohibited, and such vehicles may be removed by the Borough at the
owner's expense. All vehicles must exit the park area at the regular
closing time or within 15 minutes after the lights have been turned
off if the driver is attending an event at Hoffer or Oak Hill Parks as
set forth in Subsection A(1)(b), whichever is later. It shall be unlawful
to clean, wash, repair or do any work whatsoever on private vehicles
within recreation, park and conservation areas, except for emergency
repairs.
F. Fees. The Borough Manager or designee shall have the authority to

amount of deposits and prescribe conditions under which deposits are
collected or forfeited. Such revenue shall be used for recreation, park
and conservation purposes within the general fund.
A. Fires and fireworks. Fires may not be built or allowed anywhere in
recreation, park or conservation areas except in stoves, fireplaces or

be unlawful to bring any dangerous animal into any recreation, park or
conservation area.
C. Gambling. Gambling is prohibited in recreation, park or conservation
lands.
D. Merchandising, advertising and signs. Municipal recreation facilities
are public areas where the benefit of use includes the right to enjoy the
environment without the intrusion of commercial enterprise. Therefore,
to preserve and protect the aesthetics of recreation spaces, the
Borough Council herein prohibits most types of commercial enterprise,
solicitation, fund-raising activity, and advertisement. The only exception
to such prohibition is a narrow exception, which would allow certain
recreation facilities owned by the Borough of Middletown to recover
part of the maintenance expense of operating such facilities through
the assignment of the opportunity to seek sponsorships. [Amended
4-5-1993 by Ord. No. 1038, approved 4-5-1993; 5-7-2007 by Ord.

any such article or thing, except for special community events,
such as the Colonial Arts and Crafts Festival, Civil War
Reenactment Festival, or like events, as designated under the

resolution. The Main Pavilion in Hoffer Park may not be used

any article or service for sale or hire.
(c) Post, paste, fasten, paint, write, draw, carve, tack or affix any
placard, bill, notice, sign, advertisement or any inscription
whatever upon any structure, tree, stone, fence, thing or

on any public lands or highways or roads adjacent to any
recreation, park or conservation area, including but not limited
to all parks and fields, the Middletown Centre Square, and
Middletown's James and Edith Booser Reservoir, except that
the Borough Highway/Property Department may have
informational signs placed within such areas.
(2) Sponsorship. The Borough Council herein authorizes a local
nonprofit recreation agency to underwrite the cost of maintenance
of two specific facilities located in the Borough, through the sale of
sponsorship opportunities to support an event, activity, person, or
organization financially or through the provision of products or
services. The two specific facilities and the requirements are:
(a) Oak Hills ball field. The Middletown Amateur Baseball
Association (MABA), or its successor, may, for the purpose of
underwriting the cost of its community operation, affix
temporary canvas or plywood sponsorship signs upon the chain
link outfield fence and across the chain link backstop. The
sponsorship signs may state the names, logos, and contact
information of those persons, entities, corporations or firms
which have provided financial support for MABA. These
temporary postings must be removed at the end of each youth
baseball season and must be in a style and aesthetic that does
not interfere with the enjoyment of the baseball facility. The
Middletown Borough Council herein authorizes the MABA to
use its reasonable judgment in soliciting commercial support.
The MABA must transmit to the Borough Manager, by
correspondence prior to the opening day of each baseball
season, the name of each entity that will appear upon the
temporary signage.
(b) Community swimming pool. The Olmsted Regional Recreation
Board (Rec. Board), or its successor, may, for the purpose of
underwriting the cost of its community operation, affix
temporary canvas or plywood sponsorship signs upon the chain
link eastern fence only. The sponsorship signs may state the
§ 195-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-4
1:263
§ 195-5. Enforcement authority.
The Borough Manager or other agents designated by the Borough Council,
including the Recreation Director, shall administer the provisions of this
chapter, including the establishment and collection of fees, the preparation
of application forms, the issuance and revocation of permits, the
promulgation of rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this
chapter and all other decisions relative thereto. When acts or conduct of
individuals or groups is determined to be in violation of this chapter or
names, logos, and contact information of those persons,
entities, corporations or firms which have provided financial
support for the public pool or the Rec. Board. These temporary
postings must be removed at the end of each pool season and
must be in a style and aesthetic that does not interfere with
the enjoyment of the pool facility. The Middletown Borough
Council herein authorizes the Rec. Board to use its reasonable
judgment in soliciting commercial support. The Rec. Board
must transmit to the Borough Manager, by correspondence
prior to the opening of the pool each season, the name of each
entity that will appear upon the temporary signage.
(3) The Borough Manager, or his designee, is herein authorized to
remove any sponsorship sign not identified by the MABA or the
Rec. Board as a sponsor or any sign that is in violation with the
requirements established herein.
E. Aircraft. It shall be unlawful to land a private or commercial airplane or
helicopter on recreation, park or conservation lands.

person of any park, recreation or conservation lands, building or
facilities so long as such use is in compliance with this chapter and
the rules applicable to such use.
(7) Act in an unlawful, disorderly or disruptive manner or against the
best interests of the areas or other people.
(8) Ride a bicycle on the infield of a ball diamond.
§ 195-4 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 195-5

rules and regulations promulgated by the authority of this chapter or not
to be in the best interest of the recreation, park and conservancy area or
when such acts or conduct endangers other people or private or public
property or when such acts are deemed to be disruptive to the surrounding
neighborhood, the Borough police, the Recreation Director or their agents
assigned to such areas or programs shall have the authority to cause such
acts to be terminated or to expel the perpetrators of such acts from the
area or to call the Borough police to arrest and detain such individual or
individuals or to file a complaint for the violation of this chapter with a
District Justice.
§ 195-6. Violations and penalties. [Amended 7-11-1988 by Ord. No.
972, approved 7-11-1988]

conviction thereof before the District Justice, be sentenced to pay a fine
not to exceed $1,000 and not less than $25, plus costs, and, upon refusal
to pay the same, to be imprisoned in the Dauphin County Jail for a period

shall be increased an additional $25, making such minimum fine $50 for
the second offense, $75 for the third offense and so on, but in no event to
exceed $1,000, the statutory maximum. Where such violator has removed,
destroyed, damaged, defaced or befouled the recreation, park or
conservation area or the contents thereof, the cost of maintenance, repair
or replacement shall be charged to such person or group in addition to any
fines levied. Further use of recreation and park facilities may be denied to
violators of this chapter in addition to the imposition of fines and/or costs.

property. The cost for installing the new connection lines shall be
allocated amongst each property owner in proportion to the length of
the sewer lateral that serves each separate structure.
C. All sewer laterals shall be inspected upon the sale or transfer of any
property within the Borough. It shall be the duty of all parties to the
transfer to insure the proper inspection of the sanitary sewer system.

engineering and legal fees, if any, and costs of printing and advertising, and
shall equitably assess the costs against each and every property abutting
the line of the improvement, making allowances for corner lots and lots of
irregular shape where the assessment for the full frontage would be unjust.

380, approved 5-11-1959; amended 7-13-1964 by Ord. No. 471,
approved 7-13-1964]
A. Determination of sewer rents.
(1) The sewer rent for collection and treatment of sanitary sewage
discharged into the sewer system by all dwellings and
establishments, with the exception of government-owned facilities
for which a separate contract will be negotiated, will be based upon
the amount of water consumed as determined from meter readings
of the Middletown Water Department and shall be computed
pursuant to Subsection B below.
§ 226-13.1 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 226-14.1
1:312
(2) In cases where dwellings and establishments using the sewer
system have sources of water supply other than or in combination
with water supplied by the Middletown Water Department, the
measured flow shall be used as the basis for the computation of the
sewer rent pursuant to Subsection B below.
(3) In case two or more dwellings, flats, apartments, stores or offices
or two or more families in one dwelling unit have the use of the
sewer system through one sewer lateral, each and every dwelling,
flat, apartment, store or office shall be charged the minimum
charge, the same as if each such unit or family has a direct and
separate connection to the sewer system. The charge in excess of
such minimum shall be determined by dividing the total water
consumed, as shown by the meter readings, by the number of units
or families using a single sewer connection and applying the rate
schedules set forth in Subsection B below to the quantity so
determined.
B. Computation and time of payment of sewer rent and penalties. [Last
amended 8-18-2014 by Ord. No. 1303, approved 8-18-2014]
(1) The sewer rent imposed under Subsection A above shall be on a
monthly basis for all users. All billings shall be in arrears.
(2) The sewer rentals, rates and charges imposed under Subsection A
above shall be computed as follows:
Sewer Service Rate Schedule
Customer charge: $15 per month, increasing to $16 in 2015 and
$17.20 in 2016
Uniform volumetric charge: $1.515 per 100 gallons per month,
increasing to $1.540 in 2015 and $1.550 in 2016
(3) A penalty of 10% will be charged on all bills for sewerage service,
except bills covering services rendered to the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or any department or institution thereof or to
municipalities or school districts, if not paid by the due date. In the
case of bills rendered to the commonwealth or any department or
institution thereof or to municipalities or school districts, a period
of 30 days shall be allowed during which the bills are payable
without the penalty of 10%. If the bill is not paid within five days
after the 10% penalty has been invoked hereunder, the Borough,
upon five additional days' notice, in writing, to the consumer, may
shut off the water service until all moneys to the Borough for
sewerage service have been paid. In the interpretation of this rule,
payment by mail will be accepted with a discount or at face,
provided that it bears a postmark date within the period
prescribed.
(4) Users must give the Borough their correct address. Failure to
receive bills will not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor
§ 226-14.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 226-14.1
1:313
permit an extension of the period during which bills are payable
with a discount or at face.
(5) Lower Swatara Township.
(a) The Borough, the Borough Authority, Lower Swatara Township
and the Municipal Authority of Lower Swatara Township have
entered into an agreement with a twenty-five-year term that
requires the Borough and Borough Authority to provide
sanitary sewer service to a portion of Lower Swatara
Township, and further, Lower Swatara Township and the
Municipal Authority of Lower Swatara Township agree to
participate with the Borough and Borough Authority in the cost
of assembly, renovation, maintenance and operation of that
portion of the sanitary sewer collection system that benefits
Lower Swatara as well as a proportionate part of the publicly
owned treatment works.
(b) Pursuant to the intermunicipal agreement between the parties,
a portion of the capacity of the publicly owned treatment works
shall be placed in reserve for use by Lower Swatara Township.
(c) Pursuant to the intermunicipal agreement between the parties,
Lower Swatara Township shall be billed for wastewater
treatment.
(6) Royalton Borough.
(a) The Borough, the Borough Authority, Royalton Borough and
the Royalton Borough Authority have entered into an
agreement that requires the Borough and Borough Authority to
provide sanitary sewer service to Royalton Borough, and
further, Royalton Borough and the Royalton Borough Authority
agree to participate with the Borough and Borough Authority
in the cost of assembly, renovation, maintenance and operation
of that portion of the sanitary sewer collection system that
benefits Royalton as well as a proportionate part of the publicly
owned treatment works.
(b) Pursuant to the intermunicipal agreement between the parties,
a portion of the capacity of the publicly owned treatment works
shall be placed in reserve for use by Royalton Borough.
(c) Pursuant to the intermunicipal agreement between the parties,
Royalton Borough shall be billed for wastewater treatment.
C. Delinquent sewer rents and liens. All sewer rents, together with all
penalties thereon, not paid on or before the end of one year from the
date on which such bill was rendered shall be deemed to be delinquent.
All delinquent sewer rentals and all penalties thereon shall be a lien on
the property served and shall be entered as a lien against such property
in the office of the Prothonotary of Dauphin County and shall be
§ 226-14.1 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 226-14.1
1:314
collected in the manner provided by law for the filing and collection of
such liens.
D. The Borough's sewer rental charges are based upon metered water
consumption regardless of whether the water is used, wasted, or lost by
leakage or poor plumbing maintenance. In cases where Borough
officials can determine through an investigation that: water which
passed through a water meter was subsequently lost by a leak in the
building plumbing system, that the leak could not have been reasonably
known to the property owner or occupant, no portion of the water lost
by the leak entered into the Borough's sanitary sewer system; and the
applicant for the refund can prove that the leak has been repaired in
accordance with Borough Codes, then the Finance Director is
authorized to issue a credit on the customer account, in an amount
determined as reasonable in the sole judgment of the Finance Director.
The Finance Director is authorized to develop a written policy for the
method of investigation and determination of such leaks, as well as a
form to request credit. The credit shall be determined by the Finance
Director based upon an estimation of historic sewer rental. However, in
all cases, the period of adjustment shall not occur in more than two
billing periods, and adjustments of this type cannot occur for any
customer more than once in any twelve-month period. [Added
6-3-2008 by Ord. No. 1236, approved 6-3-2008]
E. In such cases where the applicant for the refund can provide acceptable
assurances that water which passed through a water meter was used
for a swimming pool or spa, that such water use was in excess of 500
gallons in one billing period, and that no portion of the water used
entered into the Borough's sanitary sewer system, then the Finance
Director is authorized to issue a credit on the customer account in an
amount determined as reasonable in the sole judgment of the Finance
Director. The Finance Director is authorized to develop a written policy
for the method of investigation and determination of such use, as well
as a form to request credit. [Added 6-3-2008 by Ord. No. 1236,

permit more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
wastewater treatment system if deemed necessary and appropriate to
comply with the objectives presented in § 226-15 of this article.
§ 226-26. Unlawful substitutes for treatment prohibited.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards or with any other pollutantspecific
limitation developed by the Borough, state or federal agencies.
§ 226-27. Accidental discharges.
such fines and costs, to a term of imprisonment for a term not
exceeding 30 days. Each day that the user contributes any of the
above-enumerated substances shall constitute a separate offense for
the purposes of this section.
A. Protection. Each user shall provide protection from accidental
discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own
cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Borough
for review and shall be approved by the Borough before construction of
the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan when
designated by the Borough. No user who commences contribution to
the POTW after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until the accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the Borough. Review and approval
of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from
the responsibility to modify its facility, as necessary, to meet the
requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is
the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the
POTW of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the
discharge, the type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective
actions.
B. Written report. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the
user shall submit to the Borough a detailed written report describing
the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to

request by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation or
reissuance or termination or a notification of planned changes or
anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition.
I. Permit transfer. Significant industrial user wastewater discharge
permits are issued to a specific significant industrial user for a specific
operation. A significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit
shall not be reassigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, new
significant industrial user, different premises or a new or changed
operation without the written approval of the Borough.
(1) The permittee must give at least 30 days' advance notice to the
Borough.

(6) Failure to pay sewer charges.
(7) Failure to meet compliance schedules.
K. Permit reissuance. The permittee shall apply for permit reissuance a
minimum of 180 days prior the expiration of the significant industrial
user's existing significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit.
If the significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit is not
reissued by the Borough prior to its expiration date, the conditions of
the existing permit shall continue until such time that a new permit is
issued by the Borough, though not to exceed three months.
L. Reporting requirements.
(1) Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case
of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any significant industrial user subject to
pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Borough a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are
limited by pretreatment standards or requirements and the
average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the
significant industrial user facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards and requirements. The report shall state
whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements
are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O &
M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the significant
industrial user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the significant industrial user and
certified to by a qualified professional.
(2) Periodic compliance reports.
(a) Any significant industrial user subject to a categorical standard
after the compliance date of such categorical standard or, in
the case of a new source, after commencement of the
discharge to the POTW, shall submit to the Superintendent,
during the months of June and December, unless required
more frequently in the categorical standard or by the
Superintendent, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by
such categorical standards. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting
period, exceeded the average daily flow allowed in the permit.
If sampling by the significant industrial user indicates a
violation, the significant industrial user shall notify the POTW
§ 226-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 226-32
1:341
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
significant industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
POTW within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation,
except if the POTW performs sampling at least once per month
at the significant industrial user's facility or if the POTW
performs sampling at the significant industrial user's facility
between the time when the significant industrial user performs
its initial sampling and the time the significant industrial user
receives the results of this sampling. At the discretion of the
Superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local
high and low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the
Superintendent may agree to alter the months during which
the above reports are to be submitted. This report shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the significant
industrial user.
(b) The Borough may impose mass limitations on significant
industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases
where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In
such cases, the report required by Subsection L(2)(a) of this
section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by
pretreatment standards in the effluent of the significant
industrial user. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and
the nature and concentration or production and mass where re
quested by the Borough, of pollutants contained therein which
are limited by the applicable pretreatment, standards. The
frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed in the
applicable pretreatment standard or by the Borough. All
analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or with
any other test procedures approved by EPA. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques approved by
EPA. (Comment: Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a
sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and
Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or
with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved
by EPA.)
M. Monitoring facilities. The Borough shall require to be provided and
operated at the significant industrial user's own expense monitoring
facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of
building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring
facility should normally be situated on the significant industrial user's
premises, but the Borough may, when such a location would be
§ 226-32 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 226-32
1:342
§ 226-33. Pretreatment.
impractical or cause undue hardship on the significant industrial user,
allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area
and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole
or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility and sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at
the expense of the significant industrial user. Whether constructed
on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities
shall be provided in accordance with the Borough's requirements and
all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written
notification by the Borough.
N. Inspection and sampling. The Borough shall inspect the facilities of a
significant industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this
article is being met and all requirements are being complied with.
Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the Borough or its representative ready access
during all working hours to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the
performance of any of their duties. The Borough, state and EPA shall
have the right to set up on the significant industrial user's property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a significant
industrial user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the
significant industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its
security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the Borough, state and EPA will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
A. Significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve
compliance with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within
the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment
regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the Borough shall be provided, operated and maintained
at the significant industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the Borough for review and shall be acceptable to the Borough before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the significant industrial user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the Borough under the provisions of this article.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
§ 226-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 226-33
1:343
operation shall be reported to and be accepted by the Borough prior to
the significant industrial user's initiation of the changes.
B. The Borough shall annually publish in the largest newspaper of general
circulation a list of the significant industrial users which were in
significant noncompliance (SNC) with applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements at least once during the previous 12 months.
The notification also shall summarize any enforcement actions taken by
the Borough against the significant industrial users during the same 12
months.
(1) For the purposes of this provision, a significant industrial user is in
SNC if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
(a) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here
as those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements
taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the
daily maximum limit or the average monthly limit for the same
pollutant.
(b) Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which 33% or more of all of the measurements for
each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period
equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the
average monthly limit multiplied by the applicable TRC. (TRC
equals 1.4 for BOD, O&G and TSS and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH.)
(c) Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily
maximum or longer-term average) that the Borough
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass-through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public).
(d) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused an imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment
or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency
authority under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B) to halt or prevent
such a discharge.
(e) Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance milestone contained in the significant industrial
user wastewater discharge permit or separate enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction or
attaining final compliance.
(f) Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required
reports, such as baseline monitoring reports, semiannual and
annual compliance reports, monthly monitoring reports and
reports on compliance with compliance schedules.

(g) Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
(h) Any other violation or group of violations which the Borough
determines will adversely affect the operation or
implementation of the Borough's pretreatment program.
(2) All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards
shall be made available to officials of the state or EPA upon request.
A. Information and data on a significant industrial user obtained from
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring
programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the significant
industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Borough that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets of the significant industrial user.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret presses shall not be
made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this
article, the national pollution discharge elimination system (NPDES)
permit, state disposal permit and/or the pretreatment program;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for
use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information.
C. Information accepted by the Borough as confidential shall be
transmitted to any governmental agency immediately when requested,
but not to the general public unless a ten-day notification is given to the
significant industrial user by the Borough.
A. Administrative enforcement remedies.
(1) Notification of violation (NOV). Whenever the Borough finds that a
significant industrial user has violated or is violating this article,
the significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit or any
order, prohibition, limitation or requirement contained herein, the
Borough may serve upon such person a written notice stating the
nature of the violation. Within 10 days of the receipt date of this
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted to the Borough by the
significant industrial user. If the significant industrial user fails to
§ 226-33 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 226-35
1:345
submit a plan within this ten-day period, the Borough shall develop
and enforce a plan to correct the violation in question at the
significant industrial user's expense. The provisions of this section
shall not relieve the significant industrial user of any responsibility
under this article, statute, law, rule or regulation.
(2) Cease and desist orders. When the Borough finds that a significant
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, the
significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, the Borough may issue an order to cease and
desist all such violations and direct the significant industrial user in
noncompliance to:
(a) Comply forthwith; and
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
necessary to properly address a continuing or threatening
violation, including halting operations and terminating the
discharge.
(3) Compliance order. When the Borough finds that a significant
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, the
significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, the Borough may issue a compliance order to the
significant industrial user responsible for the discharge directing
that, following a specific time period, sewer service shall be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances have been installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders may also contain other requirements as might
be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment
technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices.
(4) Consent orders. The Borough is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with the significant
industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will
include specific action to be taken by the significant industrial user
to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by
the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as
compliance orders issued pursuant to Subsection A(3) above.
(5) Show cause orders.
(a) Notwithstanding the aforesaid enforcement provisions, the
Borough may order any significant industrial user who causes
or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to
show cause before the Borough why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the

hearing to be held by the Borough regarding the violation, the
reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed
§ 226-35 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 226-35
1:346
enforcement action and directing the significant industrial
user to show cause before the Borough why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the
hearing shall be served by certified or registered mail (return
receipt requested) at least 10 days before the hearing. Service
may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
(b) The Borough or other person designated by the Borough shall
conduct the hearing and be authorized as follows:
[1] To issue notices of hearings requesting the attendance and
testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in such hearings.
[2] To take the evidence.
[3] To transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with
recommendations to the Borough for action thereof.
(c) At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony shall be
under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any member of the public
or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges
thereof.
(d) After the Borough has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the significant industrial user responsible for the
discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the
sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been
installed and existing treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders
and directives deemed necessary and appropriate may be
issued by the Borough.
(6) Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this
article, any significant industrial user who is found to have failed to

lien against an individual significant industrial user's property.
Significant industrial users desiring to dispute such fines must file

being notified of the fine. Where the Borough believes a second
§ 226-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 226-35
1:347
request has merit, the Borough shall convene a hearing on the
matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the significant
industrial user.
(7) Emergency suspensions.
(a) The Borough may suspend wastewater treatment service and/
or the significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit
when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the
Borough, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, causes interference with the POTW or causes the
POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
(b) Any significant industrial user notified of a suspension of
wastewater treatment service and/or the significant industrial
user wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the discharge to the POTW. In the event of a failure
by the significant industrial user to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Borough shall take steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or its
receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The
Borough shall reinstate the significant industrial user
wastewater discharge permit upon proof of the elimination of
the noncomplying discharge by the significant industrial user
and payment of any damages, fines, penalties or costs
associated with the discharge.
(c) A significant industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in
part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed
written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any further
occurrence to the Borough within 15 days of the date of
occurrence.

significant changes in operations or wastewater
constituents and characteristics;
§ 226-35 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 226-35
1:348
[3] Refusal to permit reasonable access to the significant
industrial user's premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring, or sampling; or
[4] Violation of the conditions of the significant industrial user
wastewater discharge permit.
(b) Noncompliant significant industrial users will be notified of the
proposed termination of their significant industrial user
wastewater discharge permit and be offered an opportunity to
show cause under Subsection A(5) above why the proposed
action should not be taken.
B. Judicial remedies. If any significant industrial user or other person
discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the POTW
contrary to the provisions of this article, federal or state pretreatment
requirements or any order of the Borough, the Borough Solicitor may
commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the
Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. Some of these actions
include the following:
(1) Injunctive relief. Whenever a significant industrial user has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this article, the significant
industrial user wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, the Borough Solicitor may petition the court for the
issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both, (as may
be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the
part of the significant industrial user. The Borough shall have such
remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect other sewer
service charges.
(2) Civil penalties.
(a) Any significant industrial user who has violated or continues to
violate this article and the orders, rules, regulations and
permits issued hereunder shall be liable to the Borough for a
civil penalty of not more than $25,000, plus actual damages
incurred by the POTW per violation per day as the violation
continues. In addition to the above-described penalty and
damages, the Borough may recover reasonable attorney's fees,
court costs and other expenses associated with the
enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses.
(b) The Borough shall petition the court to impose, assess and
recover such sums. In determining the amount of liability, the
court shall take into account all relevant circumstances,
including but not limited to the extent of harm caused by the
violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit
gained through the significant industrial user's violation,
corrective actions by the significant industrial user, the
§ 226-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 226-35
1:349
compliance history of the significant industrial user and any
other factor as justice requires.
(3) Criminal prosecution. Any significant industrial user who willfully
or negligently violates any provision of this article, the significant
industrial user wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine not to exceed $25,000 per violation per day or
imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
(4) Falsifying information. Any significant industrial user who
knowingly makes any false statements, representations or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other
document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article
or significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit or who
falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $25,000 per
violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year, or
both.
C. Affirmative defenses.
(1) Treatment upsets.
(a) Any significant industrial user which experiences an upset in
operations that places it in a temporary state of
noncompliance, which is not the result of operational error,
improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment
facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or
improper operation, shall inform the Borough thereof
immediately upon becoming aware of the upset. Where such
information is given orally, a written report thereof shall be
filed by the significant industrial user within five days. The
report shall contain:
[1] A description of the upset, its causes and impact on the
discharger's compliance status.
[2] The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times of noncompliance, and if the noncompliance is
continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably
expected to be restored.
[3] All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of such an upset.
(b) A significant industrial user which complies with the
notification provisions of this section in a timely manner shall
have an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought
by the Borough for any noncompliance with this article, the
significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit or
§ 226-35 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 226-35
1:350
order issued hereunder by the significant industrial user,
which arises out of violations attributable to and alleged to
have occurred during the period documented and verified
upset.
(2) Treatment bypasses.
(a) A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the
following conditions are met:
[1] The bypass is unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage.
[2] There is no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the
use of auxiliary treatment or retention of the wastewater.
[3] The significant industrial user properly notifies the
Borough as described in this section.
(b) Significant industrial users must provide immediate notice to
the Borough upon discovery of an unanticipated bypass. If
necessary, the Borough may require the significant industrial
user to submit a written report explaining the cause, nature
and duration of the bypass and the steps being taken to
prevent its recurrence. A significant industrial user may allow
a bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the
treatment system. Significant industrial users anticipating a
bypass must submit notice to the Borough at least 10 days in
advance. The Borough may only approve the anticipated
bypass if the circumstances satisfy those set forth in this
section.

ARTICLE III
Tapping Fees
[Adopted 12-3-2001 by Ord. No. 1145, approved 12-3-2001]
§ 226-36. Purpose.
Middletown Borough Council has determined, based upon a study and
report prepared by its consulting engineer, that a substantial expenditure
must be made for capital additions and improvements to the sewer system
operated by Middletown Borough in order to provide service for future
users of the sewer system, and has further determined that the cost of
construction and financing of such capital additions and improvements
would create an unreasonable and inequitable economic burden upon the
Borough and the existing users of the sewer system. It is, therefore, deemed
to be in the public interest of the Borough, the existing users of the sewer
system, and future users, that all improved properties hereafter connected
to the sewer system pay a tapping fee designed and calculated to create
a capital reserve fund to provide the cost of construction and financing of
such capital additions and improvements. The purpose of this article is to
provide for the imposition and collection of such tapping fees.
§ 226-37. Definitions.
When used in this article, the following words, terms and phrases shall have
prescribed to them the meanings hereafter set forth:

form to be provided by the Borough and shall be obtained from the office of
the Code Enforcement Officer.
§ 226-39. Imposition of fees.
A. A tapping fee is hereby imposed against any improved property and
against the owner of such improved property whenever the owner

constituting a portion of the sewer system owned by the Authority and
leased to the Borough, for each EDU within, or the equivalent flow
generated by, regardless of whether the sewer mains or extensions
thereto are installed by the owner, developer or by this Borough. In the
case of residential uses having multiple units or uses therein, a
separate tapping fee shall be paid for each dwelling unit or apartment.
In all other types of uses, a separate tapping fee shall be paid for each

such improved property shall be required to pay the additional tapping
fees as determined from the actual flow records.
(1) In those cases where an improved property is already connected to
the sewer system, and where there is an expansion of, addition to
or a change in the use of such improved property which results in
an increase in the volume of sanitary sewage discharged from such
property, an additional tapping fee shall be paid for each additional
EDU or the equivalent flow generated by such expansion, addition
or change in use, based upon the additional estimated average
daily flow of sewage to be generated by or discharged from such
improved property. If, during any full quarterly billing period
during the first year after substantial occupancy, the average daily
flow exceeds said estimated average daily flow, the owner of such
improved property shall be required to pay the additional tapping
fees as determined from the actual flow records. In the case of
domestic uses and apartment or office uses, an additional tapping
fee shall be paid for each additional dwelling unit or apartment or
each office or suite of offices added as a result of an expansion of,
addition to, or a change in the use of such improved property.

article shall be segregated by accounting practices from other revenues of
the Borough received in connection with the operation of the sewer system
and shall be credited to a capital reserve account. Said revenues shall be
used for the purpose of construction and financing of such capital additions
and improvements to the sewer system as may be required from time to

1358, approved 3-5-2019]
(4) If the permittee opens pavement having a bituminous concrete
surface and the wearing course is less than five years old or several
openings have been made within a two-year period, the permittee
shall, in addition to the restoration conditions outlined in this
section, mill and overlay the roadway in accordance with the
following conditions: [Amended 3-5-2019 by Ord. No. 1358,
approved 3-5-2019]
(a) When a longitudinal opening longer than 100 linear feet has
been made in the pavement, the permittee shall mill and
overlay the lane in which the opening was made for the entire
length of roadway that was opened, in a manner authorized by
the Borough designee.
(b) When two or more transverse openings have been made in the
roadway within 100 linear feet of each other, the permittee
shall mill and overlay lanes in which the openings were made
for the entire length of roadway between the openings, in a

3-5-2019 by Ord. No. 1358, approved 3-5-2019.
§ 235-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-18
1:375
shall mill and overlay lanes in which the openings were made
for the entire length of roadway between the openings, in a
manner authorized by the Borough designee.
(5) Regardless of the age of the wearing course: [Amended 3-5-2019
by Ord. No. 1358, approved 3-5-2019]
(a) If more than 50 linear feet of longitudinal or transverse
openings, or both, are made in the roadway, the Borough
designee may require the permittee to mill and overlay lanes in
which the openings were made for the entire length of roadway
that was opened, if the Borough determines that the rideability
or structural integrity of the roadway has been impaired by the
openings.
(b) If four or more openings are made by the same permittee
within 100 linear feet of roadway, the Borough may require the
permittee to restore the entire disturbed roadway between the
openings by milling, planing or other authorized method and
overlaying the entire disturbed roadway.
(6) It shall be the duty of every person, firm or corporation causing an
opening or excavation to be made in or on a thoroughfare within
the Borough of Middletown to replace the removed surface of the
thoroughfare and any damaged surface adjacent to the removed
surface with the same materials and using the same design as was
in place before the opening or excavation unless the preexisting
design or materials violates the specifications of § 235-18, in which
case the specifications of § 235-18 shall apply. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Borough designee may, at his or her sole discretion,
require the permittee to replace the removed or damaged surface
of the thoroughfare with the same material as that adjoining the
opening or damaged surface. The replaced surface must be
maintained for a period of two years at the proper grade, without
ridges or depressions, and in as good of a condition as it was prior
to the opening or excavation. If, to meet the requirements of this
section, the replaced surface requires a base course or binder
course inconsistent with the requirements of this Article V, the
requirements of the replaced surface shall prevail and be followed
in lieu of the requirements of this Article V. [Amended 7-20-2015
by Ord. No. 1316, approved 7-20-2015; 3-5-2019 by Ord. No.
1358, approved 3-5-2019]

opening or excavation to be made in or on a thoroughfare within the
Borough of Middletown to restore any removed or damaged
appurtenances using the same materials and design as was in place
prior to the work unless the preexisting design or materials violate the
specifications of this Article V, in which case the specifications of this
Article V shall apply. Examples of such appurtenances include, but are
not limited to, the restoration of curbing, sidewalks, crosswalks, lights
or lampposts, benches, trees or other vegetation, tree wells, flower
beds or holders, drain pipes, inlets, and signs. [Added 7-20-2015 by
Ord. No. 1316, approved 7-20-2015]
F. Construction requirements. [Added 3-5-2019 by Ord. No. 1358,
approved 3-5-2019]
(1) Any person who shall excavate a Middletown Borough street shall
thoroughly and completely excavate and restore the excavation in
such manner as to prevent any settling thereafter, and shall restore
the surface to the same condition as it was before the excavation,
all in accordance with the specifications set forth in the attached
"construction requirements" which are incorporated herein by this
reference and which may be amended from time to time by
Borough resolution.122 If within two years after the restoration
defects shall appear therein, the applicant shall be liable for the
cost of repairing said defects and for any injury or damages
resulting therefrom. In the event of settlement creating a hazard to
traffic or public safety, said applicant shall cause the same to be
repaired within 24 hours after notice by the Borough to the
applicant; said notice need not be in writing. In the event of a
defect not constituting an immediate hazard, same shall be
repaired within one week after notice by the Borough.
(2) If the work in excavating, restoring or maintaining shall not be
promptly executed or shall be unskillfully, improperly or
incompletely done, Middletown may cause the same to be done in a
manner conforming to this article, and the expense thereof,
including overhead expense, plus 25% shall be charged to the
applicant. No permit shall be issued to any person in default of this
122. Editor's Note: Said attachments are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 235-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-18
1:377
section until that person pays the cost and penalties herein
provided. No permit shall be granted to any person who, at the time
of application, is not in full compliance with all provisions of this
article.
(3) Where pavement is to be disturbed, the excavation or opening shall
be made by a clean cut using a diamond wheel or similar tool or
instrument. Openings shall be sawcut back 12 inches from the limit
of the trench. Minimum sawcut opening shall be a nominal three
feet in width.
(4) Trenching shall not be permitted across the improved area of a
street unless specifically authorized by the permit. Trenching
across the improved area of a street may be authorized by the
permit where drilling, boring, and driving or tunneling is not
feasible because:
(a) The subsurface is solid rock.
(b) There are other facilities located longitudinally under the
improved area and their location precludes methods other than
trenching.
(c) Adjacent development in a congested area makes the
construction of a tunneling or boring shaft impracticable.
(5) To protect the pavement and shoulders of the existing street
surface, all equipment shall have rubber wheels or runners and
shall have rubber, wood, or similar protective pads between the
outriggers and the surface, unless otherwise authorized by permit.
In the event that non-rubber-equipped machinery is authorized for
use under the permit, the pavement and shoulders shall be
protected by use of matting, wood, or other suitable protective
material having a minimum thickness of four inches, unless the
permit requires the permittee to repave the full width of the street.
If the equipment damages the pavement or shoulders of the street,
the permittee shall restore the pavement or shoulders to their
former condition, at permittee's expense.
(6) All excavation restoration work shall be subject to inspection by the
Borough. Upon completion of the excavation work, the permittee
shall give written notice to the Borough. The Borough shall reserve
the right to inspect the work, and, when necessary, enforce
compliance with the conditions, restrictions, and regulations
prescribed by the permit and this article. Approval of the work by
the Borough or its inspector shall not constitute acknowledgment
or acceptance that the work was actually performed in accordance
with the permit or this article, nor shall such approval by the
Borough or its inspector act as a release of the permittee or waiver
by the Borough of its right to seek performance or restitution from
the permittee, as permitted under this article.
§ 235-18 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 235-18
1:378
(7) Construction for street restoration shall be in conformance with the
latest revisions of Publication 72, entitled "Roadway Construction
Standards," and Publication 408, entitled "Roadway
Specifications," published by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation. In the event that the aforementioned publications
do not apply, the construction shall be in accordance with
requirements set forth by the Borough Engineer.
(8) The Borough reserves the right to waive these requirements based
upon the recommendations of the Borough Engineer.
(9) When any edge of the trench is located within two feet of an
existing pavement joint, the remaining pavement between the edge
of trench and the joint shall be removed and replaced in the same
manner as the trench restoration, with the following specifications:
(a) Width of two feet plus widest dimension, for forty-eight-inch
facility and less.
(b) Width of 2.5 feet plus widest dimension, for forty-eight-inch
facility or greater.
(c) In all cases, facility to be centered in the trench.
(10) Generally, excavation shall be backfilled with a No. 2A coarse
aggregate to a height not to exceed one foot over the top of the
facility and compacted in not more than four-inch layers. Metallic
marking tape shall be installed to identify the facility. The opening
shall then be backfilled with No. 2A coarse aggregate and
compacted throughout its full width in accordance with industry
accepted vibrator compactions standards in layers not to exceed six
inches. Restoration shall be as follows:
(a) For openings that have existing reinforced concrete base
paving, backfilling shall be placed within 10 inches of the base
of the pavement. The opening shall then be enlarged one foot
on each side to a depth of 10 inches. An eight-inch layer of
High Early Strength Concrete, whose composition conforms to
the latest PennDOT specifications, shall be placed and
protected from traffic for a least 24 hours. Superpave HMA
wearing course, PG 64-22, 9.5 mm, and having a minimum
compacted depth of two inches, shall then be used to close the
excavation or opening. Tack coat shall be applied to all sides
and surfaces receiving bituminous paving. After application of
the wearing course, the edges of the opening shall be sealed
with PG 64-22 sealer or equivalent to a width of not less than
six inches.
(b) For openings in bituminous pavement, backfilling shall be
placed to the bottom elevation of the base course. The opening
shall then be enlarged to one foot on each side to the depth of
the base paving. Tack coat shall be applied to all sides and
§ 235-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-18
1:379
surfaces receiving bituminous paving. Superpave HMA base
course, PG 64-22, 25.0 mm, shall match existing base paving or
minimum five-inch compacted depth. Superpave HMA wearing
course, PG 64-22, 9.5 mm, shall be placed having a minimum
compacted depth of two inches. After application of the
wearing course, the edges of the opening shall be sealed with
PG 64-22 sealer or equivalent to a width of not less than six
inches.
(c) Backfilling of tunnels shall be done in a manner designated by
the Borough. The Borough may require that materials be
tested to determine conformance with the above.
G. Temporary restoration. [Added 3-5-2019 by Ord. No. 1358,
approved 3-5-2019]
(1) As soon as work is completed at the excavation site, the permittee
shall take immediate steps to temporarily restore the street
surface. Cold or hot (Superpave, or other materials approved by
Borough) asphalt mix shall be installed immediately after the work
is completed within the street excavation on a daily basis within

resurfacing on a paved street, an additional 12 inches on each side of the
opening shall be cut back in order to assure a neat and complete job.124

For the purposes of this article, when used in connection with sidewalks
or curbs, "repair" is defined as any maintenance or work done on or to a
sidewalk, or a portion thereof, that is less than the construction, removal,
or replacement of the sidewalk, or a portion thereof. It shall be unlawful
for any person, firm or corporation to make any opening or excavation in or
under any sidewalk, or to construct, remove or replace any sidewalk or curb
within the limits of the Borough of Middletown, unless and until a permit
for that purpose is acquired in accordance with this article. Any such work,
including minor sidewalk or curb repairs not requiring a permit, shall be
completed in accordance with this article and according to the following
specifications:
A. Specifications for new sidewalks.
(1) All new sidewalks shall be a width of four feet, unless the proposed
sidewalk abuts an existing sidewalk, in which case the new
sidewalk shall conform to the width of the abutting sidewalk. Any
variation in width must have approval of the Code Enforcement
Officer prior to construction. New sidewalks constructed on streets
of the Borough of Middletown shall be of one-course concrete
construction or brick, as per specifications on file in the Borough's

be scored, in general, in four-foot sections, and in no case shall
scored sections be more than six feet in length. A one-half-inch
expansion joint shall be provided at least once in every fifth section
length of sidewalk and shall be filled with approved joint filler. An
expansion joint shall be provided where the sidewalk meets a curb
and at such other places as may be directed by the Code
Enforcement Officer or other person designated by the Council.
(3) All backfilling under sidewalk forms shall be 2B stone or modified
stone. In excessively poor drainage areas, the Borough may require
a minimum of three inches stone base as directed by the Code
Enforcement Officer.

(2) When lawfully constructed existing sidewalks, or portions thereof,
are damaged or removed, the sidewalk shall be repaired, rebuilt or
replaced with the same material as was in place prior to the
damage or removal. Restoration described in the preceding
sentence shall replicate the exact design used prior to the sidewalk
being damaged or removed unless the preexisting design violates
the specifications of § 235-30A, in which case the new sidewalk
specifications of § 235-30A shall apply. The replaced surface must
be maintained for a period of two years at the proper grade,
without ridges or depressions, and in as good condition as it was
prior to the damage or removal.
(3) All water and gas connections on sidewalks shall be so placed as to
conform to the grade of the street.
(4) All openings in existing sidewalks for water and gas connections
shall be made only in a manner approved by the Code Enforcement
Officer. Except for sidewalks consisting of bricks or other disjointed
material, all such openings shall be created by a concrete saw cut.
When replacing concrete or other similar material lacking a natural
joint, new work shall be separated at all points along the outside
sides or circumference thereof from the existing concrete sidewalk
by expansion joints.
§ 235-30 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 235-30
1:388
(5) All water and gas curb boxes, utility poles, fire hydrants and traffic
signs shall be enclosed in expansion joints as detailed in the
construction specifications as approved by the Borough Council.
Water and gas curb box covers shall be free of concrete in order to
permit easy access during the winter months.
(6) All details of construction not mentioned in this article shall be in
accordance with approved construction specifications.
(7) It shall be the duty of every person, firm or corporation causing
damage and repair to, or the removal and replacement of, any
sidewalk within the Borough of Middletown to also restore any
appurtenances removed or damaged in connection with the
sidewalk using the same materials and design as the original
appurtenance unless the original design violates the current
specifications. Examples of such appurtenances include, but are
not limited to, the curbing, adjacent sidewalks, crosswalks, lights
or lampposts, benches, trees or other vegetation, tree wells, flower
beds or holders, drain pipes, inlets, and signs.
C. Specifications for new curbs.
(1) All new curbing along any streets of the Borough of Middletown
shall be of concrete construction. The concrete shall conform to the
requirements of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Form
408 Specifications and shall be Class AA [3,000 pounds per square
inch] portland cement concrete with air-entraining admixture.
Proper means of soil compaction and removing surplus water shall
be used to the satisfaction of the Code Enforcement Officer or other
person designated by the Council. All new curbing shall include
contraction joints constructed of three-fourths-inch premolded
expansion joint material on center at a maximum of 15.5 feet to a
minimum of 10 feet, except where actual field conditions dictate a
shorter on center, the minimum distance may be four feet, subject
to the approval of the Code Enforcement Officer.
(2) All cuts in the street for curb replacement, whether concrete or
asphalt, must be made with a saw. Jackhammer cuts are no longer

Middletown shall be a minimum of eight inches in thickness at the
bottom and six inches at the top and 18 inches in depth.
(4) The height above the gutter line shall be six inches, with a
minimum of four inches and a maximum of eight inches under
certain conditions of the gutter line, and such variations shall be
permitted only upon approval of the Code Enforcement Officer. The
top of the curbing shall be floated smooth with a wooden float. The
front or face of the curb shall have a smooth rubbed finish to the
§ 235-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-30
1:389
gutter line. The top of the curb shall slope toward the street with a
slope of 1/4 inch to the foot.
(5) Where present curbs are of stone, they may be reset if stone is
sound and dressed along the original dimension lines. No stone
may be used for new curbing or reset if condemned by the Code
Enforcement Officer.
(6) In case of private driveways crossing any sidewalk, the curb shall
be depressed across the driveway by providing a sloping section on
either side with a slope of six inches per foot. No ramp or filler in
the gutter will be permitted.
(7) It is the responsibility of the contractors to install a minimum of two
inches of 2B modified stone adjacent to the street side of the curb
prior to the Borough patching the street with asphalt or concrete,
as the case may be.
(8) The contractor shall allow two inches for asphalt patching by the
Borough. Since the Highway Department blacktops the street after
contractors replace the curbing, it is important that the area in the
street be of a straight cut. Also, the area must be filled with 2B
stone at least one inch from the top, and it must be tamped.
(9) At limits of new work, the existing curb will be cut in an approved
manner with a concrete saw, the entire curb will be removed within
the limits of the work, and expansion joints will be placed at the
limits of work. The driveway will be built with a flair on each side so
as to make the curb cut three feet as a maximum, and there shall be
no sharp dip, two inches per foot being the maximum.
(10) All details of construction not mentioned in this article shall be in
accordance with approved construction specifications.
D. Permits.
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to construct
or replace any sidewalk or curb within the limits of the Borough of
Middletown unless and until a permit therefor is secured from the
Borough Secretary for each separate undertaking, such permit and
the application therefor to be in the form prescribed by said
Secretary and to contain a statement that the applicant agrees to
the terms of this article. Permits herein required include, but are

1:390
§ 235-31. Downspout drainage.
In cases where downspout water from any building is so discharged that
it would be drained onto the sidewalk, new sidewalks shall be constructed
that a four-inch pipe must be placed under the sidewalk and through the
curb. This will outlet the water into the gutter. This shall apply also to
reconstruction of a sidewalk involving the same considerations of public
policy and tantamount to new construction.
§ 235-32. Line and grade.
The Borough will provide all line and grade. All sidewalks and curbing shall
be constructed, reconstructed and repaired and the grading therefor done
upon the line and grade obtained by the property owner from the Code
Enforcement Officer or his authorized representative and not otherwise.
Upon notice as provided in §§ 235-28 and 235-29 of this article, as the case
may be, such work of construction, reconstruction or repair shall be done
by the owner or owners of such property. It is the responsibility of the
contractor to notify the Code Enforcement Officer of any inspections needed
prior to or after completion of the forms before concrete is poured.
respect to the Public Works Supervisor and/or Code Enforcement
Officer.
(3) The application for the permit and every such permit shall specify a
time when said construction or replacement shall occur and the
place where said construction or replacement shall be made,
together with such further information as the Secretary may
require; and any additional surface to be disturbed and any
additional time required may be endorsed on the permit by said
Secretary, provided that emergency breaks or leaks may be
repaired and a permit therefor secured within 24 hours.
(4) Permit charges shall be $50 for the first 50 square feet of sidewalk
constructed or replaced plus $25 for each additional 50 square feet
constructed or replaced, or portion thereof. Permit charges shall be
$50 for the first 100 linear feet of curb constructed or replaced plus
$25 for each additional 100 linear feet constructed or replaced.
These fees shall be for a four-week period beginning with the date
of the commencement of the work. For any work exceeding this
four-week period, there shall be added a sum of $50 per week until
work on the undertaking has been satisfactorily completed.
(5) It shall be the duty of any person or persons, firms or corporations
to whom a permit is issued or by whom any sidewalk or curb is
constructed or replaced to provide and maintain proper and
adequate guards, barriers and lights to prevent accidents, and they
shall assume all risks and be liable for all damages by reason of the
openings and excavations and by reason of any failure to properly
fill the hole or trench and maintain the disturbed surface in a safe
condition.

of construction, reconstruction or repair of any sidewalks or curbing, visit
the site of such work to ascertain whether or not such work is being
done according to the requirements of the ordinances of the Borough of
Middletown, and he shall visit any such site for such purpose whenever
requested by the property owner. Within five days after the completion
of the work of construction, reconstruction or repair of any sidewalk or
curbing, it shall be the duty of the owner of the property where such work
was done to notify the Code Enforcement Officer of the fact so that he may
cause the same to be inspected to determine whether the grade thereof has
been observed and followed.
§ 235-34.2. Performance of work by owner.
Any property owner, upon his own initiative and without notice from any
Borough authority, may construct, reconstruct or repair a sidewalk or curb
in front of or alongside his property, provided that such owner shall first
make application to the Code Enforcement Officer and shall conform to
the requirements of this article and shall not violate any ordinance of the
Borough as to the line and grade and as to materials used and that he shall
notify the Code Enforcement Officer within five days after the completion of
the work.
§ 235-34.3. Performance of work by Borough.
Upon failure of any owner of property in the Borough of Middletown to

expense of said owner, either by employees of the Borough of Middletown
or by contract between the Borough of Middletown and paving and curbing

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 236-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of
Middletown Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 236-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater
and increased runoff flows and velocities, which overtaxes the carrying
capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increases the
cost to the public to manage stormwater.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
C. A program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation
of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural
infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare and the
protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the
commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
G. Illicit discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can
contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.
§ 236-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 236-3
1:403
§ 236-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 236-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
§ 236-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
stormwater impacts by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864,
Act 167, 32 P.S. § 680.1 et. seq., as amended (the Storm Water Management
Act); the Borough Code, Act of February 1, 1966 (1965 P.L. 1656, No.
581), as amended; and the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.127
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
B. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
C. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
D. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
E. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
F. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
G. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect and maintain existing
uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection
streams.
H. Prevent scouring and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
I. Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management best management practices that are
implemented in the municipality.
J. Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES
permit requirements.
K. Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to
address nonstormwater illicit discharges into the municipality's
separate storm sewer system.
§ 236-3 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 236-5
1:404
§ 236-5. Applicability.
§ 236-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 236-7. Severability.
In the event that any section or provision of this chapter is declared invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the
validity of any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 236-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
A. This chapter applies to any regulated earth disturbance activities
within the municipality, and all stormwater runoff entering into the
municipality's separate storm sewer system from lands within the
boundaries of the municipality.
B. Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management
controls are also regulated under existing state law and implementing
regulations. This chapter shall operate in coordination with those
parallel requirements; the requirements of this chapter shall be no less
restrictive in meeting the purposes of this chapter than state law.
A. Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve
the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or
ordinance. To the extent that this chapter imposes more rigorous
requirements for stormwater management, the specific requirements
contained in this chapter shall be followed.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any of the
municipality's requirements regarding stormwater matters which do
not conflict with the provisions of this chapter, such as local stormwater
management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection
system design and details, outlet structure design, etc.). Conflicting
provisions in other municipal ordinances or regulations shall be
construed to retain the requirements of this chapter addressing state
water quality requirements.

Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained under
state regulations.
(1)
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
(2)
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by the addition of pollutants, such as sediment, and
changes in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates
as a result of changes in land surface area from those activities.
Therefore, permanent discharges to surface waters must be
managed to protect the stream bank, streambed and structural
integrity of the waterway to prevent these impacts.

disturbance activities and must be met prior to commencement of regulated
earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
A. All regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
be designed, implemented, operated and maintained to meet the
purposes of this chapter through these two elements:
(1) Erosion and sediment control prevention during the earth
disturbance activities (e.g., during construction); and
(2) Water quality protection measures after completion of earth
disturbance activities (e.g., postconstruction), including operations
and maintenance.
B. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until the requirements of this chapter are met.
C. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth disturbance
activities shall be addressed as required by § 236-12.
D. Postconstruction water quality protection shall be addressed as
required by § 236-13. Operations and maintenance of permanent
stormwater BMPs shall be addressed as required by Article IV.
E. All best management practices (BMPs) used to meet the requirements
of this chapter shall conform to the state water quality requirements,
unless more stringent requirements are needed as determined by the
municipality.
F. Techniques described in Appendix A (Low Impact Development)130 of
this chapter are encouraged because they reduce the costs of
complying with the requirements of this chapter and the state water
quality requirements.
A. All regulated earth disturbance activities subject to permit
requirements by DEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
B. Work within natural drainage ways subject to permit by DEP under 25
Pa. Code Chapter 105.
C. Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or
adjacent to surface waters of the commonwealth, including wetlands,
subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
130. Editor's Note: Appendix A is included at the end of this chapter.

disturbance activities.
§ 236-13. Water quality requirements after completion of regulated
earth disturbance activities.
D. Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a state
highway right-of-way, or require access from a state highway, shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
E. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
105.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an erosion and
sediment control plan for construction activities.
B. DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under 25
Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
C. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92,131 a DEP NPDES
construction activities permit is required for regulated earth
disturbance activities.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the municipality. The
issuance of a NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage under the
statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the requirements of
Subsection A.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements after
construction is complete.
B. The BMPs must be designed, implemented and maintained to meet
state water quality requirements and any other more stringent
requirements as determined by the municipality.
C. To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated earth

131. Editor's Note: See now 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92A.
§ 236-11 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 236-13
1:412
BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that
postconstruction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(No. 392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions.
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater
runoff; and
(3) Stream bank protection: management of volume and rate of
postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent physical
degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
D. DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation and maintenance of best management practices
(BMPs) that control runoff from new development and redevelopment
after regulated earth disturbance activities are complete. These
requirements include the need to implement postconstruction
stormwater BMPs with assurance of long-term operations and
maintenance of those BMPs.
E. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to
the municipality. The issuance of a NPDES construction permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies
the requirements of Subsection A.
F. BMP operations and maintenance requirements are described in Article
IV of this chapter.

Plat Requirements and Processing Procedures
§ 238-4. Compliance required.
Whenever a subdivision or land development of land is desired to be
effected, a plat of the layout of such subdivision shall be prepared, filed and
processed according to the requirements of this chapter.
§ 238-4.1. County review.
Upon receipt by the Borough of the application and application fee, all
applications for subdivision or land development shall be forwarded to
the county Planning Commission for review and report, provided that the
Borough shall not act on such applications until the county report is
received or until the expiration of 30 days from the date the application was
forwarded to the county, whichever first occurs.
§ 238-4.2. Properties owned by trusts or equitable owners. [Added
5-3-2004 by Ord. No. 1176, approved 5-3-2004]
§ 238-5. Preapplication plans and data procedure.
A. Applications for subdivision or land development of lands or property
owned by or leased from a trust or an equitable owner shall include a
letter attached to the application from the trustee(s) or equitable
owner(s), or their authorized representative, stating the following:
(1) That the trustee(s) or equitable owner(s) are aware of the
application for subdivision or land development;
(2) That the trustee(s) or equitable owner(s) have reviewed the
application; and
(3) That the applicant(s) has authorization from the trustee(s) or
equitable owner(s) to file the application for such subdivision or
land development approval.
B. No applications for subdivision or land development of property owned
by or leased from a trust or an equitable owner shall be accepted by the
Borough without a letter pursuant to Subsection A above.
A. Prior to the preparation and filing of the preliminary plat, the applicant
shall submit to the Commission the following plans and data and shall
ascertain from the Commission those elements which should be
considered in the design of the subdivision. These shall include any
features of the Borough's plan of future land use, thoroughfare plan,
community facilities plan or of any plans of the Commission, including
but not limited to proposed streets, recreation areas, drainage
reservations, shopping centers and school sites.
§ 238-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-5
1:433
§ 238-6. Preapplication plans and data specifications.
Preapplication plans and data shall include the following:
B. At this stage, if the applicant's tract is located where a flood hazard
exists, the following regulations shall apply:
(1) The applicant shall prepare a contour map of the proposed area
with such contour intervals as the Engineer shall determine to be
necessary and shall prepare drainage plans or flood control devices
satisfactory to the Engineer whenever the Engineer shall consider
that such are necessary. No plat shall be approved until the
Engineer shall certify to the governing body that the proper plans
for drainage and flood control have been made. In the event that
the Engineer so certifies, he shall also present the governing body
with cost estimates for the construction of such facilities.
(2) Land subject to flooding. Land subject to flooding and deemed to be
topographically unsuitable shall not be platted for residential
occupancy nor for such other uses as may increase danger to
health, life or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazard. Such
land within the subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for such
uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional
inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
(3) Adequate building site. To ensure that residents will have sufficient
land upon which to build a house which is flood free, the
Commission may require elevations and flood profiles. Each lot
shall contain a building site which shall be completely free of the
danger of floodwaters.
(4) Street elevation. The Commission shall not recommend approval of
streets subject to inundation or flooding by water. All streets must
be adequately located above the line of flood elevation to prevent
isolation of areas by flood. Profiles and elevations of streets in areas
subject to flooding are required.
C. In response to a written request by the applicant, the Commission may
waive the requirement of preapplication plans and data, provided that
no new streets are involved and that fewer than six lots are proposed in
the total subdivision.

by the Commission, the modification and the reasons for its necessity
shall be entered in the records of the Commission.
F. When the plat is not approved in form as filed, the decision shall specify
the defects found in the application and describe the requirements
which have not been met and shall, in any case, cite the provisions of
this chapter.
G. Failure of the Borough Council to render a decision and communicate it
to the applicant within the prescribed time and in the manner described
herein shall be deemed an approval of the application in terms as
presented, unless the applicant has agreed, in writing, to an extension
of time or change in the prescribed manner of communication.
H. Before acting on any plat, the Borough Council may hold a public
hearing pursuant to public notice.
I. Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the
final plat by the governing body.
A. The preliminary plat shall be drawn on a copy of the topographic map
and shall show:
(1) The layout, names and widths of rights-of-way and cartways and
paving of proposed streets, alleys and easements.

(5) Applicants shall present evidence to the governing body or
planning agency, as the case may be, that the subdivision or
development is to be supplied with water by a certified public
utility, bona fide cooperative association of lot owners or by a
municipal corporation, authority or utility. A copy of a letter from
the municipal authority and the municipal electric department,
whichever is appropriate, shall be acceptable evidence.
(6) No plat which will require access to a highway under the
jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation shall
be finally approved unless the plat contains a notice that a highway
occupancy permit is required pursuant to Section 420 of the Act of
June 2, 1945 (P.L. 1242, No. 428), known as the "State Highway
Law,"134 before access to a state highway is permitted.

134. Editor's Note: See 36 P.S. § 670-101 et seq.
§ 238-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-9
1:437
A. Not later than five years after the date of approval of the preliminary
plat, the applicant shall file with the Commission a final plat. Failure to
comply with the time limitation herein provided shall make the approval
of the preliminary plat null and void, unless an extension of time is
requested by the applicant and, for good cause, granted by the
governing body.
B. The final plat shall incorporate all the changes and modifications
required by the Commission, otherwise it shall conform to the approved
preliminary plat and it may constitute only that portion of the approved
preliminary plat which the applicant proposes to record and develop at
the time, provided that such portion conforms to all of the requirements
of this chapter.
C. The final plat shall be drawn on a reproducible material on the
topographic map. Forty-five days prior to the meeting of the governing
body at which consideration is desired, the applicant shall file six copies
of the final plat with the Commission.
D. Upon receipt by the Borough, applications for subdivision or land
development shall be forwarded to the county Planning Commission for
review and report together with a fee sufficient to cover the costs of the
review and report which shall be by the applicant, provided that the
Borough shall not approve such application until the county report is
received or until the expiration of 30 days from the date the application
was forwarded to the county.
E. Before approval of a final plat, the Borough Council must be assured of
the completion of all improvements required by Article IV of this
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance or the Borough Council.
Also assurance must be received by the Borough that phased land
development not intended for the immediate erection of buildings
where streets, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire hydrants, water and
sewage facilities and other improvements which may not be possible to
install as a condition precedent to final approval of plats must be
completed prior to the erection of buildings on lands included in the
approved plat. Such assurance shall be by means of financial security
deposited with appropriate municipal officials in sufficient amount to
cover the costs of any improvements and be in the form of federally or
commonwealth-chartered-institution irrevocable letters of credit or
restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending institutions, or any other
type of financial security which the Borough Council may approve. Such
financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or federally
or commonwealth-chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided that such bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
commonwealth. Such financial security shall provide for improvements
which may be required within one year of the date fixed in the
subdivision plat for completion of such improvements.
§ 238-9 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 238-9
1:438
(1) The amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the cost
of the required improvements for which financial security is to be
posted. The cost of such improvements shall be established by
submitting to the Borough Council a bona fide bid or bids from the
contractor or contractors chosen by the party posting the financial
security to complete the improvements. In the absence of such
bona fide bids, the costs shall be established by an estimate
prepared by the Borough Engineer. The municipality, upon the
recommendation of the Municipal Engineer, may refuse to accept
such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or developer
and the municipality are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the
estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed in this commonwealth and chosen
mutually by the municipality and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be
paid equally by the municipality and the applicant or developer.
(2) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year to complete the required improvements, the amounts of
financial security may be increased by an additional 10% for each
one-year period beyond the first anniversary date of the posting of
the financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the
cost of completion of the required improvements as reestablished
on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period,
through the use of the above bidding procedure. Where
development is projected over a period of years, the Borough
Council may authorize submission of final plats by sections or
stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees
as to improvements in future sections or stages of development as
it finds essential for the protection of the development.
(3) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may, from time to time, request
the Borough Council to release or authorize the release of such
portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests
shall be in writing addressed to Borough Council. Borough Council
shall then have 45 days from receipt of such request in which the
Borough Engineer shall certify to Borough Council, in writing, that
such portion of the work upon the improvements has been
completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such
certification, Borough Council shall authorize release by the
bonding company or lending institution of an amount fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed, as
estimated by the Borough Engineer. If Borough Council fails to act
within the forty-five-day period, it shall be deemed to have
approved the release of funds as requested. Prior to final release at
the time of completion and certification by its Engineer, Borough
§ 238-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-9
1:439
Council may require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the
aforesaid improvements.
(4) Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, it may require the
posting of financial security for a term not to exceed 18 months
from the date of acceptance of dedication to secure the structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plat. Said financial security shall be of the
same type as otherwise required in this section with regard to
installation of such improvements, and the amount of such financial
security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of
said improvements.
(5) If sanitary sewer lines, along with apparatus or facilities related
thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and pursuant to
the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal authority
separate and distinct from the Borough of Middletown, financial
security to assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall
be posted in accordance with the regulations of the controlling
public utility or municipal authority and shall not be included
within the financial security as otherwise required by this section.
(6) If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a
plat as set forth in this section, the Borough shall not condition the
issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the
erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon
the lots or land as depicted on the final plat, upon actual
completion of the improvements depicted on the approved final
plat. If financial security has been provided, occupancy certificates
for any building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld
following the improvement of the streets providing access to and
from existing public roads to such building or buildings to a mudfree
or otherwise permanently passable condition, as well as the
completion of all other improvements as depicted on the approved
plat either on the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in question, if
such improvements are necessary for the reasonable use of or
occupancy of the building or buildings.
(7) When the developer has completed all of the required
improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough Council, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the
Borough Engineer.
(a) Within 10 days after receipt of such notice, the Borough
Council shall direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to
inspect all of the required improvements.
§ 238-9 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 238-9
1:440
(b) The Borough Engineer shall thereupon file a written report
with Borough Council and shall promptly mail a copy of the
same to the developer by certified or registered mail. Within 30
days after the Borough Engineer receives authorization for
inspection from Borough Council, the report shall be made and
mailed.
(c) The report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or
rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and
if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be
approved or shall be rejected by the Borough Engineer, said
report shall contain a statement of reasons for nonapproval or
rejection.
(d) The Borough Council shall notify the developer, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of its action with relation thereto.
(e) If the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all
improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the
developer shall be released of all liability pursuant to its
performance guaranty.
(f) If any portion of the improvement shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by Borough Council, the developer shall
proceed to complete the same, and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification as contained herein shall be followed.
F. Borough Council shall determine whether the final subdivision plat
shall be approved or disapproved and shall give notice to the applicant
in the following manner:
(1) Before Borough Council acts on any final subdivision plat the
Planning Commission shall review any final plat at its next
regularly scheduled meeting to occur not more than 30 days from
the date the application is filed. Upon review, the recommendations
of the Commission shall be forwarded to Borough Council for
further action, and, after notice to the public, the Borough Council
may hold a public hearing.
(2) The Borough Council shall determine whether the final plat shall be
approved or disapproved and shall notify the applicant, in writing,
not later than 15 days following the decision. If the final plat is
approved with conditions or disapproved, a statement of reasons
for such action shall be included with the notification to the
applicant.
(3) Borough Council shall act on any such final plat not later than 90
days following the date of the Planning Commission meeting which
referred the matter to Borough Council. In the event that any
alteration of requirements from this chapter is requested by the
applicant or is deemed necessary by the Commission for approval,
§ 238-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-9
1:441
the alteration and the reason for its necessity shall be entered in
the records of the Commission.
(4) When the application is not approved as filed, the decision shall
specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite
the provisions of this chapter.
(5) Failure of Borough Council to render a decision and communicate it
to the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein
shall be deemed an approval of the application in terms as
presented unless the applicant has agreed, in writing, to an
extension of time or change in the prescribed manner for
communication of the decision, in which case failure to meet the
extended time or change in manner of communication shall have
like effect.
(6) No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made on
any final plat of a subdivision after approval has been given by the
governing body and endorsed, in writing, on the plat unless the plat
is first resubmitted to the governing body. Before acting on any
subdivision plan, the Council may conduct a public hearing after
giving such notice as the Council may deem necessary in each case.
(7) Within 90 days after the date of approval by the governing body of
the final plat, the owner shall record an approved duplicate copy
thereof in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Dauphin County
and shall forthwith file with the governing body a Recorder's
certificate that the approved plat has been recorded, with the deed
book and page numbers indicated, and two copies of the recorded
plat, containing the time stamp of the office of the Recorder of
Deeds of Dauphin County.
(8) After a subdivision or land development plan shall have been
officially recorded, the streets, parks and other public
improvements shown thereon shall be considered to be a part of
the official plan of the Borough. Streets, parks and other public
improvements shown on a subdivision plan to be recorded may be
offered for dedication to the Borough by formal notation thereof on
such plan, or the owner may note on such plan that such
improvements have not been offered for dedication to the Borough.
Every street, park or other improvement shown on a subdivision
plan that shall have been recorded as provided herein shall be
deemed to be a private street, park or improvement until such time
as the same shall have been offered for dedication to the Borough
and accepted, by ordinance or resolution, or until it shall have been
condemned for use as a public street, park or other improvement.
(9) The recording of the plat shall not constitute grounds for
assessment increases until such time as lots are sold or

Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as amended,135 when an
application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or final, has
been approved or approved subject to conditions acceptable to the
applicant, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning,
subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to
adversely affect the right of the applicant to commence or to
complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance
with the terms of such approval within five years from such
approval.
A. Primary control points approved by the Engineer or description and ties

public sanitary sewer system and a water system to be connected to the
existing or proposed water system.
§ 238-24. Storm drainage.
A. Where a public sanitary sewer system is within 1,000 feet of or where
plans approved by the municipality provide for the installation of such
public sanitary sewer facilities to within 1,000 feet of a proposed
subdivision, the applicant shall provide the subdivision or land
development with a complete sanitary sewer system if, in the Borough
Council's opinion, it is feasible.
B. Where the installation of a sanitary sewer system is not required, the
applicant or owner of the lot shall provide for each lot, at the time
improvements are erected thereon, a private sewage disposal system
consisting of a septic tank and tile absorption field or other approved
sewage disposal system. All such individual sewage disposal systems
shall be constructed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act No. 537).139
C. Where a water main supply is within 1,000 feet or where plans
approved by the Borough Council provide for the installation of such
public water facilities, the applicant shall provide the subdivision or
land development with a complete water main supply system to be
connected to the existing or proposed water main supply system in
accordance with the Borough's specifications if, in the Borough
Council's opinion, it is feasible.

A. Whenever the evidence available to the Borough Council indicates that
natural surface drainage is inadequate, the applicant shall install storm
sewers, culverts and related facilities as necessary to permit the
unimpeded flow of natural watercourses, ensure the drainage of all low
points along the line of streets, intercept stormwater runoff along
streets at intervals reasonably related to the extent and grade of the
area drained and provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage
disposal facilities.
B. Storm drainage facilities must be designed not only to handle the
anticipated peak discharge from the property being developed but also
the anticipated increase in runoff that may occur when all the property
at a higher elevation in the same drainage basin is fully developed.
Engineering calculations for design must be submitted for review.
139. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 750.1 et seq.
§ 238-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-24
1:457
§ 238-25. Curbs and sidewalks.
The following are specifications for the construction of curb and sidewalk in
the Borough of Middletown:
C. Existing facilities. Whenever evidence available to the Borough Council
indicates that existing storm sewers are accessible, the applicant must
connect the stormwater facilities to the existing storm sewers. Facilities
will be considered available even though the applicant must acquire
right-of-way or easements to connect.
D. Abutting properties. In the design of storm drainage facilities, special
consideration must be given to preventing excess runoff onto adjacent
developed or undeveloped properties. Unless approved by the Borough
Council and the Planning Commission, no change may be made in the
existing topography which would:
(1) Result in increasing any portion of the slope steeper than one foot
of vertical measurement for three feet of horizontal measurement
for fills or one foot of vertical measurement for two feet of
horizontal measurement for cuts within a distance of 20 feet from
the property line, unless an adequate retaining wall or other
structure is provided.
(2) Result in slope which exceeds the normal angle of slippage of the
material involved. All slopes must be protected against erosion.
(3) Result in diverting water onto the property of another landowner.
E. Drainage upon and on streets.
(1) Upon streets. In order to give proper surface water drainage upon
streets, a structure on a lot must be at a grade in satisfactory
relationship:
(a) With the established street grade; or
(b) With the existing street grade where none is established.
(2) On streets. A street must be designed so as to provide for the
discharge of surface water from its right-of-way. The slope of the
crown on a street shall not be less than on 1/8 of an inch per foot
and not more than 1/3 of an inch per foot. Adequate facilities must
be provided at low points along the street and other points
necessary to intercept runoff.
A. Where the curb and sidewalk are laid with a grass plot, the curb and
sidewalk must be laid continuously across the entire width of the
property. All driveways must be at least three feet from the property
line. If the driveway or private walk is concrete, there shall be an
expansion joint on both sides of the sidewalk and at the curb across the
full width of the private walk or driveway.
§ 238-24 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 238-25
1:458
B. Poles in the concrete must be boxed where there are utility poles or
traffic posts in the walk. The pole or post must be boxed and separated
with an expansion joint so that the pole or post can be replaced with a
minimum of damage to the concrete. There should be three inches of
clearance.
C. For measurements where the curb and sidewalk are laid together, the
concrete must be scored to show the six-inch top of the curb. The walk
must rise (be graded) one inch higher at the back edge than the front
edge.
D. For measurements where the curb and sidewalk are laid separately, the
back of the curb must be vertical and the front edge beveled two inches.
The front edge of the sidewalk should be two inches higher than the top
of the curb, and the back edge must be one inch higher than the front
edge.
E. A dropped section of curb may have a dropped section or lower section
at the driveway (up to six inches depending on the lay of the land), but
the curb must be laid the entire width of the property.
F. Steps for private walks crossing a public walk should not be within 12
inches of the public walk.
G. General specifications.
(1) Curb. All new curbing along any street shall be built of concrete
only. A standard curb in the Borough of Middletown shall be a
minimum of eight inches in thickness at the bottom and six inches
at the top and 18 inches in depth.
(2) Sidewalk. New sidewalks constructed on the streets of the Borough
of Middletown shall be of one-course or two-course concrete
construction. Sidewalks shall be four inches thick, shall be scored,
in general, in four-foot sections, and in no case shall scored
sections be more than six feet in length. A one-half-inch expansion
joint shall be provided at least once every sixth section of sidewalk.
H. Downspout drainage. In cases where downspout water is discharged at
the front of a building, a four-inch pipe must be placed under the
sidewalk and through the curb. This will outlet the water into the
gutter. Downspout water should not be drained onto the sidewalk.
Small depressions in the walk and curb to provide for downspout water
are generally unsatisfactory and, under normal conditions, will not be
approved.
I. Handicap ramps shall be provided at all intersections where sidewalk
and/or curbing is proposed.
§ 238-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-26
1:459
§ 238-26. Curbs and gutters.

in width from the right-of-way line toward the curbline.
B. Sidewalks must be at least four feet wide in residential zoning districts
and at least six feet wide in all nonresidential zoning districts.
C. Sidewalks shall be constructed according to the specifications as set
forth in Section 676, Cement Concrete Sidewalks, in the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Specifications, 1994, as amended.
D. The applicant shall notify the Borough a minimum of 48 hours in
advance of the start of construction.

runoff shall be structurally retarded.
(9) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped, until the disturbed
area is stabilized, by the use of debris or sediment basins, silt traps
or similar measures.
C. Grading for drainage. To provide suitable sites for building and other
uses and to improve surface drainage and control erosion, the following
requirements shall be observed:
(1) All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings, dispersing it without ponding, and
all land within a development shall be graded to drain and dispose
of surface water without ponding, unless otherwise approved by
the Borough Council.

regrading or other development, it shall be the responsibility of the
person, corporation or other entity causing such sedimentation to
remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and
watercourses and to repair any damage.
(2) Maintenance of all drainage facilities and watercourses within any
land development or subdivision shall be the responsibility of the
applicant until such responsibility is accepted by the Borough or
other official agency.
(3) It shall be the responsibility of any person, corporation or other
entity performing any action on or across a communal stream,
watercourse or swale or upon a floodplain or right-of-way thereof to
maintain such facilities in their existing states as nearly as possible
during the pendency of the activity and to return them promptly to
their original or equal condition after such activity is completed.
(4) Maintenance of drainage facilities or watercourses which originate
and continue on an individual private property shall be the
responsibility of the owner of such property to the point of open
discharge at the property line or at a communal watercourse within
the property.
(5) No person, corporation or other entity shall commit any act which
will affect the normal or flood flow in any communal stream or

watercourse, a drainage easement or right-of-way shall be
provided, substantially conforming with the line of such
watercourse and of such width as will adequately preserve natural
drainage.
(7) Any person, corporation or other entity which makes or causes to
be made any change in a land surface shall be required to provide
the following:
(a) Facilities to collect on-site surface runoff and convey it to a
point of discharge into the common natural watercourse of the
drainage areas.
(b) A proportionate share of the total cost of off-site improvements
to the common natural watercourse, based on a fully developed
drainage area.
(c) Installation of all required drainage and erosion control
improvements (temporary and permanent) in accordance with
the standards and specifications of the municipality.

provided for in Subsection C above. However, the governing body may
allow the subdivision and/or development of area or sites for
commercial and industrial uses at an elevation less than 1 1/2 feet
above the regulatory flood if the developer otherwise protects the area
to that height or assures that the buildings or structures will be
floodproofed at least up to that height.
E. If the Borough determines that only a part of a proposed plat can be
safely developed, it shall limit development to that part and shall
require that development proceed consistent with this determination.
F. When an applicant does not intend to develop the plat himself and the
Borough determines that additional controls are required to ensure
safe development, it may require the applicant to impose appropriate
deed restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in
every deed and noted on every recorded plat.

All requests for a waiver shall be in writing and shall accompany and be a
part of the application for development. The request shall state in full the

The Borough Manager or his representative shall require that the
application for a building permit shall contain all information necessary to
enable him to ascertain whether the proposed building, alteration or use is
located in an approved subdivision. No building permit shall be issued until
the Borough Manager or his representative has certified that the site for the
proposed building, alteration or use complies with all the provisions of this
chapter and conforms to the site description as indicated on the approved
and recorded final plat. The Borough Engineer may advise the Borough

A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
provisions of any subdivision or land development ordinance enacted

municipality, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the municipality as a
result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or

Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the municipality may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the District Justice determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good
faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the
ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
District Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.
B. In addition to the above, in cases of a violation of this Subdivision and

subdivision; and may withhold any or all municipal services to the
subdivision until the violation is corrected or otherwise resolved to the
satisfaction of the Borough.

1:473
C. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.
D. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to
grant to any person or entity other than the municipality the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.

the Collector shall be liable for the tax and applicable penalties in full as
though the tax had originally been imposed against such employer. If

ARTICLE III
Parking Regulations
§ 252-19. General parking prohibitions.
A. No person shall park any vehicle at any time where no-parking signs
have been erected and/or where the curbs have been painted yellow to
indicate no parking.
B. No person shall park a vehicle, or permit it to stand, whether attended
or unattended, in any of the following places:
(1) Upon any bridge or in front of any theater or theater exit.
(2) Within 30 feet upon the approach to any stop sign.
(3) Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
(4) On a crosswalk or within 20 feet of a crosswalk.
(5) In front of a driveway (private or public) or garage.
(a) This includes the drive approach apron or the alley radius. The
phrase "in front of" includes all that area wherein the presence
of a parked vehicle would obstruct free, safe exit from or
entrance to such driveway. It is found as a fact that a
completely unobstructed and safe exit from the entrance to
such driveway in the light of the driveway and street or alley
widths and conditions associated therewith, including turning
and sight hazards, throughout the Borough of Middletown
requires that there be no parking within three feet on both
sides thereof.
(b) The parking in front of a driveway thus prohibited includes an
area, along the curb or cartway of the street or alley with
which it connects, within three feet on both sides of the
driveway. With respect to such three-foot sections,
enforcement may be implemented in the light of practicalities
reflected in the following severable considerations. The
resident owner (or tenant in possession with the owner's
permission) may paint the curb yellow in accordance with
precise measurement of said three-foot section and
specifications provided by the Code Enforcement Officer. Said
owner, or tenant, may notify the police of violations; and in the
absence of such notice, the police shall have no duty of
surveillance, investigation or ticketing. The only defense
before the District Justice of one who parks a vehicle so that it
projects within or occupies such a three-foot section shall be
that such person had the consent of said owner or tenant.
(6) Within an intersection or less than 25 feet from an intersection.
(7) On a sidewalk.
§ 252-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-19
1:511
§ 252-20. Parking of vehicles for repair purposes.
No vehicle, as defined in the Vehicle Code,159 shall be permitted by an
owner, operator or party in possession thereof to stand or be parked upon
any public street of the Borough of Middletown for the purpose of repair or
while undergoing work thereon in the situations specified in the following
Subsection A, and the penalty for violation shall be as set forth in
Subsection B hereof:
§ 252-21. Vehicles to be parked within marked spaces.
Wherever a space is marked off on any street for the parking of an individual
vehicle, every vehicle parked there shall be parked wholly within the lines
(8) On the roadway side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge
or curb of any street. [Added 8-1-1988 by Ord. No. 975]
(9) Against the flow of traffic. [Added 8-1-1988 by Ord. No. 975]
(10) More than 12 inches from the curb. [Added 8-1-1988 by Ord. No.
975]
A. Situations covered by this section are as follows:
(1) Parking or standing of a vehicle while undergoing work or repairs
involving jacking or blocking, pulling out of transmission or any
other work or repairs, whereby the vehicle is immobilized for more
than 24 hours.
(2) Parking or standing of a vehicle for or during work (or repairing)
involving the vehicle accompanied by or consisting of idling of
motor excessively or excessive emission of fumes, so as to annoy,
disturb or endanger unnecessarily the comfort, peace or repose of
reasonable persons with normal sensitivities.
(3) Parking or standing of a vehicle for or during the draining or
spilling of antifreeze, oil, grease or any substance, including
chemical substances of any kind, deleterious to street paving or to
public health, onto street paving, or the introduction or action
tending to introduction of any such substance or any contaminant
into the Borough storm drainage system.
B. Penalties for violations. Any person who shall violate any of the
provisions of this section shall, upon conviction thereof by a summary
proceeding, be sentenced to pay the costs in every case and a fine in the
amount of $25 for the first offense, $50 for the second offense and $100
for the third offense or for any subsequent offense; and upon refusal to
pay such fine and costs, to undergo imprisonment in the Dauphin
County Jail for a period not exceeding 10 days.

bounding that space, and it shall be a violation of this article for any person
to park a vehicle or allow it to remain parked otherwise.
§ 252-22. Angle parking.
No person shall park a vehicle upon any of the streets or parts thereof
described below except at the angle designated and only within the painted
stall lines. On all streets or portions thereof where angle parking is now or
shall hereafter be authorized, all vehicles parked thereon shall be parked

ARTICLE IV
Handicapped Parking
§ 252-28. Designation of spaces.
Parking spaces for the physically handicapped are hereby recognized and
established as special purpose parking spaces, as follows:
A. Existing spaces on present parking lots. The following spaces reserved
exclusively for parking by the physically handicapped are identified by
signs, bearing the internationally recognized wheelchair emblem, that
have been inspected and approved by the Chief of Police as readily
visible to and understandable by an ordinarily observant driver and
their validity and adequacy is hereby confirmed.
(1) Six spaces northward from entrance to Giant Store.
(2) Four spaces at Frey Village at its four entrances (main, personal
care, intermediate care and skilled nursing care).
(3) Two spaces northwestwardly from entrance to Interfaith
Apartments.
(4) Two spaces at west end of entrance to Borough Parking Lot.
(5) One space adjacent to front entrance to Hardee's.
(6) One space immediately north of Middletown Swim Club Building
entrance.
(7) Two spaces at the northwest corner in the parking lot of the
Middletown Municipal Swimming Pool. [Added 8-7-1989 by Ord.
No. 988]
B. Other parking spaces exclusively for the physically handicapped
provided at any time pursuant to building code provisions at any time
enacted. [Amended 7-11-2005 by Ord. No. 1194, approved
7-11-2005]
C. On all parking lots, including those antedating the requirements of
Subsection B emerging in the building code of Middletown, now or
hereafter providing 25 or more parking spaces, for each 25 such
spaces, one space shall be reserved exclusively for parking by the
physically handicapped, and this requirement is comparable to and
extended by analogy to the building code requirement (but postponing
an initial requirement of one such space where total parking in lot is up
to 25 spaces, pending further study). This Subsection C may be
enforced by the same penalties and remedies (hereby made applicable
and incorporated herein by reference) applicable to the building code
requirement concerning the required number of such spaces in relation
to total parking in lot. As under that same building code section, each
such reserved space shall be not less than 12 feet wide. As there, each
such parking space shall be identified by above-grade signs as reserved
§ 252-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-28
1:527
§ 252-29. Violations and penalties.
Any person who violates any provisions of this Article IV shall, upon
conviction thereof by a summary proceeding, be sentenced to pay costs in
every case and a fine in the amount of $15 and, upon refusal to pay such
for physically handicapped persons. These signs, complying, as the
Chief of Police may require, with the reserved parking sign R7-8
detailed in Pennsylvania Code § 211.241,162 will be a minimum of 12
inches by 12 inches, with green legend and border on white background
and with white symbol on blue background, the symbol being the
internationally recognized wheelchair symbol. Variations in signs, while
grounds for the Chief of Police to order replacement under the public
policy declared in 67 Pa. Code § 211.8,163 shall not inure as a defense to
the benefit of persons parking in any such space otherwise than for the
special purpose of parking for the physically handicapped.
(1) For cause shown, the Code Enforcement Officer as Building Official
may grant a variance or modify the requirements of Subsection C in
the spirit of the provisions under Section 315 of the BOCA Building
Code for modifications, upon application of the owner or the
owner's representative.
(2) The Chief of Police may allow 180 days from the effective date
hereof for compliance with Subsection C for identification of the
space or spaces advantageous for use of the physically
handicapped, for provision of the required twelve-foot width and
for installation of the above-grade signs, to avoid unnecessary
hardship with respect to existing facilities.
(3) The paving of such parking spaces shall be painted blue, covering
the entire area of each such space, and on that blue ground shall be
superimposed a white decal, approximately 48 by 36 inches in an
overall size, displaying the internationally recognized wheelchair
emblem. The purpose of this is to amplify notice (of which the
above-grade signs are deemed quite sufficient) that these are
special purpose parking spaces for the physically handicapped only.
No variation in and no deterioration in or absence of such decal or
painting shall inure as a defense to the benefit of persons parking
in any such space otherwise than for the special purpose of parking
for the physically handicapped. The Borough Manager is
authorized, but not required, to initiate a cooperative program for
such pavement marking and for future maintenance thereof.
D. Any person parking or causing to be parked a nonhandicapped licensed
vehicle in any handicapped parking zone located in the Borough shall
be ticketed and assessed a fine in accordance with § 252-29 of the
Middletown Borough Code. [Added 3-6-1995 by Ord. No. 1068]
162. Editor's Note: This section has since been reserved; see now 67 Pa. Code § 212.115.

Parking Lots
§ 252-30. Community Building parking lots. [Amended 8-5-2013 by
Ord. No. 1293]
§ 252-31. Borough Park and Ride Lot restrictions.
The Park and Ride Lot of the Borough of Middletown is located on the south
side of Mill Street and along the Philadelphia-Harrisburg rail line of Amtrak.
This Borough Parking Lot, with its western and eastern entrances and exits
on Mill Street and semicircular driveway, plus two traffic aisles paralleling
Mill Street, includes 71 parking spaces.
A. Special purpose parking spaces. The following are established as
special purpose parking spaces, and it shall be unlawful for any person
to park a vehicle or to allow a vehicle to remain parked in any such
space, except as specifically provided for that space, on the property of
the Borough of Middletown bounded by Scott Avenue, Brown Street
and Catherine Street and located south of the Community Building.
These spaces have or shall have appropriate signs or markings readily
visible to an ordinarily observant driver, and generally represent
continuation of existing restrictions for the purpose of making
applicable the tow-away and enforcement and penalty provisions of
Article VII of this chapter: [Amended 1-17-2017 by Ord. No. 1335]
(1) On the first row of parking spaces south of the Community
Building, the first two spaces near Catherine Street are for the
physically handicapped as provided in Article IV.
B. The parking lot on the property of the Borough of Middletown located
on the west side of South Catherine Street, immediately north of the
Brown Avenue right-of-way shall be for Borough employees and permit
holders as established in § 252-30A(4) between the hours of 7:00 a.m.
and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.164
C. Entrances and exits.
(1) Entrance from Catherine Street to said Community Building
parking lot is permitted only near Brown Street, at the southern
curb cut and traffic lane. The other or northern Catherine Street
curb cut and traffic lane near the Community Building may be used
only as an exit from said parking lot to Catherine Street. Violators
of this subsection, which has been found essential to a traffic flow
promoting safety, are likewise subject to the provisions of § 252-43
of this chapter and the penalties therein prescribed.
(2) At the curb cut on Brown Street, vehicles may enter and exit said
parking lot.
164. Editor's Note: This subsection refers to Subsection A(4) as it previously existed prior to
the amendment made by Ord. No. 1335, adopted 1-17-2017.
§ 252-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-31
1:531
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to park a vehicle, or to allow a
vehicle to remain parked, except in accordance with the on-site lines,
markings, signs and directions. For example, a vehicle may be parked
only within one space designated by lines on the bituminous paving as a
space for the parking of one vehicle.
B. The flow and pattern of traffic shall be in accordance with directions,
arrows and signs, and vehicular movement on the semicircular
driveway or on the two traffic aisles (paralleling Mill Street) in any
other manner of direction shall be unlawful.
C. Rules and regulations may be promulgated by resolutions of Borough
Council, in the light of experience, to implement, channel and confine
the uses of the lot in accordance with its design and purposes as well as
to facilitate maintenance, surveillance and related public purposes.
Overnight camping, for example, should thereby be and is hereby
prohibited as grossly beyond the purview of a Park and Ride Lot. The
same is true of the parking of tractor-trailers (or tractors or trailers)
overnight or at any time. Likewise, overnight parking is so inconsistent
with the normal operations of a commuter Park and Ride Lot that it is
prohibited except to the extent that such rules and regulations may
specifically permit as reasonable in certain instances thereof.

ARTICLE VI
Snow and Ice Emergencies
§ 252-32. Declaration of emergency.
§ 252-33. Driving restrictions.
During such snow emergency, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate
any kind of motor vehicle on any street unless such vehicle shall be
equipped with adequate equipment to provide sufficient traction to keep
such vehicle in motion so that other traffic will not be blocked or seriously
impeded. It shall be a violation thereof also for the operator of a
noncommercial passenger vehicle which stalls on any street during such
emergency, if such stalling shall have been by reason of the failure to have
such vehicle equipped with skid chains or with snow tires having antiskid
patterns impressed or cut into the treaded surfaces to form bars, buttons or
blocks especially designed to give effective traction on snow.
§ 252-34. Snow emergency streets designated; no parking.
[Amended 11-7-1994 by Ord. No. 1059, approved 11-7-1994;
6-4-2019 by Ord. No. 1363]
During such emergency, it shall be unlawful for any person to park, or to
permit to remain parked, on any street named below any type of motor
vehicle, boat, boat trailer, camper, recreational vehicles or any trailer used
for the purpose of hauling motor vehicles or other items, with respect to the
north side of east-west streets or with respect to the east side of north-south
streets, unless otherwise indicated. However, upon complete removal of all

towing and storage.
Removal and impounding of vehicles under this article shall be done only
by approved storage garages that shall be designated from time to time by
the Council. Every such garage shall submit evidence to the Council that

to the Council as sufficient to indemnify owners of impounded vehicles
against loss or damage to those vehicles while in the custody of the garage
keeper for the purpose of towing or storage. The approved storage garage

ARTICLE IX
Unreserved Handicapped Parking
[Adopted 9-4-2018 by Ord. No. 1354]
§ 252-45. Definitions.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following words and phrases shall be
construed throughout this article to have the following meanings:
APPLICANT  A property owner (or the parent or guardian of the resident)
who files an application for the installation of an unreserved handicapped
parking space.
BLOCK  The section of a Borough street identified by the hundreds, for
example 0-99, 100-199, 200-299.
BOROUGH  The Borough of Middletown.
DEPARTMENT  The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
RESIDENT  One who occupies real estate within a block of a Borough
street and such real estate is used as his/her principal residence.
UNRESERVED HP SPACE  A parking space dedicated for use by
handicapped persons or disabled veterans utilizing vehicles lawfully
bearing handicapped or disabled veteran registration plates or permanent
placards.
§ 252-46. Application process.
A. The application for the installation of an unreserved HP space shall be
made available to any resident who is an owner of property in the
Borough. Application fees shall be set by Borough resolution.
B. Application. The application will be designed and developed by the
Borough, but shall require, at a minimum, the identity of the applicant,
the address of the applicant, the type of disability per the eligibility
requirements and reasons defined by the Department, whether
handicapped accessible off-street parking is available immediately
adjacent to or on the applicant's property, the location of the current
unreserved HP spaces on the same block where the applicant resides,
proof of a valid unexpired handicapped or disabled veteran registration
plate or permanent placard issued by the Department, an appropriate
waiver of applicable privacy laws prepared by the Borough Solicitor,
and a signature section. The application shall also contain a clause
informing the applicant that the applicant is required to notify the
Borough immediately if and when the applicant moves from the address
set forth on the application or no longer has a disability or possesses a
valid handicapped registration plate or permanent placard. Upon the
receipt of any application from such handicapped or disabled individual
or such person's parent or guardian, the Borough may collect other
relevant information as the Borough deems necessary to process the
application.
§ 252-45 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-47
1:541
§ 252-47. Eligibility and determination.
A. In general. After acquiring a handicapped or disabled veteran's
registration plate or permanent placard from the Department, any
Borough property owner may file an application for the creation of an
unreserved HP space in front of the property where the resident
resides. The possession of a handicapped or disabled veteran's
registration plate or permanent placard does not guarantee that the
resident's application for an unreserved HP space will be granted.
(Disabled parking permits and/or temporary placards do not satisfy this
requirement.)
B. Criteria. In order to provide an adequate number of unreserved HP
spaces in a particular block and to preserve adequate parking spaces
for all Borough residents, before the Borough creates an unreserved HP
space, the Borough must determine that the limitations upon the
number and placement of unreserved HP spaces on a particular block
will not be exceeded if the requested unreserved HP space is created,
that the applicant has proven that there is no handicapped accessible
off-street parking available to the applicant that the applicant should
reasonably be able to use given applicant's disability, that the applicant
possesses a handicapped or disabled veteran's registration plate or
permanent placard, and there is sufficient length of on-street parking
available inside the frontage boundary of the applicant's property or
written approval to encroach on the frontage of the neighboring
property has been provided.
C. Final determination. After collecting all pertinent information, the
Borough will review and investigate all information related to the
application. The Borough may approve and authorize the creation of the
unreserved HP space and installation signage in accordance with
applicable state laws and regulations, as well as defining the duration of
its validity, if Borough Council determines the applicant has met the
requirements of this article. In the event Borough Council determines
the applicant has not met the requirements of this article, Borough
Council shall deny the application and inform the applicant in writing as
to the denial and the reason(s) for the denial. Borough Council's
decision shall be final.
D. Nonexclusive right. If an unreserved HP space is created under this
article, the unreserved HP space created may be used by any person
parking a vehicle lawfully bearing registration plates or a permanent
placard issued to handicapped persons or disabled veterans. This
article shall not be construed as granting the applicant the exclusive
right to park his/her vehicle in the unreserved HP space created
hereunder.
E. Other parking regulations. Nothing in this article shall exempt
individuals utilizing unreserved HP spaces from other parking
restrictions applicable to the space/block.
§ 252-47 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 252-48
1:542
§ 252-48. Limitation on number of unreserved handicapped parking
spaces.
Borough Council may not authorize unreserved HP space(s) in excess of the
limitations set forth below:
§ 252-49. Placement of signs.
A. Roadways. The maximum number of unreserved HP spaces is two per
one length of block, whether the street is one-way traffic or two-way
traffic on streets where parking is permitted.
B. Other parking restrictions. Borough Council may consider other
parking restrictions applicable to a particular block and other
information regarding the block including but not limited to the size of
the block, and may further restrict the number of unreserved HP spaces
to maintain an adequate number of unregulated parking spaces, as they
deem appropriate.
C. Existing unreserved HP spaces. Unreserved HP spaces in excess of the
limitations set forth in this section and existing on the effective date of
this ordinance shall be permitted to remain in place, subject to removal
after the annual reporting requirement set forth in § 252-50.
A. Generally. For a single application for an unreserved HP space, sign
placements will be positioned in front of the applicant's property. If the
applicant does not have adequate frontage, the applicant shall be
required to supply written approval to encroach on neighboring
property.
B. Authority to post. The Borough of Middletown Public Works Director
shall direct all postings, sign removals and replacements of unreserved
HP spaces in accordance with Department rules and regulations. The
Public Works Director will report the posting or removal of handicapped
parking signs and all actions taken upon applications for unreserved HP
spaces to the Borough Council at the next scheduled workshop
meeting.
C. Disputes regarding sign placement. The Code Enforcement Office shall
be responsible for investigating Borough and resident complaints
regarding the placement of handicapped parking signs. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall require all complaints be in writing and shall
conduct an investigation of the complaint within 90 calendar days.
Upon conducting an investigation, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
report the complaint, its investigation, and the Code Enforcement
Officer's recommendation to Borough Council. Borough Council shall
resolve all complaints in a manner it deems just and appropriate,
including but not limited to the removal of the unreserved HP space.
The complainant, block residents, applicant and Borough, including the
Code Enforcement Officer, shall be entitled to present evidence to the
Borough Council. Strict rules of evidence shall not apply, but Borough

Handicapped parking spaces existing in the Borough on the effective date
of this article shall be permitted to remain in place subject to the annual
renewal and reporting requirements set forth herein and shall be added to
the Borough's list of HP spaces.
§ 252-52. False statements.
It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and willfully, with the intent
to deceive, make a false statement to any public official for purposes of
obtaining an unreserved HP space.
§ 252-53. Recordkeeping.
The Borough Manager or his or her designee shall create and maintain a
list of all unreserved HP spaces authorized throughout the Borough and
shall update said list as often as may be necessary to add newly authorized
spaces and to remove ineligible or unauthorized spaces.
Council may limit or prohibit irrelevant, repetitive and/or hearsay
testimony. The Code Enforcement Officer shall inform the complainant,
applicant, and interested parties of Borough Council's action upon the
complaint.
A. Annual renewal and reporting. After approval of the application, the
applicant shall submit an application annually along with a renewal fee
which shall be set by Borough resolution. The renewal application shall
require the applicant to verify the continuance of his/her disability. In
January of each year, the Borough Secretary shall mail (via regular firstclass
mail) each applicant (and applicants under prior rules and
regulations) the renewal application referenced herein. If the applicant
fails to submit the application for renewal by March 15 of that year or
the Borough Council determines the applicant is no longer eligible for
an unreserved HP space, the Borough Council shall inform the Director
of Public Works that the unreserved HP space should be removed. The
Borough Manager shall give written notice of the Borough Council
determination that the applicant is no longer eligible for an unreserved
HP space to the applicant within 30 days of the Borough's receipt of the
renewal application.
B. Registration plates and permanent placards. The applicant shall be
solely responsible for the cost of any and all state-regulated
applications, filings, and documentation required for a handicapped
and/or disabled veteran's registration plate or permanent placard. The
registration plate or permanent placard must be conspicuously
displayed while the vehicle is parked in a public unreserved HP space.

§ 252-54. Violations and penalties.
Any person who violates this provision shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 plus costs of prosecution.
Each day during which a violation occurs shall constitute a separate offense.
This section does not limit or prohibit citation for violations of laws and
regulations enacted by the Department under the Vehicle Code.
§ 252-55. Repealer.
All prior ordinances or parts of ordinances or resolutions or policies that are
inconsistent herewith shall be and the same expressly are repealed.

No. 1194, approved 7-11-2005]
A. Service connection will be made and water will be furnished upon
written application by the prospective consumer (or his properly
authorized agent), on a blank prepared by the Borough for this purpose,
and after the approval of such application by the Borough. The
application for service shall be general and shall clearly outline the
class, scope and type of use to be made of the service, as well as the
purpose for which it will be used, and each application shall state the
services.
B. The application and these rules and regulations constitute the contract
between the consumer and the Borough, and each consumer, by taking
of water, agrees to be bound thereby.
C. A new application must be made to and approved by the Borough upon
any change in identity of the contracting consumer at a property or in
the service as described in the application, and the Borough may, upon
five days' notice, discontinue the water supply until such new
application has been made and approved.
A. The Borough shall make all connections to its water mains and install
and maintain all service lines from the main to and including the curb
cock and box, which shall be placed from one to two feet inside the
curbline, all of which service lines shall be the property of the Borough,
shall be installed at the property owner's expense and shall be
accessible to the Borough and under Borough control. The cost of
installation from the curb cock and box shall be at the property owner's
expense. No connection to the waterlines of the Borough of Middletown
shall be made unless and until said property owner shall have made
application for said service to the Borough of Middletown and received
a permit therefor and shall have paid to the Borough of Middletown a
tapping or connection fee in an amount as set forth in a fee schedule
§ 256-1 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 256-3
1:548
established by a properly adopted resolution of the Council of the
Borough of Middletown.
B. Certain work required for water service shall be performed by a private
contractor, at the determination of the Borough, when conditions
require. Such work may include, but is not limited to, water service
connections under state-owned highways and roads, connections at a
depth greater than eight feet, connections that require bypass pumping
prior to connection, or any other situation where the Borough does not
have adequate manpower, time or equipment to accomplish such work.
C. The property owner shall, at the property owner's expense, dig and fill
the trench and furnish and install the service line from the curb stop to
the premises to be supplied and, in all respects, shall be responsible for
any and all injury or damage in consequence thereof and/or resulting
therefrom.
D. Scheduling shall be coordinated with the Borough before any service is
installed. The property owner shall provide to the Borough the street
and lot number or location where service is desired, the name of the
owner and tenant and the time when the trench will be ready for
making the connection.

condition by the owner under penalty of discontinuance of service by
the Borough.
F. Under no circumstances shall any person not authorized by the
Borough turn the stop cock on or off in any public or private line.
G. Hereafter, in all future installations or reinstallations of service lines,
only one property shall be supplied through one service. When one pipe
supplies more than one metered customer, said customers shall have a
curb stop installed at the expense of the customer to provide for
separate shutoff. Any violation of the rules of the Borough by either the
property owner or his tenant, or any leakage in such joint lines, shall
cause the main stops to be shut off or, where a division of ownership of
such line occurs, the Borough may require a separate service line for
each customer, giving reasonable time for any innocent customer to
make such arrangements before discontinuance of service results.
H. Where capital extensions to the waterlines of the Borough are made
under the authority of this section, said capital extensions shall be
made by the Borough at the cost to the abutting property owner by a
front foot assessment to be established by the Borough Engineer after
the capital extension has been completed. When the Borough Engineer
has certified that the capital extensions have been completed by filing a
copy of said completion certificate with the Borough Secretary, which
certificate shall include all assessable costs and all assessable front
feet, Borough Council shall then determine the amount of assessable
front feet which shall be charged against the abutting property owner,
which sum shall not exceed the actual costs of erecting or extending the
§ 256-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 256-3
1:549
water mains, including engineering and legal fees, if any, and costs of
printing and advertising, and shall equitably assess the costs against
each and every property abutting the line of improvement, making
allowances for corner lots and lots of irregular shape where the
assessment for the full frontage would be unjust.
I. Any person or organization desiring to connect an extension to any
Borough water main shall submit a detailed plan of the proposed layout
and construction of the water main extension to the Borough Engineer
for approval. Said water main extension plan shall be accompanied by a
nonrefundable fee, the amount of which shall be set forth in a fee
schedule established by a properly adopted resolution of the Council of
the Borough of Middletown.
J. Any person who shall make a connection to the water system of the
Borough of Middletown without having first secured a permit and paid
the connection fee or who shall close said excavation, trench, or ditch
before inspection of said connection shall be punishable as provided in
§ 256-15 of this article, and the connection made may be disconnected
by the proper Borough employee without any notification to the
offending property owner.
K. The property owner shall place a brass lever handle stop and waste
cock in the service pipe within the wall of the building, supplied and so

ARTICLE II
Tapping Fees
[Adopted 12-3-2001 by Ord. No. 1146, approved 12-3-2001]
§ 256-16. Purpose.
Middletown Borough Council has determined, based upon a study and
report prepared by its consulting engineer, that a substantial expenditure
must be made for capital additions and improvements to the existing water
system and appurtenant facilities operated by Middletown Borough in order
to provide service for future users of the water system, and has further
determined that the cost of construction and financing of such capital
additions and improvements would create an unreasonable and inequitable
economic burden upon the Borough and the existing users of the water
system. It is, therefore, deemed to be in the public interest of the Borough,
the existing users of the water system, and future users, that all improved
properties hereafter connected to the water system pay a tapping fee
designed and calculated to create a capital reserve fund to provide the cost
of construction and financing of such capital additions and improvements.
The purpose of this article is to provide for the imposition and collection of
such tapping fees.
§ 256-17. Definitions.
When used in this article, the following words, terms and phrases shall have
prescribed to them the meanings hereafter set forth:
APARTMENT OR OFFICE USE  A building which is intended to be used
for continuous or periodic habitation by human beings and containing two
or more family dwelling units; or which contains business or professional
offices and one or more family dwelling units; or which contains business,
professional or any other similar type of office or offices.
AUTHORITY  Middletown Borough Municipal Authority.
BOROUGH  The Borough of Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.
COMMERCIAL USE  A property which is intended to be used for the
purpose of carrying on a trade, business or profession, or for social,
religious, educational, charitable or public uses.

product, commodity or article.
OWNER  Any person vested with ownership, legal or equitable, sole or
partial, of any improved property.

fee as set forth in the schedule of fees. Such application shall be made on a
form to be provided by the Borough and shall be obtained from the office of
the Code Enforcement Officer.
§ 256-19. Imposition of fees.
A. A tapping fee is hereby imposed against any improved property and
against the owner of such improved property whenever the owner
hereafter shall connect any such improved property with a water main
constituting a portion of the water system owned by the Authority and
leased to the Borough, in the amount as set forth in the schedule of fees
for each EDU required, or the equivalent flow required by, regardless of
whether the water mains or extensions thereto are installed by the
owner, developer or by this Borough. In the case of residential uses
having multiple units or uses therein, a separate tapping fee shall be
paid for each dwelling unit or apartment. In all other types of uses, a
separate tapping fee shall be paid for each EDU or the equivalent flow
required by such use, based upon the total estimated average flow
needed by such improved property. However, where the actual average
daily flow needed by such property during any quarterly billing period
during the first year after substantial occupancy exceeds the estimated
flow, the owner of such improved property shall be required to pay the

connected to and served by the water system where such fees or charges
are not paid as provided herein. Said lien shall be filed in the office of the
Prothonotary of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, and shall be collected in the
manner provided by law for the filing and collecting of municipal claims.
(1) In those cases where an improved property is already connected to
the water system, and where there is an expansion of, addition to or
a change in the use of such improved property which results in an
increase in the volume of water required by such property, an
additional tapping fee shall be paid for each additional EDU or the
equivalent flow required as a result of such expansion, addition or
change in use, based upon the additional estimated average daily
flow of water to such improved property. If, during any quarterly
billing period during the first year after substantial occupancy, the
average daily flow exceeds said estimated average daily flow, the
owner of such improved property shall be required to pay the
additional tapping fees as determined from the actual flow records.
In the case of domestic uses and apartment or office uses, an
additional tapping fee shall be paid for each additional dwelling
unit or apartment or each office or suite of offices added as a result
of an expansion of, addition to, or a change in the use of such
improved property.
(2) The Borough Council shall establish a fee schedule for water
tapping fees by a properly approved resolution of the Borough
Council.
B. A water connection fee is hereby imposed against any improved
property and against the owner of such improved property whenever
the owner hereafter shall connect any such improved property with a
water main constituting a portion of the water system owned by the
Authority and leased to the Borough. The Borough Council shall
establish a fee schedule for water connection fees by a properly
approved resolution of the Borough Council.
C. A water customer facilities fee is hereby imposed against any improved
property and against the owner of such improved property whenever
the owner hereafter shall connect any such improved property with a
water main constituting a portion of the water system owned by the

establish a fee schedule for water customer facilities fees by a properly
approved resolution of the Borough Council.

1:571
In addition, the payment of said tapping fees imposed hereunder may be
enforced by this Borough in any manner appropriate under existing laws at
the time they become due and payable.
§ 256-22. Segregation of funds.
All revenues received by this Borough from the tapping fees imposed by this
article shall be segregated by accounting practices from other revenues of
the Borough received in connection with the operation of the water system,
and shall be credited to a capital reserve account. Said revenues shall be
used for the purpose of construction and financing of such capital additions
and improvements to the water system as may be required from time to
time.

elevation requirement involved, no variance shall be granted
for any of the other requirements pertaining specifically to
development regulated by special permit or to development
which may endanger human life.
(d) If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
(e) In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
attach whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it
considers necessary in order to protect the public health,

addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage or repetitive loss, regardless of the
actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any
project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have
been identified by the local Code Enforcement Official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this chapter
must comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude
the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

§ 260-142. Establishment of airport zones.
There are hereby created and established certain zones within the Airport
Zoning Overlay District, defined in this chapter and depicted on Figure 1189
and illustrated on the Borough of Middletown, Dauphin County, PA: Airport
Zoning Overlay District Map as follows:
§ 260-143. Permit applications.
§ 260-144. Variances.
A. Approach Surface Zone.
B. Conical Surface Zone.
C. Horizontal Surface Zone.
D. Primary Surface Zone.
E. Transitional Surface Zone.
A. As regulated by Act 164 and defined by 14 CFR 77.13(a) (as amended or
replaced), proposals for applications to:
(1) Erect a new structure whose height does not surpass that of the
primary structure on the property;
(2) Add to or increase the height of an existing primary structure; or
(3) Establish, erect, and/or maintain any use, structure, or object
(natural or man-made), in the Airport Zoning Overlay District:
shall first notify the Department's Bureau of Aviation (BOA) by
submitting PennDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review
of the proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof.
The Department's BOA response must be included with this permit
application for it to be considered complete. If the Department's
BOA returns a determination of no penetration of airspace, the
permit request should be considered in compliance with the intent
of this overlay ordinance. If the Department's BOA returns a
determination of a penetration of airspace, the permit shall be
denied, and the project sponsor may seek a variance from such
regulations as outlined in § 260-144.
B. Exceptions. In the following circumstances, notification of an approval
by PennDOT's Bureau of Aviation (BOA) shall not be required:
(1) No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace
parts of existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the
height of an existing structure.

1:694
§ 260-145. Use restrictions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use shall be made
of land or water within the Airport District Overlay in such a manner as to:
A. In addition to the provisions set forth in § 260-233E relating to
variances, any request for a variance shall include documentation in
compliance with 14 CFR 77, Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-1, as amended
or replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a variance will depend
on the determinations made by the FAA and the Department's BOA as to
the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable air space. In particular, the
request for a variance shall consider which of the following categories
the FAA has placed the proposed construction in:
(1) No objection. The subject construction is determined not exceed
obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not required to
mitigate potential hazard. Under this determination, a variance
shall be granted.
(2) Conditional determination. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport
hazard area which can be effectively mitigated. Under this
determination, a variance shall be granted contingent upon
implementation of mitigating measures as described in § 260-147,
Obstruction marking and lighting.
(3) Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined
to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be denied
and the reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the
applicant.
B. Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that
a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the
public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this
chapter.
A. Create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft;
B. Make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and
others;
C. Impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport;
D. Create bird strike hazards; or
E. Otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the airport(s).
§ 260-144 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-146
1:695
§ 260-146. Preexisting nonconforming uses.
The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or
tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this
chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming
use. No nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to
grow higher, so as to increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming use,
once substantially abated (subject to the underlying zoning ordinance) may
only be reestablished consistent with the provisions herein.
§ 260-147. Obstruction marking and lighting.
Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this article
may be conditioned according to the process described in § 260-233E to
require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question
to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person
requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate, and maintain such
marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure both ground and air
safety.

H. In the case of tanks or tank systems subject to Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection regulation, the removal
required under this section of this chapter shall be completed within 60
days of written certification from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection that the tank and tank system are empty,
clean, secure and that there is no spillage to be remediated. In the case
of tanks or tank systems not subject to Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection regulation, the removal required under this
section of this chapter shall be completed within 60 days of the
cessation of use of the tanks or tank systems. The Borough, upon
written request, and in its sole discretion, may permit an additional
thirty-day period or periods for the removal of the tanks or tank systems
to be completed in either of the above cases, but only if doing so is in
compliance with applicable Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
requirements and is approved by the Fire Marshal.

stopped and the use is not actively advertised for sale or lease.
Such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be reinstated except
in conformance with this chapter. A nonconforming building or
land, which is actively marketed, but has not been sold or leased,

actively marketed, or purchased within one year or less) shall
constitute abandonment of the site, and any occupation or
subsequent use of said site shall conform with the provisions of this
chapter.

existing use in such changed district may be continued, provided that
no structural alterations are made other than those permitted by this
chapter.
E. Extension of expansion. A nonconforming use, building or structure, not
including signs, may be extended or expanded in compliance with the
following:

nonconforming. Expansion or extension onto adjoining lots is
prohibited.
(2) Nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout the
building.

same lot, in compliance with Subsection E(5) below, and provided
that the nonconforming use continues in the existing building.
(4) A building which houses a nonconforming use may be expanded by
no more than 25% of its gross floor area at the time it became
nonconforming.
(5) Extension and/or expansion as provided for above shall be
permitted only to extent that all new construction shall comply with
the dimensional standards of the district in which the building is
located, except that expansion of a building that is nonconforming
with respect to a required setback may be built on line with the

A. Buildings that are under construction at the time they become
nonconforming may be continued to completion, provided that valid
building permits have been issued for those buildings and substantial
construction has begun. If the building was intended for a use which
has become nonconforming after construction of the building had
begun, the building may be occupied and used for that legal use
intended at the time the building permit was issued, or for one which is
otherwise in conformance with the regulations for the zoning district in
which the building is located.
B. Nonconforming primary structures damaged or destroyed by fire,
explosion, accident of calamity (as contrasted to deterioration due to
time or neglect) may be reconstructed and used as before, provided
that:
(1) The reconstructed building shall not exceed the dimensions of the
damaged or destroyed building, including height, width, depth,

to the following regulations:
(1) Said lot may be used as otherwise permitted in that district
following the granting of a variance by the Zoning Hearing Board
for the particular use.
(2) Where two or more contiguous undeveloped lots are held in single
ownership within a subdivision which has been duly recorded prior
to the effective date of this chapter, which lots are individually not
of the required minimum area or width for the district in which they
are situated, such lots shall be developed in groups thereof in order
to provide the minimum lot area and frontage required for each lot.
B. Exception. A nonconforming lot of record, which is part of a subdivision
plan approved by Borough Council and recorded in the office of
Recorder of Deeds as such and which is in compliance with the zoning
regulations in effect immediately prior to the date of enactment of this

shall make the initial determination. The Zoning Officer may seek the
advice of the Borough Planning Committee, Borough Solicitor and/or
others in making a determination.

must refuse to confer nonconforming status.
C. If the applicant disagrees with the Zoning Officer's determination, the
applicant may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board as provided by law.

B. The Borough may, at its option, issue combined or separate building
permits and zoning permits and/or may utilize a single or separate
application for the permits.
C. The only determination by the Zoning Officer that shall be official shall
be a written determination after the Zoning Officer receives a duly

commenced or changed prior to obtaining such permit and after notice
by the Borough, the fees set by ordinance or resolution of the Borough
Council for such permit shall be doubled. The doubling of the permit fee
shall be required to reflect the additional expense incurred by the
Borough resulting from the need to inspect the property, respond to any
complaints, and issue any enforcement notices and/or process the
application as soon as it is received. The payment of such increased
permit fee shall not relieve any person from complying with all

applied for, he shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practical but not
later than 90 days from receipt of the application.
L. Reconsideration of application. An applicant whose request for a permit

applicant proves to the Zoning Officer that the activity or
occupancy can occur safely without endangering public health or

eligible to receive approval for commercial-type activities in a
district where a commercial use would not otherwise be permitted;
(2) Temporary storage and office trailers that are necessary to serve
on-site construction, while such construction is actively underway;
(3) Such other activities that the applicant proves are routine,

(1) Enforcement. If it appears to the Borough that a violation of this
chapter has occurred, the Borough shall initiate enforcement
proceedings by sending an enforcement notice, as provided in this
section. Prior to sending an official enforcement notice, the Zoning
Officer may at his/her option informally request compliance.
(2) Enforcement notice. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the
owner of record of the parcel on which the violation has occurred,
to any person who has filed a written request to receive
enforcement notices regarding that parcel, and to any other person
requested, in writing, by the owner of record. An enforcement
notice shall state the following, at minimum:
(a) The name of the owner of record and any other person against
whom the Borough of Middletown intends to take action.
(b) The location of the property in violation.
(c) The specific violation with a description of the requirements
which have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable
provisions of this chapter.

commenced and the date before which the steps must be
completed.
(e) That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within 15 days, in accordance with
procedures set forth in this chapter.
(f) That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified,
unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board,
constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly
described.
(3) Evidence and fees. In any appeal of an enforcement notice to the
Zoning Hearing Board, the Borough shall have the responsibility of
presenting its evidence first. Any filing fees paid by a party to an
appeal to an enforcement notice to the Zoning Hearing Board shall
be returned to the appealing party by the Borough if the Zoning
§ 260-230 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-230
1:787
§ 260-231. Fees.
Determination. The Borough Council may, by resolution, establish fees for
the administration of this chapter. All fees shall be determined by a schedule
that is made available to the general public. The Borough Council may
reevaluate the fees schedule and make necessary alterations to it. Such
alterations shall not be considered an amendment to this chapter and may
be adopted at any public meeting of the Borough Council.
Hearing Board, or any court in a subsequent appeal, rules in the
appealing party's favor.
(4) Cause of action. If the enforcement notice is not complied with
within the specified time period, the Zoning Officer shall notify the
Borough Council. With the consent of the Borough Council, the
Borough Solicitor or other officer of the Borough may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or
abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent in
or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use
constituting a violation.
(5) Violations and penalties. Any person, partnership or corporation
who or which has violated or permitted the violation of the
provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in
a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay a
judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including the
reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Borough as a result
thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
District Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals
the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to
the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the District
Justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed
that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination by the District Justice, and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorney's
fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid over to
the Borough. Imprisonment shall not be authorized by this chapter.
(6) The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant any order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.
(7) Nothing in this section shall be construed or interpreted to grant to
any person or entity, other than the Borough, the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.

the validity of this chapter and/or map is in question, and shall
give the place where and the times when a copy of the request,
including any plans, explanatory material or proposed

defined herein, the Borough Council must publish a reference to
the time and place of the meeting at which passage of this chapter
or amendment will be considered, and a reference to a place within
the Borough where copies of the proposed ordinance or
amendment may be examined without charge, or obtained for a
charge not greater than the cost thereof. Enactment notice shall be
published at least once in one newspaper of general circulation in
Middletown Borough not more than 60 days nor less than seven

may include a specific statement as to whether or not the proposed
amendment is in accordance with the intent of this chapter and any
officially adopted Comprehensive Plan of the Borough of
Middletown. The Borough Council cannot act upon the amendment
until it has received a recommendation from the Borough Planning
Committee; however, should the Borough Planning Committee fail
to submit its recommendation within 45 days, the Borough Council
may proceed without its recommendation.
(5) County planning committee referrals. All proposed amendments
shall be submitted to the County Planning Committee at least 30
§ 260-232 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 260-232
1:790
days prior to public hearing on such amendments. The County

the proposal, inform the public, receive public comment, and/or
render a decision, it may adjourn the public hearing to a specific
time and place.
(7) Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this
chapter shall be forwarded to the County Planning Committee.
C. Amendment initiated by the Borough Planning Committee. When an
amendment, supplement, change or repeal is initiated by the Borough
Planning Committee, the proposal shall be presented to the Borough
Council which shall then proceed in the same manner as with a petition
to the Borough Council which has already been reviewed by the
Borough Planning Committee.

supplement, change or repeal is initiated by the Borough Council, such
amendment, supplement, change or repeal shall follow the procedure

for amendment, supplement, change or repeal for a portion of this
chapter shall include an accurate legal description and surveyed plan of
any land to be rezoned, and all of the reasons supporting the petition to
be considered. The petition shall also be signed by at least one record
owner of the property in question whose signature shall be notarized
attesting the truth and correctness of all the facts and information
presented in the petition. A fee to be established by Borough Council
shall be paid upon the filing of such petition for change and for the
purpose of defraying the costs of the proceedings prescribed herein.
The Borough Council may require duplicate sets of petition materials.
F. Curative amendment by a landowner. A landowner who desires to
challenge on substantive grounds the validity of this chapter or the
Official Zoning Map or any provision thereof which prohibits or restricts
the use or development of land in which he has an interest, may submit
a curative amendment to the Borough Council, including all of the
reasons supporting the request to be considered, with a written request
that his challenge and proposed amendment be heard and decided as
provided in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,208 as
amended. The Borough Council shall commence a hearing thereon
§ 260-232 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-232
1:791
within 60 days of the request. The curative amendment shall be
referred to the County Planning Commission as provided for in
§ 260-232 and public notice of the hearing shall be provided as defined
herein.
(1) In reviewing the curative amendment, the Borough Council may
deny the request, accept the request as submitted, or may adopt an
alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects. The
Borough Council shall consider the curative amendments, plans
and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall
also consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(b) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of
the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of this
chapter or map;
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features;
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and
any adverse environmental impacts; and
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(2) The Borough Council shall render its decision within 45 days after
the conclusion of the last hearing.
(3) If the Borough Council fails to act on the landowner's request
within the time limits referred to above, a denial of the request is
deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last
hearing.
(4) Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
this chapter or Zoning Map is in question and shall give the place
where and the times when a copy of the request, including any
plans, explanatory material or proposed amendments may be
examined by the public.
208. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 260-232 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 260-232
1:792
(5) The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
(a) The Borough Council fails to commence the hearing within 60
days;
(b) The Borough Council notified the landowner that it will not
adopt the curative amendment;
(c) The Borough Council adopts another curative amendment
which is unacceptable to the landowner; or
(d) The Borough Council fails to act on the request 45 days after
the close of the last hearing on the request, unless the time is
extended by mutual consent by the landowner and Borough of
Middletown.
(6) Where a curative amendment proposal is approved by the grant of
a curative amendment application by the Borough Council
pursuant to this section or a validity challenge is sustained by the
Zoning Hearing Board or the court acts finally on appeal from
denial of a curative amendment proposal or a validity challenge,
and the proposal or challenge so approved requires a further
application for subdivision or land development, the developer
shall have two years from the date of such approval for a
subdivision, land development or planned residential development.
Within the two-year period, no subsequent change or amendment
in the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan
shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights of
the applicant as granted in the curative amendment or the
sustained validity challenge. Upon the filing of the preliminary or
tentative plan, the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code209 shall apply.
(7) Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment
application or the validity challenge is approved but does not
require further application under any subdivision or land
development ordinance, the developer shall have one year within
which to file for a zoning permit. Within the one-year period, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of applicant as granted in the
curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. During
these protected periods, the court shall retain or assume
jurisdiction for the purposes of awarding such supplemental relief
as may be necessary.
G. Curative amendment by the Borough Council.
(1) The Borough Council, by formal action, may declare this chapter or
portions thereof substantively invalid and propose to prepare a
209. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 260-232 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-232
1:793
curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days
following such declaration proposal, the Borough Council shall:
(a) By resolution, make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of this chapter or portions thereof which may
include:
[1] References to specific uses which are either not permitted
or not permitted in sufficient quantity;
[2] References to a class of use or uses which require revision;
or
[3] References to the entire ordinance which requires
revisions.
(b) Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to this
chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
(2) Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Borough Council shall enact a curative amendment to validate or
reaffirm the validity of this chapter pursuant to the provisions
required by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code210 in
order to cure the declared invalidity of this chapter;
(3) Upon the date of the declaration and proposal, the Borough Council
shall not be required to entertain or consider any curative
amendment filed by a landowner. Nor shall the Zoning Hearing
Board be required to give a report, upon request, for a challenge to
the validity of this chapter subsequent to the declaration and
proposal, based upon the grounds identical to or substantially
similar to those specified in the resolution required by this section.
Upon the enactment of a curative amendment to, or the
reaffirmation of the validity of this chapter, no rights to a cure by
amendment or challenge shall, from the date of the declaration and
proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive
invalidity of the unamended chapter for which the Borough Council
proposes to prepare a curative amendment; and
(4) The Borough Council, having utilized the procedures as set forth in
this section, may not again utilize said procedures for a thirty-sixmonth
period following the date of the enactment of a curative
amendment, or reaffirmation of the validity of this chapter;
provided, however, that if after the date of declaration and
proposal, there is a substantially new duty or obligation imposed
upon the Borough by virtue of a decision by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the Borough Council may utilize the provisions of this
section to prepare a curative amendment to this chapter to fulfill
this duty or obligation.

§ 260-233. Zoning Hearing Board.
H. Authentication of Official Zoning Map. Whenever there has been a
change in the boundary of a zone or a reclassification of the zone
adopted in accordance with the above, the change on the Official
Zoning Map shall be made, and shall be duly certified by the Borough
Secretary and shall thereafter be refiled as part of the permanent
records of Borough.
A. Establishment and membership. There shall be a Zoning Hearing Board
which shall consist of three members who shall be appointed by
resolution by the Borough Council. The membership of the Zoning
Hearing Board shall consist of residents of the Borough. Their terms of
office shall be three years and shall be so fixed that the term of office of
one member shall expire each year. The Zoning Hearing Board shall
promptly notify the Borough Council of any vacancies which occur.
Appointments to fill vacancies shall hold no other office in the Borough.
Any member of the Zoning Hearing Board may be removed for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office or for other just
cause by a majority vote of the Borough Council taken after the member
has received 15 days' advance notice of the intent to take such a vote. A
hearing shall be held in connection with the vote if the member shall
request it in writing. The Borough Council may appoint by resolution at
least one but no more than three residents of the Borough of
Middletown to serve as alternate members of the Zoning Hearing
Board. The term of office of an alternate member shall be three years.
When seated pursuant to the provisions of this section, an alternate
shall be entitled to participate in all proceedings and discussions of the
Zoning Hearing Board to the same and full extent as provided by law for
Zoning Hearing Board members, including specifically the right to cast
a vote as a voting member during the proceedings, and shall have all
the powers and duties set forth in this chapter and as otherwise
provided by law. Alternates shall hold no other office in the Borough,
including membership on the Planning Committee and Zoning Officer.
Any alternate may participate in any proceeding or discussion of the
Zoning Hearing Board but shall not be entitled to vote as a member of
the Zoning Hearing Board nor be compensated, unless designated as a
voting alternate member pursuant to this article.
B. Organization of Zoning Hearing Board. The Zoning Hearing Board shall
elect from its own membership its officers, who shall serve annual
terms as such and may succeed themselves. For the conduct of any
hearing and the taking of any action, a quorum shall be not less than a
majority of all members of the Zoning Hearing Board, but the Zoning
Hearing Board may appoint a hearing officer from its own membership
to conduct any hearing on its behalf and the parties may waive further
action by the Zoning Hearing Board as provided in § 260-233D(2). If, by
reason of absence or disqualification of a member, a quorum is not
reached, the Chairman of the Zoning Hearing Board shall designate as
many alternate members of the Zoning Hearing Board to sit on the
§ 260-232 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-233
1:795
Zoning Hearing Board as may be needed to provide a quorum. Any
alternate member of the Zoning Hearing Board shall continue to serve
on the Zoning Hearing Board in all proceedings involving the matter
or case for which the alternate was initially appointed until the Zoning
Hearing Board has made a final determination of the matter or case.
Designation of an alternate pursuant to this section shall be made on
a case-by-case basis in rotation according to declining seniority among
all alternates. The Zoning Hearing Board may make, alter, and rescind
rules and forms for its procedure, consistent with ordinances of the
Borough and laws of the commonwealth. The Zoning Hearing Board
shall keep full public records of its business, which records shall be the
property of the Borough, and shall submit a report of its activities to the
Borough Council upon request.
C. Expenditures for services. Within the limits of funds appropriated by
the Borough Council, the Zoning Hearing Board may employ or
contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other
technical and clerical services. Members of the Zoning Hearing Board
may receive compensation for the performance of their duties, as may
be fixed by the Borough Council. Alternate members of the Zoning
Hearing Board may receive compensation, as may be fixed by the
Borough Council, for the performance of their duties when designated
as alternate members pursuant to § 260-233A, but in no case shall such
compensation exceed the rate of compensation authorized to be paid to
the members by the Borough Council.
D. Hearings.
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board shall conduct hearings and make
decisions in accordance with the following requirements:
(a) Public notice, as defined herein, shall be provided. In addition,

presentation of their opposition to the application within 100
days of the first hearing held after the completion of the
applicant's case-in-chief. An applicant may, upon request, be
granted additional hearings to complete its case-in-chief,
provided the persons opposed to the application are granted an
equal number of additional hearings to complete their
opposition to the application, provided the applicant is granted
an equal number of additional hearings for rebuttal.
(2) The hearings shall be conducted by the Zoning Hearing Board or
the Zoning Hearing Board may appoint any member or an
independent attorney as a hearing officer. The decision, or, where
no decision is called for, the findings shall be made by the Zoning

hearing, waive decisions or findings by the Zoning Hearing Board
and accept the decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
(3) The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person
affected by the application who has made timely appearance of
record before the Zoning Hearing Board, and any other person,
including civic or community organizations permitted to appear by

(7) The Zoning Hearing Board or the hearing officer, as the case may
be, shall keep a stenographic record of the proceedings. The
appearance fee for a stenographer shall be shared equally by the
applicant and the Zoning Hearing Board. The cost of the original
transcript shall be paid by the Zoning Hearing Board if the
transcript is ordered by the Zoning Hearing Board or hearing
officer, or shall be paid by the person appealing the decision of the
Zoning Hearing Board if such appeal is made, and in either event,

materials, except advice from their solicitor, unless the parties are
afforded an opportunity to contest the materials so noticed and
shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after the
commencement of hearings with any party or his representative
unless all parties are given an opportunity to be present.
(9) The Zoning Hearing Board or the hearing officer, as the case may
be, shall render a written decision or, when no decision is called for,
make written findings on the application within 45 days after the
last hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board or hearing officer.
Where the application is contested or denied, each decision shall be
accompanied by the findings of fact and conclusions based thereon
together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any
provisions of this or of any ordinance, rule or regulation shall
contain a reference to the provision relied on and the reasons why
the conclusion is deemed appropriate in light of the facts found. If
the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, and there has been no
stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall make his report and recommendations
available to the parties within 45 days and the parties shall be
entitled to make written representations thereon to the Zoning
Hearing Board prior to final decision or entry of findings, and the
Zoning Hearing Board's decision shall be entered no later than 30
days after the report of the hearing officer. Except for challenges
filed under Article IX of the MPC,211 where the Zoning Hearing
Board fails to render the decision within the period required by this
211. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10901 through 10918.
§ 260-233 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 260-233
1:798
subsection or fails to commence, conduct or complete the required
hearing as provided in § 260-233D of this chapter, the decision
shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant
unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an
extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of
the applicant because of the failure of the Zoning Hearing Board
to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall give public notice of said decision with 10 days
from the last day it could have met to render a decision in the same
manner as provided in § 260-233D of this chapter. If the Zoning
Hearing Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may
do so. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any
party opposing the application to appeal.
(10) A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the
findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to
him not later than the next business day following its date. To all
other persons who have filed their name and address with the
Zoning Hearing Board not later than the last day of the hearing, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall provide by mail or otherwise, brief
notice of the decision or findings and a statement of the place at
which the full decision or findings may be examined.
(11) Effect of Zoning Hearing Board's decision.
(a) If the variance or special exception is granted or the issuance
of a permit is approved, or other action by the appellant is
authorized, the necessary permit shall be secured and the
authorized action begun within two years after the date when
the variance or special exception is finally granted, or the
issuance of a permit is finally approved, or the other action by
the appellant is authorized, and the building or alteration, as
the case may be, shall be completed within three years of said
date. For good cause, the Zoning Hearing Board may at any
time, upon application in writing, extend either of these
deadlines;
(b) Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary
permits within said two-year period, or having obtained the
permit, should he fail to commence work thereunder within
such two-year period, it shall be conclusively presumed that
the appellant or applicant has waived, withdrawn, or
abandoned his appeal or his application, and all provisions,
variances and permits granted to him shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by the Zoning Hearing Board;
(c) Should the appellant or applicant commence construction or
alteration within said two-year period, but should he fail to
complete such construction or alteration within said three-year
period, the Zoning Hearing Board may, upon 10 days' notice, in
writing, rescind or revoke the granted variance or special
§ 260-233 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-233
1:799
exception, or the issuance of the permit, or permits, or the
other action authorized to the appellant or applicant, if the
Zoning Hearing Board finds that no good cause appears for
the failure to complete within such three-year period, and if
the Zoning Hearing Board further finds that conditions have
so altered or changed in the interval since the granting of the
variance, permit or action, that revocation or rescission of the
action is justified; and
(d) As an alternative to the preceding, an applicant can request, as
part of the original application before the Zoning Hearing
Board, the granting of a timetable associated with the request
which would supersede the deadlines imposed. In so doing, the
applicant must demonstrate that the times requested are
logically related to normal and expected progress of the
project. In approving a timetable under this section, the Zoning
Hearing Board must establish and bind a definite time frame
for issuance of a zoning permit, and completion of construction
of the project.
E. Zoning Hearing Board's functions. The Zoning Hearing Board shall
have the exclusive jurisdiction to hear and render decisions in the
following matters:
(1) Substantive challenges to the validity of this chapter, except those
brought before the Borough Council pursuant to Section
916.1(a)(2) of the MPC.212
(a) If a challenge heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to
have merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall
include recommended amendments to the challenged
ordinance which will cure the defects found. In reaching its
decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the
amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:
[1] The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities,
water supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
[2] If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the
effectiveness of the proposal in providing housing units of
a type actually available to and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged
provisions of this chapter or Zoning Map;
[3] The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed
by the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands,
floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural
features;
212. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.1(a)(2).
§ 260-233 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 260-233
1:800
[4] The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
nature features, the degree to which these are protected
or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to
development and any adverse environmental impacts; and
[5] The impact of the proposal on the preservation of
agriculture and other land uses which are essential to
public health and welfare.
(b) Public notice of the hearing shall be provided as specified in
§ 260-233D of this chapter.
(c) The Zoning Hearing Board shall commence its hearings within
60 days after the request is filed unless the landowner requests
or consents to an extension of time.
(d) The Zoning Hearing Board shall render its decision with 45
days after the conclusion of the last hearing. If the Board fails
to act on the landowner's request within this time limit, a
denial of the request is deemed to have occurred on the 46th
day after the close of the last hearing.
(2) Challenges to the validity of this chapter, raising procedural
questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or
adoption which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken
within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter.
(3) Special exceptions as provided for in this chapter and subject to all
applicable requirements, including, but not limited to:
(a) Filing requirements. In addition to the required zoning permit
information, each special exception application shall include
the following:
[1] Ground floor plans and elevations for proposed structures;
[2] Names and addresses of adjoining property owners,
including properties directly across a public right-of-way;
[3] A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient
detail and accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all
applicable provisions of this chapter; and
[4] A written description of the proposed use in sufficient
detail to demonstrate compliance with all applicable
provisions of this chapter.
(b) General criteria. Each applicant must demonstrate compliance
with the following:
[1] The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and
intent of this chapter;
§ 260-233 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-233
1:801
[2] The proposed use shall not detract from the use and
enjoyment of adjoining or nearby properties;
[3] The proposed use will not substantially change the
character of the subject property's neighborhood;
[4] Adequate public facilities are available to serve the
proposed use (e.g., schools, fire, police and ambulance
protection, sewer, water and other utilities, vehicular
access, etc.);
[5] The proposed use complies with the Borough Floodplain
Ordinance;213
[6] The proposed use shall comply with those criteria
specifically listed in Article XVIII of this chapter. In
addition, the proposed use must comply with all other
applicable regulations contained in this chapter; and
[7] The proposed use will not substantially impair the integrity
of the Borough of Middletown Comprehensive Plan.
(c) Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board, in approving special
exception applications, may attach conditions considered
necessary to protect the public welfare and the purposes listed
above, including conditions which are more restrictive than
those established for other uses in the same zone. The
conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer and
failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.
(d) Site plan approval. Any site plan presented in support of the
special exception pursuant to § 260-233E(3) shall become an
official part of the record for said special exception. Approval
of any special exception will also bind the use in accordance
with the submitted site plan; therefore, should a change in the
site plan be required as part of the approval of the use, the
applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the issuance of a
zoning permit. Any subsequent change to the use on the
subject property not reflected on the originally approved site
plan, shall require the obtainment of another special exception
approval.
(4) Variances. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for
variances where it is alleged that the provisions of this chapter
inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Zoning
Hearing Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of application to the
Zoning Officer. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance,
provided that all of the following findings are made where relevant
in a given case:
213. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 158, Flood Damage Prevention.
§ 260-233 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 260-233
1:802
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or zone in which
the property is located;
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is not a possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
reasonable use of the property;
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the zone or neighborhood in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare;
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulations in issue;
(f) The proposed use complies with the Borough Floodplain
Ordinance;214
(g) In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer
and failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a
violation of this chapter;
(h) Filing requirements. In addition to the required zoning permit,
each variance application shall include the following:
[1] Ground floor plans and elevations of existing and/or
proposed structures;
[2] Names and addresses of adjoining property owners,
including properties directly across a public right-of-way;
[3] A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient
detail and accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all
applicable provisions of this chapter; and
214. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 158, Flood Damage Prevention.
§ 260-233 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-233
1:803
[4] A written description of the proposed use in sufficient
detail to demonstrate compliance with all applicable
provisions of this chapter;
(i) Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board, in approving variance
applications, may attach conditions considered necessary to
protect the public welfare and the purposes listed above,
including conditions which are more restrictive than those
established for other uses in the same zone. These conditions
shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer and failure to
comply with such conditions will constitute a violation of this
chapter; and
(j) Site plan approval. Any site plan presented in support of a
variance shall become an official part of the record for said
variance. Approval of any variance will also bind the use in
accordance with the submitted site plan.
(5) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including,
but not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to
act on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease-and-desist
order or the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming
use, structure or lot.
(6) Appeals from the determination of any officer or agency charged
with the administration of any transfers of development rights or
performance density provisions of this chapter.
(7) Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination under Section
916.2 (and any subsequent amendments) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.215
(8) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Municipal
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance with
reference to sedimentation and erosion control, and/or stormwater
management for applications not involving a subdivision/land
development, nor a planned residential development as regulated
in Article V and VII of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code.216
F. Parties appellant before the Zoning Hearing Board. Appeals under
§§ 260-233E(4)(d), (e), (f), (g) and (h), and proceedings to challenge this
chapter under § 260-233E, may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board,
in writing, by the landowner affected, any officer or agency of the
Borough of Middletown, or any person aggrieved. Requests for a
variance or a special exception may be filed with the Zoning Hearing
Board by any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such
landowner. Any appeal shall state:
215. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
216. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10501 through 10516 and 10701 through 10713, respectively.
§ 260-233 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 260-233
1:804
(1) The name and address of the appellant and applicant;
(2) The name and address of the landowner of the real estate to be
affected;
(3) A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected by
such proposed change, together with a plot plan drawn to scale
with sufficient clarity to show the nature and character of the
request;
(4) A statement of the present zoning classification of the real estate in
question, the improvements thereon, and the present use thereof;
and
(5) A statement of the section of this chapter under which the request
may be allowed, and reasons why it should or should not be
granted.
G. Time limitations.
(1) No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been approved by the
Zoning Officer or the agency responsible for granting such
approval if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to
limit the approval in any manner unless such person alleges and
proves that he had no notice or knowledge, or reason to believe
that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to
his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the
knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
(2) The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision by the Zoning Officer a challenge to the validity of
this chapter or the Official Zoning Map pursuant to Section 916.2 of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,217 as amended,
shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except in the case
where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved tentative preliminary approval.
H. Stay of proceeding.
(1) Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Subsection F, above,
and during its pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board, all land
development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or
approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and all
official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer
or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Zoning
Hearing Board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case, the development
or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining
217. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
§ 260-233 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-233

§ 260-234. Conditional uses.
order, which may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or by
the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after
notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body.
When an application for development, preliminary or final, has
been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit
the approval are filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by person
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such person to post
bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before the
Zoning Hearing Board. After the petition is presented, the court
shall hold a hearing to determine if the filing of the appeal is
frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits
of the case. It shall be the burden of the applicant for a bond to
prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all evidence
presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous,
it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the
court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by the
appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court. The question whether or
not such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond
shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying
a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing the
responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
(2) If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from
an order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post
a bond and the appellant court sustains the order of the court
below to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond,
upon motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable
costs, expenses, and attorney's fees incurred by the petitioner.
I. Appeal. Any person, taxpayer, or the Borough aggrieved by any decision
of the Zoning Hearing Board may within 30 days after such decision of
the Zoning Hearing Board, seek review by the Court of Common Pleas
of such decision in the manner provided by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code,218 as amended.
A. Filing of conditional use. For any use permitted by conditional use, a
conditional use must be obtained from the Borough Council. In addition
to the information required on the zoning permit application, the
conditional use application must show:
(1) Ground floor plans and elevations of proposed structures;
218. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 260-233 MIDDLETOWN CODE § 260-234
1:806
(2) Names and addresses of adjoining property owners, including
properties directly across a public right-of-way;
(3) A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient detail and
accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions
of this chapter.
B. General criteria. Each applicant must demonstrate compliance with the
following:
(1) The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of
this chapter;
(2) The proposed use shall not detract from the use and enjoyment of
adjoining or nearby properties;
(3) The proposed use will not effect a change in the character of the
subject property's neighborhood;
(4) Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed use
(e.g., schools, fire, police and ambulance protection, sewer, water,
and other utilities, vehicular access, etc.);
(5) The proposed use complies with the Borough Floodplain
Ordinance;219
(6) The proposed use shall comply with those criteria specifically listed
in Article XVIII of this chapter. In addition, the proposed use must
comply with all other applicable regulations of this chapter; and
(7) The proposed use will not substantially impair the integrity of the
Borough of Middletown's Comprehensive Plan;
C. Conditions. The Borough Council, in approving conditional use
applications, may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the
public welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions
which are more restrictive than those established for other uses in the
same zone. These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer
and failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
D. Site plan approval. Any site plan presented in support of the conditional
use shall become an official part of the record for said conditional use.
Approval of any conditional use will also bind the use in accordance
with the submitted site plan; therefore, should a change in the site plan
be required as part of the approval of the use, the applicant shall revise
the site plan prior to the issuance of a zoning permit. Any subsequent
change to the use on the subject property not reflected on the originally
approved site plan shall require the obtainment of another conditional
use approval.

appeal is made, and in either event, the cost of additional copies
shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other
cases, the party requesting the original transcript shall bear the
cost thereof.
(9) The Borough Council shall not communicate, directly or indirectly,
with any party or his representatives in connection with any issue
involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to
participate, shall not take notice of any communication, reports,
staff memoranda, or other materials, except advice from their
solicitor, unless parties are afforded an opportunity to contest the
material so noticed and shall not inspect the site or its
surroundings after the commencement of hearings with any party
or his representative unless all parties are given an opportunity to
be present.
(10) The hearing shall be conducted by the Borough Council or the
Borough Council may appoint any member or an independent
attorney as a hearing officer. The decision, or where there is no
decision, the findings shall be made by the Borough Council.
However, the appellant or the applicant, as the case may be, in
addition to the Borough may, prior to the decision of the hearing,
waive decision or findings by the Borough Council and accept the
decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
(11) The Borough Council shall render a written decision or, when no
decision is called for, make written finds on the conditional use
application within 45 days after the last hearing before the
Borough Council. Where the application is contested or denied,
each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact or
conclusions based thereon, together with any reasons therefor.
Conclusions based on any provisions of this chapter or of any
ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the
provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed
appropriate in the light of the facts found.
(12) Where the Borough Council fails to render the decision within the
period required by this article or fails to commence, conduct or
complete the required hearing as provided in this chapter, the
decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the
applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the
record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered
§ 260-234 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-234
1:809
in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Borough
Council to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the
Borough Council shall give public notice of the decision within 10
days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in the
same manner as required by the public notice requirements of this
article. If the Borough Council shall fail to provide such notice, the
applicant may do so.
F. Time limitation.
(1) If a conditional use is granted, the necessary permit shall be
secured and the authorized action begun within two years after the
date when the conditional use is finally granted, and the building or
alteration, as the case may be, shall be completed within three
years of said date. For good cause, the Borough Council may at any
time, upon application in writing, extend either of these deadlines;
(2) Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary
permits within said two-year period, or having obtained the permit
should he fail to commence work thereunder within such two-year
period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the appellant or
applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned his application,
and all approvals and permits granted to him shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by the Borough Council;
(3) Should the appellant commence construction or alteration within
said two-year period, but should he fail to complete such
construction or alteration within said three-year period, the
Borough Council may, upon 10 days' notice, in writing, rescind or
revoke the granted conditional use, if the Borough Council finds
that no good cause appears for the failure to complete within such
three-year period, and if the Borough Council further finds that
conditions have altered or changed in the interval since the
granting of the conditional use that revocation or rescission of the
action is justified; and
(4) As an alternative to the preceding, an applicant can request, as
part of the original application before the Borough Council the
granting of a timetable associated with the request which would
supersede the deadlines imposed in this article. In so doing, the
applicant must demonstrate that the times requested are logically
related to normal and expected progress of the project. In
approving a timetable under this section, the Borough Council must
establish and bind a definite time frame for issuance of a zoning
permit, and completion of construction of the project.

and place the applicant should report for examination.
(3) Only applicants receiving notices to report for any examination

accordance with the instructions contained in the written notice
shall disqualify the applicant; except in the case of a medical
examination, the applicant, with the prior approval of the medical

A. Introduction. The Borough is aware of both the requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Pennsylvania Human
Relations Act (PHRA),223 and its need to protect the health, safety and
welfare of its citizens through the continuous efforts of its Police
Department. As a result, the Borough requests that candidates for
positions make any need for reasonable accommodation known to the
Borough at the time of the application and medical/psychological
examination.
B. Medical and mental requirements. Every applicant to whom the
Borough has made a conditional job offer for appointment to a position
in the Police Department shall submit, at Borough expense, to a medical
examination by a Borough-appointed examiner, who shall determine if
the applicant is free from any bodily or mental defect, deformity or
disease that might make it impossible for that candidate to perform his/
her essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation.
C. Report of examiner. The Commission shall furnish each applicant with
forms upon which the medical examiner shall state the physical and/or
mental condition of each applicant. The report of each examination
shall be submitted to the Commission within five days after the date of
examination.
D. Rejection of applicants. If the examiner shall deem any applicant
medically unfit for performance of the essential duties of a police officer
because of any physical or mental defect, which cannot be reasonably
accommodated, whether or not the defect shall be specifically stated as
a cause for rejection in the statement of medical requirements, such
applicant shall be rejected and a brief statement of the reason for
rejection shall be entered in the report of the medical examination.
Insofar as possible, however, the medical examiner shall determine the
medical fitness of an applicant after reviewing the job descriptions and
its essential job functions and mental and physical requirements. The
medical examiner shall discuss any request for reasonable

§ A265-7. Examinations.
accommodation with the Borough Manager and Chief of Police prior to
making final determination.
E. Reexamination of medical fitness. Each applicant eligible for
certification to the Borough Council for appointment to any position in
the Police Department shall be instructed by the Assistant Borough
Manager, before being certified, to inform the Commission of any
illness or injuries requiring the attendance of a physician or requiring
hospitalization, rehabilitation or outpatient treatment, and of any
surgical operations that shall have occurred subsequent to the original
medical examination. If, in the judgment of the Commission, there has
been any change which is contrary to what was reported by the
applicant, whether or not such change has been reported, the
Commission may require the applicant to submit to a further medical
and/or psychological examination before being certified for
appointment. Any such further examination(s) shall be performed at the
expense of the Borough, conducted by a Borough-appointed examiner.
F. Employee medical examination. When, in the opinion of the
Commission or Borough Council, an employee is physically or mentally
incapable of performing the essential duties of his/her position, the
Commission or Council may require the employee in question to submit
to a medical and/or psychological examination by an examiner
appointed by the Commission. At that time, the employee is urged to
make recommendations regarding any desired reasonable
accommodation in order to begin the interactive exchange process. If
after consideration of such reasonable accommodation, the Borough
still believes that the employee cannot perform the essential functions
of his/her job, written findings shall be made. The written findings of
such examiner or examiners may be deemed a just basis for discharge
due to disability. Dismissals because of physical and/or mental disability
shall be made in accordance with § A265-11 of these rules.
A. Entry level examinations for police officer.
(1) Entry-level written examinations for police officers shall be
conducted either by the Dauphin County Chiefs of Police
Association, Inc., and the results of such shall be submitted to the
Commission, or by the Commission or its designee if the
Commission elects to administer either the written or agility tests.
[Amended 5-8-2019 by Ord. No. 1362, approved 5-8-2019]
(2) Test scoring. Testing shall include:
(a) Successful completion of a physical fitness assessment
conducted on a pass/fail basis. Candidates who do not
successfully complete this test will not be admitted to the
written examination.
§ A265-6 MIDDLETOWN CODE § A265-7
1:820
(b) A score of 70% or more on a written examination;
(c) An oral examination which is considered 30% of the final score
(the written is weighted as 70%).
B. Examination for ranks above the position of police officer and below the
rank of Chief of Police.
(1) An examination for the above positions shall consist of three parts,
namely:
(a) A written examination which shall include a test of police
knowledge, supervision and performance and such other
written tests as the Commission may, from time to time,
designate. The written examination shall represent 60% of all
examinations.
(b) An oral examination which represents 40% of all examinations.
(c) The total of all examinations shall not exceed 100%.
(d) If deemed necessary and/or desirable, psychological
assessments, physical assessments and agility tests may be
administered. (Pass/fail scored only.)
(2) So far as they are able, the Commission shall provide that the
written portion of the examination for the varying ranks shall place
emphasis upon those qualifications which are important in each
rank. In every case, however, the total weight assigned to the
written examination shall be a total of 60%.
C. Passing grades.
(1) The minimum passing grade for an examination and to be eligible
to proceed to the next examination for the position of police officer
shall be a score of 70%. The minimum passing grade for any
examination for positions above the rank of police officer and to be
able to proceed to the next examination shall be a score of 80%.
(2) Every applicant for the position of police officer who receives a
total score of at least 70%, after weighting the written and oral
exams, and who is entitled by law to additional credit for service in
the Armed Forces of the United States, shall have his/her score
adjusted accordingly as provided by law. Applicants claiming
veteran's preference shall submit satisfactory proof of active
service and honorable discharge.
D. Notice of applicant's grade. When the grading of each examination is
completed, the Secretary shall give each applicant written notice of his/
her grade. A copy of the eligibility list which lists the passing scores
shall be posted in the Municipal Building listing the applicant's name
and grade.
§ A265-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A265-7
1:821
E. Administering examinations. The Commission may designate the
Dauphin County Chiefs of Police Association, Inc., to perform entrylevel
testing. The Commission may designate the Department of
Community and Economic Development, Governor's Center for Local
Government Services, the Commission of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, a consulting company or any other recognized examining
agency to act as examiner for the written examinations. If the
Commission elects to perform its own testing, the Commission or its
designee shall be responsible for administering the written or the
agility tests. The oral examination of any applicant shall be the
responsibility of the Commission, provided that the Commission may
designate, from time to time, such persons qualified in oral examination
techniques and procedures or qualified to evaluate performance or
service records as considered necessary to assist in such examinations
and evaluations. [Amended 5-8-2019 by Ord. No. 1362, approved
5-8-2019]
F. Conduct of written examination.
(1) The Commission and/or its testing agent shall prepare a statement
of instructions and rules for the conduct of written examinations.
(2) A blind system for scoring examinations will be used. The
candidate's test number and name is placed on a card and sealed in
an envelope until the test scores are calculated. Later, the test
number is matched to the candidate's name.
G. Penalty for improper conduct. Should an applicant for a entry level
position be found guilty of an act tending to defeat the proper conduct
or the result of any examination, his/her name shall be removed from
the eligible list resulting from the examination, and the applicant shall
not be permitted to make future application for any position in the
Police Department or Borough. Should any member of the Borough of
Middletown Police Department be found guilty of an act tending to
defeat the proper conduct on the result of any examination, his or her
name shall be referred to the Mayor for appropriate action.
H. Examination for Chief of Police. The Commission may certify a
candidate to the position of Chief of Police who meets the qualifications
specified in § A265-4G by one of the following options as selected by
Borough Council.
(1) A noncompetitive process. The Council nominates a candidate for
the position to the Commission at which time the Commission
administers a noncompetitive examination to the candidate. The
examination must test the candidate's knowledge of police
management and administration. If the candidate passes the
examination by a score of 80% or higher, the Commission may
certify the candidate to the position of Police Chief; or
§ A265-7 MIDDLETOWN CODE § A265-7
1:822
§ A265-8. Eligible list.
(2) A competitive process. Commission or designate, or Borough
Council or designate, may minimally administer written and oral
examinations to test the candidates' knowledge of police
management and administration. To be considered, the candidate
must pass all the requirements for police officer and any additional
requirements imposed by the Commission for Police Chief.
I. The Commission may refuse to examine, or, if examined, may refuse to
certify after examination as eligible, any applicant who: [Added
5-8-2019 by Ord. No. 1362, approved 5-8-2019]
(1) Is found to lack any of the minimum qualifications for examination
prescribed in the rules and regulations adopted for the position or
employment for which the applicant has applied;
(2) Is physically unfit for the performance of the duties of the position
to which the applicant seeks employment;
(3) Is illegally using a controlled substance, as defined in Section 102
of the Controlled Substances Act (91-513, 21 U.S.C.A. § 802);
(4) Has been guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude or of
infamous or notoriously disgraceful conduct;
(5) Has been dismissed from public service for delinquency or
misconduct of office; or
(6) Is affiliated with any group whose policies or activities are
subversive to the form of government enumerated in the
Constitutions and laws of the United States and this
Commonwealth.
J. If an applicant is aggrieved by the refusal of the Commission to certify
the applicant as eligible after examination or a person is aggrieved by
refusal of the Commission to examine the person, the Commission shall,
at the request of the applicant or person aggrieved, within 10 days,
appoint a time and place for a public hearing. At the hearing, the
applicant or person aggrieved may appear with or without counsel, and
the Commission shall take testimony and review its refusal to provide
examination or certification. The deliberations of the Commission,
including interim rulings on evidentiary or procedural issues, may be
held in the nature of a closed executive session. The Commission's
disposition of the matter shall constitute official action which shall
occur at a public meeting held under 65 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 7 (relating to
open meetings). The decision of the Commission shall be final. [Added
5-8-2019 by Ord. No. 1362, approved 5-8-2019]
A. Preparation of eligible list. As soon as possible after the completion of
all examinations other than entry level, the Secretary shall prepare an
eligible list upon which shall appear the name of each applicant who
§ A265-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A265-8
1:823
§ A265-9. Certification and appointments.
has successfully completed the examination process. The names on the
eligible list shall be arranged, from the highest to the lowest, in the
order of the final weighted score received by each eligible applicant.
The eligible list shall be filed in the office of the Assistant Borough
Manager and a copy shall be posted on the bulletin board in the
Borough Municipal Building.
B. Breaking tie scores. When two or more eligible applicants shall receive
the same final weighted score, the order in which the names of such
persons shall appear on the eligible list shall be determined by their
respective scores on that part of the examination assigned the greatest
weight. In the event that two or more qualifying applicants also receive
identical scores on that part of the examination assigned the greatest
weight, the order of listing shall be determined by the order in which
the applications were numbered for recording purposes.
C. Life of eligible lists. The eligibility list will be valid for one year from the
date the Commission formally adopts the eligibility list. Prior to
expiration of the one-year period, the Commission may extend the
validity of the eligibility list for up to an additional 12 months by a
majority vote of the Commission at a duly authorized Commission
meeting. In the absence of a lawful extension by the Commission, the
list shall expire. [Amended 5-8-2019 by Ord. No. 1362, approved
5-8-2019]
D. Furlough lists. Whenever the Borough Council shall determine the need
for a reduction in the number of police officers, the Commission shall
prepare and maintain a list of the names of all such furloughed officers,
together with the position held by each such officer at the time of
furlough. The names on the furlough list shall be arranged in priority
order based on seniority of each furloughed officer. Seniority shall be
defined by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
A. The Council shall notify the Commission of any vacancy which is to be
filled and shall request the certification of an eligibility list. The
Commission shall certify for each existing vacancy from the eligibility
list the names of the three persons, or a lesser number if three are not
available, who have received the highest average. The Council shall
make a conditional appointment from the three names certified, based
solely on the merits and fitness of the candidates, unless Council makes
objections to the Commission regarding one or more of the certified
persons for any of the reasons stated in § A265-7I and J (relating to
rejection of applicant and hearing). If the objections are sustained by
the Commission as provided in § A265-7I and J or the conditional
appointee is determined to be unqualified in accordance with the
procedures specified in § A265-7I and J, the Commission shall strike the
name of the person from the eligibility list and certify the next highest
name for each name stricken from the eligibility list. As each
subsequent vacancy occurs in the same or another position, the same
§ A265-8 MIDDLETOWN CODE § A265-9
1:824
procedure shall be followed. [Amended 5-8-2019 by Ord. No. 1362,
approved 5-8-2019]
B. Furlough list to fill appointments. Upon receipt of a request from the
Borough Council, the Commission shall first certify the names of those
eligible applicants who were furloughed because of a reduction in the
force. In filling a vacancy from furlough lists, the Commission shall
certify the top name only. If more than one vacancy is to be filled, the
Commission shall certify the number of names equal to the number of
vacancies by the order of the list, highest to lowest.
C. Certification from eligible lists. If no furlough list exists, or if the total
number of vacancies cannot be filled from the available names on the
furlough list, the Commission shall certify names from the eligible list.
The number of available names certified from the eligible list shall
exceed by two the number of vacancies to be filled from such eligible
list. If there are less than three available eligibles on the eligible list,
the Borough Council shall request that the Commission or the Dauphin
County Chiefs of Police Association, Inc., hold another examination.
D. Removal of names from furlough and eligible lists.
(1) In addition to the other reasons stated as grounds for removal in
these rules, the name of any person appearing on a furlough list or
an eligible list shall be removed by the Commission if such person:
(a) Is appointed to a position in the Police Department;
(b) Declines an appointment to a permanent position in the Police
Department;
(c) Fails to make written reply to the Commission within 14
calendar days from the mailing of a certified letter for the
position offered; or
(d) Indicates availability for appointment and is appointed to fill a
vacancy but fails to report for duty at the time prescribed,
unless, in the opinion of the Commission, such person can
show good and sufficient reasons for failure to report.
(2) Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed as authorizing
the removal of the name of a person from a furlough list or eligible
list who refuses or accepts a position of a lower rank than that from
which furloughed or for which eligible on a Commission list.
E. Appointment procedures. Whenever the name of a person is certified
from either the furlough list or the eligible list, a notarized statement of
waiver shall be obtained from the candidate to permit a comprehensive
background check. Upon the completion of a background check,
including the FCRA, indicating an acceptable background, the person
shall be notified immediately of such certification by registered or
certified mail. The notice shall include the title of the position the
§ A265-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A265-9
1:825
§ A265-10. Promotions.
compensation to be paid and shall request a written reply within 14
days from the date of mailing.
F. Probationary period. All initial appointments to positions in the Police
Department shall be for a probationary period of one year. The Chief of
Police shall investigate the adjustment, performance and general
acceptability of each probationer to determine whether such
probationer is fully qualified for permanent appointment. The Chief of
Police shall make a report on the performance and conduct of each
probationer at the end of the fourth and eighth months of the
probationary period and, finally, not less than 15 calendar days before
the next regular meeting of the Borough Council immediately preceding
the end of the probationary period. Each final probationary report shall
include the recommendation of the Chief of Police either to retain or
reject the probationer. Each report shall be submitted in writing to the
Mayor for presentation to the Borough Council within 15 days prior to
the regular meeting of the Borough Council immediately preceding the
end of the probationary period. The Borough Council shall notify the
Commission and shall notify the probationer of such decision on or
before the last day of the probationary period. In the event the
probationary appointment is the Chief of Police, the Mayor shall
evaluate the performance and conduct of the Chief in the same manner
and subject to the same procedures as all other positions, by providing
a written report to Borough Council.
G. Provisional appointments. Whenever there are urgent reasons for the
filling of a vacancy in any position in the police force and there are no
names on the eligible list for such appointment, Council may nominate a
person to the Commission for noncompetitive examination and if such
nominee shall be certified by the Commission as qualified after such
noncompetitive examination, he/she may be appointed provisionally to
fill such vacancy. It shall thereupon become the duty of the Commission
within three weeks to request an examination from the Dauphin County
Chiefs of Police Association, Inc., and/or other authorized testing agent
to hold a competitive examination and certify a list of eligible's and
regular appointment shall then be made from the name or names
submitted by the Commission.
H. Notification. It shall be the duty of the Council to notify any provisional
appointee in writing at the time of appointment concerning the terms
and tenure of such appointment as provided by law and to receive his/
her written acknowledgement of such notice.
A. Promotions. Promotions shall be based on examinations. The nature
and scope of which shall be determined by the Commission and shall be
in concert with the applicable sections of § A265-7 of these rules.
B. Examinations. Promotional examinations shall be conducted by the
Commission and an eligible list drawn up in the same manner as that
§ A265-9 MIDDLETOWN CODE § A265-10
1:826
§ A265-11. Suspensions, removals and reductions in rank.
prescribed for original appointment, provided that only the names of
those participants in a promotional examination who shall have
attained a final average rating of 80% shall be placed on the resultant
eligible list for promotional appointment. In response to requisition for
names to fill a position by promotion, the Commission shall certify the
entire appropriate eligible list and the appointing officer or body shall
have the right to appoint any person whose name appears on the said
list.
C. Deputy Chief duties. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Mayor or
the Police Chief from adding additional functions, responsibilities and/
or compensation to an officer or other police employee covered by these
regulations without an examination and promotion. Conversely,
removal of such additional functions, responsibilities and/or
compensation shall not be considered a suspension, removal or
reduction in rank for purposes of § A265-11.
A. Procedures.
(1) Whenever a police officer is suspended without pay, removed or
reduced in rank, the specific charges warranting such actions shall
be stated in writing by the Mayor and relayed to the police officer
by the Commission. The charges shall be stated clearly and in
sufficient detail to enable the officer to understand the charges and
to allow the officer an opportunity to respond to those charges. The
charges shall specify that which provides the basis for the
disciplinary action as well as an explanation of the factual
circumstances upon which the appointing authority relied in
finding a violation.
(2) Within five days after the Mayor has imposed the suspension,
removal or reduction in rank, a written statement of the charges
shall be delivered to the officer either by personal service or by
certified and registered mail. A copy of the statement of charges
shall also be served upon the members of the Civil Service
Commission.
B. Demand of hearing. Any police officer suspended, removed or reduced
in rank may file with the Commission a written demand for a formal
hearing with a taped or stenographic record, and right to examination
and cross-examination. Such written demand and any statement of
written answers to the charges made against the person accused shall
be filed no later than 10 calendar days from the date upon which the
statement of charges were personally serviced or received. Each such
hearing shall be open to the public.
C. Hearing on suspensions, removals and reductions.
§ A265-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A265-11
1:827
(1) The Commission shall grant a formal hearing at which witnesses
are examined and cross-examined and a transcript is made within
10 days of the request for such by the accused, provided that the
accused complies with the time frame specified in Subsection B.
The hearing may be continued by the Commission for good and
sufficient reason at the request of the Council or the accused. At
any such hearing the person against whom the charges are made
may be present in person and represented prior to the hearing by
counsel. The suspension, removal or reduction in rank will remain
in effect, pending the determination of the charges against the
accused. In conducting the hearing, the Commission's standard of
review shall be to determine whether sufficient evidence has been
presented to support the statutory reason for the disciplinary
action. In the event the Commission fails to uphold the charges,
then the person sought to be suspended, removed or demoted shall
be reinstated with full pay for the period during which he/she was
suspended, removed or demoted and no charges shall be officially
recorded against his/her record.
(2) The aggrieved party shall have immediate right of appeal to the
Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, and/or the
Commonwealth Court, and the case shall therefore be taken within
30 days from the date of entry by the Commission of its final order
and shall be by petition. The Council and the person sought to be
suspended, removed or demoted shall at all times have the right to
employ counsel before the Commission and upon appeal to the
Court of Common Pleas, and/or the Commonwealth Court.

principals involved in the case; and
[2] By mailing, e-mailing or sending by facsimile a notice to all

any failure to give notice required by this subsection shall
not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the
Commission.
(b) Oaths. All testimony shall be given under oath. The
Chairperson, or in his/her absence the Vice Chairperson, shall
administer all oaths.
(c) Subpoenas. The Chairperson, or in his/her absence the Vice

technical rules of evidence.

§ A265-12. Inspection.
records pertinent to the case. Such records shall be sealed
and not open to public inspection.
[3] The Commission, at any time during the course of the
hearing, may question or cross-examine the person
making charges, the accused and any witnesses.
D. Decision of the Commission. Within 30 days after the later of the
conclusion of the hearing and receipt of the hearing transcript, the
Commission shall issue its decision in the form of a written order
approved by at least two members of the Commission. The written
order shall include all findings of fact. If, during the public hearing,
opposing facts are presented, the Commission shall include in the
written order a decision as to what it considers to be the correct facts.
The findings and decision of the Commission shall be certified to the
person making charges, to the accused officer and to the Borough
Council.
E. Conflict of interest.
(1) Should any Commission member be of relations to, or possess
information of any facts of persons and/or cases which may
prejudice his/her vote, full disclosure of such knowledge shall be
made to all other members of the Commission. At that time:
(a) The member in question may elect to refrain from participation
in the hearing process; or
(b) The other Commission members may vote upon whether or not
the biasing value of the knowledge is such to warrant the
exclusion of member's vote.
(2) If a conflict of interest does occur, and the member's vote is
disqualified, it is imperative that the votes of the two remaining
Commission members be in agreement or else the issue being is
not upheld. If a conflict of interest has occurred, has not been
reported and is then discovered at a later date, the biased vote will
be disqualified, and the decision will rest upon the votes of the
remaining two Commission members.
(3) In the event of multiple recusals in the same case, the Commission
shall appoint an unbiased hearing examiner to preside over the
hearing and make the determination.
A. Inspection in general. Except as otherwise provided in § 265-11C(2)(d)
or other parts of this chapter, all of the records of the Commission shall
be open to the public and available for inspection during normal
business hours. A member of the Commission or any person who may,
from time to time, be designated by the Commission, shall be present at
all times during any inspection of any record of the Commission. The
§ A265-11 MIDDLETOWN CODE § A265-12
1:830
§ A265-13. Commission forms.
Commission shall take appropriate steps to protect the privacy of
identifier information, such as address, social security number, home

employees.
B. Character reports. All reports of investigation and inquiries into the
character of applicants shall not be open to general public inspection.
C. Inspection of examination materials.

consents to an inspection of any of the written examination papers
to a previously examined applicant, it shall state in its letter of
consent the specific examination papers that may be inspected.
Before any member of the Commission, or any person designated
by the Commission, permits any inspection of examination papers,
he/she shall require the examined applicant to produce the letter
indicating the consent of the Commission and shall limit the
inspection by the examined applicant to only those examination

of the Commission:
(1) Application for examination used by the Commission or any of its
authorized agents;

The Borough Council upon its own motion or upon recommendation of the
Commission, may from time to time amend any part of these rules and
regulations insofar as such amendments do not conflict with the Borough
Code or other applicable law.
§ A265-15. Conflicts.
§ A265-16. Authority.
The Borough Council of Middletown adopts these civil service regulations
in accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code appearing at 53 P.S.

the CBA or IAA are more favorable to the police officer, the CBA or
IAA shall control.
(2) To the extent that any issue arises for which the CBA or IAA
controls, the officer shall utilize the grievance and arbitration
procedures of the CBA or IAA, rather than the hearing provision of
