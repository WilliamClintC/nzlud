PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1997 Code, as supplemented through March 9, 2009, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1997 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Michael E. Raabe, Code Attorney, and Deborah J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Sheila Luckett, City Recorder, Mr. Jason Holleman, City Attorney, and Mr. Randy Robertson, City Manager for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note The City of Mount Juliet, Tennessee, was incorporated in 1972 under the Uniform City Manager-Commission Charter as set out in chapters 18 through 29 of title 6, Tennessee Code Annotated. The voters of the city voted to become a "home rule" municipality. The city's charter, as set forth herein, is the Uniform City Manager-Commissioner Charter as it existed at the time the city elected to become a "home rule" city. No home rule charter amendments have been passed as of 2008. Therefore, the city's charter, as extracted from the Tennessee Code Annotated and set forth herein, is the Uniform City Manager-Commission Charter as amended. 
Note This compilation includes chapters 1823 of Title 6, Tennessee Code Annotated, which contain the basic organizational provisions for this form of government, as amended. Important note: There are many other general laws affecting municipalities organized under this charter which have been omitted from this compilation because they apply to all municipalities. These are found in various parts of the Tennessee Code Annotated. This compilation has been amended to reflect legislation passed in the 2008 session of the Tennessee General Assembly. 
The word "Section" or "Sec" has been added to each section for clarity. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. The table of contents, title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
 
CHAPTER 18. - CITY MANAGER-COMMISSION CHARTER; ADOPTION OR SURRENDER 
 
Sec. 6-18-101. - Definitions. 
(a)  The words "city" in chapters 18 to 23, inclusive, of this title shall refer to any city which may adopt the provisions of these chapters, and the word "county" shall refer to the county in which any such city is located. 
(b)  Whenever the "county election commission" is referred to in chapters 18 through 23 of this title, it means the county election commission of the county in which the territory proposed to be incorporated or the municipality is situated. If the territory proposed to be incorporated or the municipality includes parts of two (2) or more counties, it means the county election commission in each of such counties and they shall act jointly in performing the functions required of county election commissions in chapters 18 through 23 of this title.  
Sec. 6-18-102. - Construction of chapters 18 to 23. 
In the construction of any portion of chapters 18 to 23, inclusive, of this title whose meaning or application is in dispute, it is intended that its phraseology shall be liberally construed to effect the substantial objects of these chapters.  
Sec. 6-18-103. - Right to adopt city manager form; incorporation within specified distances from existing cities. 
(a)  The residents of any incorporated municipality or of any territory which it is desired to incorporate shall have the right to adopt the provisions of chapters 18 to 22, inclusive, of this title in the manner herein provided; and thereupon such city or territory shall be and become incorporated and be governed as herein set forth. No unincorporated territory shall be incorporated under the provisions of chapters 18 to 22, inclusive, of this title unless such territory contains not less than fifteen hundred (1,500) persons, who shall be actual residents of the territory, and shall also contain real estate included in the territory worth not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000). No unincorporated territory shall be allowed to hold a referendum on the question of whether or not to incorporate under this charter until a plan of services is documented setting forth the identification and projected timing of municipal services proposed to be provided and the revenue from purely local sources to be payable annually. The plan of services shall be attached to the petition to incorporate when such petition is filed with the county election commission. The plan of services shall include, but not be limited to: police protection, fire protection, water service, sanitary sewage system, solid waste disposal, road and street construction and repair, recreational facilities, a proposed five-year operational budget, including projected revenues and expenditures, and the revenue from purely local sources to be payable annually. Municipalities that are first incorporated on or after July 1, 1993, that produce no local own source revenues in any fiscal year shall not receive any state-shared revenues during the next fiscal year. Prior to filing the petition with the county election commission, a public hearing on the referendum on the question of whether or not to incorporate under this charter and plan of services shall be conducted. The public hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation for two (2) consecutive weeks. 
(b)  No unincorporated territory shall be incorporated within three (3) miles of an existing municipality or within five (5) miles of an existing municipality of one hundred thousand (100,000) or more in population, according to the latest census certified by the State Planning Office. "Existing municipality" and "existing municipality of one hundred thousand (100,000) or more in population" do not include any county with a metropolitan form of government with a population of one hundred thousand (100,000) or more according to the latest census certified by the State Planning Office. 
(c), (d)  [Deleted by 1995 amendment.] 
(e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) to the contrary, a territory may be incorporated if the following conditions are fulfilled: 
(1)  The territory contains two hundred twenty-five (225) residents or more; 
(2)  The territory is composed of property which is sixteen hundred (1600) feet or more above sea level on the western border of the territory and contiguous with a county boundary on the eastern border of the territory; 
(3)  The territory is located within an area which is bordered on the west, north and east by the Tennessee River and on the south by the border between Tennessee and another State; and 
(4)  The territory is located within a metropolitan statistical area. 
(f)  (1)  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section to the contrary, a territory may be incorporated that meets the following conditions: 
(A)  The territory contains three hundred (300) residents or more; 
(B)  The territory's western boundary is contiguous with the western boundary of the county in which it is located; 
(C)  The territory is located within an area bordered on the north by the Loosahatchie River, on the south of the Wolf River; 
(D)  The territory's eastern boundary is approximately parallel with the western boundary, but in no place is more than eight (8) miles from the western boundary; and 
(E)  The territory is located within a metropolitan statistical area. 
(2)  The territory described in this subsection may incorporate notwithstanding the provisions and restrictions in § 6-18-103(a) and (b). 
(g)  Notwithstanding the requirements of § 6-18-104, or any other provision of law to the contrary, the petition for incorporation of the territory described in this subsection may consist of a letter from a resident of the territory desiring to incorporate to the county election commission requesting that the question of incorporating the territory be placed on the ballot. The letter shall describe the exact boundaries of the proposed municipality, indicate the name of the proposed municipality, and indicate under which charter the territory desires to incorporate. The letter shall be treated as a petition meeting all the requirements of law. 
(h)  (1)  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, whenever the governing body of any existing city affected by this section, by a resolution adopted by a majority vote of its governing body, indicates that it has no interest in annexing the property to be incorporated, and when a certified copy of such resolution and a petition requesting that an incorporation election be held are filed with the county election commission, then the proceedings shall continue as provided in this chapter as though the proposed new incorporation were not within the specified distance of such existing city as provided in this section. 
(2)  The provisions of this act shall only apply in counties having a population of not less than 80,000 nor more than 83,000 according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census; provided, that in any adjoining county an existing municipality that is within the specified distance may also use the procedure authorized by this subsection.  
Sec. 6-18-104. - Election to adopt city manager form. 
(a)  An election for the purpose of determining whether or not chapters 18-22 of this title shall become effective for any city shall be included on the ballot at the next election, as defined in § 2-1-104, by the county election commission upon the request or petition in writing of thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3 %) of the registered voters of the city or territory, which petition shall state therein in a sufficient manner the boundaries of the proposed municipal corporation, which may be done by a general reference to the boundaries then existing if there is one. The county election commission shall, in addition to all other notices required by law, publish one (1) notice of the election in a newspaper of general circulation within the territory of the city or of the proposed city and post the notice in at least ten (10) places in the territory. 
(b)  At any time not less than thirty (30) days prior to the election provided for herein, the request or petition may be withdrawn or may be amended to call for a smaller territory for the proposed municipal corporation so long as all of the proposed smaller territory is contained within the boundaries of the territory described in the first petition or request. The withdrawal or amendment shall be valid if filed with the county election commission in writing and executed by twenty percent (20%) of the number of the registered voters voting at the last election within the boundaries of the territory described in the original request or petition, and if signed by not less than fifty-one percent (51%) of those who signed the original request or petition. In the event such an amended request or petition is filed, all provisions relating to time periods in § 6-18-103 shall be controlled by the date of the filing of the original petition, notwithstanding the filing of the amended request or petition, and the county election commission shall publish the notice of the election as provided for herein. A petition for request to withdraw, when filed with and validated by the county election commission, shall render the original request or petition null and void. 
(c)  Following the defeat of an incorporation in an election held pursuant to this section, no new request for petition for an election may be filed until after the expiration of four (4) years. Provided, however, that if the territory included in the boundaries of the newly proposed municipal corporation includes less than fifty percent (50%) of the territory subject to incorporation in such previous election and if the territory subject to incorporation in such election comprises less than fifty percent (50%) of the territory included in the boundaries of the newly proposed municipal corporation, the four (4) year waiting period shall not be required. 
(d)  (1)  If a proposal to incorporate a territory is defeated in an election held pursuant to this section by a number of negative votes comprising more than sixty percent (60%) of the persons voting, no further incorporation election shall be held for a period of four (4) years from the previous election unless the conditions established in subsection (c) are met. 
(2)  If a proposal to incorporate a territory is defeated in an election held pursuant to this section by a number of negative votes comprising less than sixty percent (60%) of the persons voting, no further incorporation election shall be held for a period of two (2) years from the previous election unless the conditions established in subsection (c) are met.  
Sec. 6-18-105. - Registration of voters; qualifications to vote; certification of result. 
(a)  The county election commission shall use such methods authorized by title 2 as it judges necessary to facilitate registration before the election. 
(b)  All registered voters of the city or of the territory of the proposed city are eligible to vote in the election. 
(c)  The county election commission shall determine and declare the results of the election and shall certify the results within forty-eight (48) hours after it completes its duties under § 2-8-105(3). It shall publish the certificate in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or territory and if the city is already incorporated, shall file the certificate with the city council or other legislative body of the city at its first meeting after the certification. The certificate shall be entered at large on the minutes of the body with which it is filed.  
Sec. 6-18-106. - Effect of favorable vote. 
If it shall thereupon be found that the majority of the votes cast are in favor of the adoption of chapters 18 to 23, inclusive, of this title it shall be deemed to have been adopted. Except for the provisions of chapters 18-22 of this title that are adopted by reference in other municipal charters, the provisions of chapters 18-22 of this title apply only to those cities that have adopted chapters 18-22 of this title by referendum as authorized by law.  
Sec. 6-18-107. - Succession to old corporation. 
(a)  Chapters 18 to 23, inclusive, of this title shall take effect in any city immediately after the election and organization of the first board of commissioners provided for herein, and thereupon any then existing charter of such city shall immediately become abrogated and null; provided, however, that the right, title and ownership of all property of the city and all of its uncollected taxes, dues, claims, judgments, and chooses in action, and all of its rights of every kind whatsoever, shall immediately become vested in the corporation so chartered under these chapters; and the new corporation shall answer and be liable for all debts, contracts, and obligations of the corporation which it succeeds in the same manner and proportion and to the same extent as the former corporation was liable under existing laws; and provided further, that all ordinances, laws, resolutions, and bylaws duly enacted and in force under the preexisting charter and not inconsistent with the provisions of chapters 18 to 23, inclusive, of this title shall remain in full force until repealed, modified, or amended as herein provided. 
(b)  The zoning ordinance duly enacted and in force in any county shall apply to any unincorporated territory in the county incorporated under the provisions of chapters 18 through 23, inclusive, of this title, until such incorporated city shall duly enact zoning ordinances, or for a period of six (6) months from the date the first board of commissioners shall take their respective offices, whichever occurs first.  
Sec. 6-18-108. - Surrender of charter. 
(a)  After the adoption of this charter and the election of the commissioners, a majority of whom are elected for a period of four (4) years as hereinafter provided, no election for the surrender of this charter shall be called or held for a period of four (4) years from the date the first board of commissioners shall take their respective offices. 
(b)  After the expiration of the four (4) year period and upon the filing of a petition in the same manner as provided for the adoption of chapters 18 through 23, inclusive, of this title, containing the signatures of the same number of registered voters and praying for a surrender of such charter, an election shall be held to determine whether or not the same shall be surrendered, provided that in case of a failure to surrender such charter, election shall not be held more frequently than at two (2) year intervals thereafter, and provided further, that for a period of four (4) years after the first board of commissioners shall take office, the cost of calling and holding such an election shall be borne by those petitioning therefor, if such election does not result in a surrender of this form of charter. Should such election, however, result in a surrender, the cost of such election shall be borne by the city and following the expiration of such four (4) year period the cost of such election shall be borne by the city.  
Sec. 6-18-109. - Conduct of surrender election. 
The county election commission has the same duties with respect to an election for the surrender of a charter as it has with respect to an election to adopt a charter under this title. Any registered voter of the city may vote in the election.  
Sec. 6-18-110. - Termination of charter; new charter. 
If a majority of the votes cast in the election herein provided shall favor the termination of such form of government the provisions of such charter shall terminate at 12:01 a.m. on the sixtieth (60th) day next following the date of such election unless the same falls upon Sunday, in which case it shall terminate at 12:01 a.m. on the next day. If previous to the adoption of this form of charter such city or town functions under a different charter, thereupon such prior charter shall become effective at the time above mentioned, and territory previously unincorporated shall revert to that status; provided, however, that if by law in the case of unincorporated territory another charter may be adopted by vote of the electors, the question as to whether or not such other form of charter shall be adopted may be placed upon the ballots to be used in the election herein mentioned, if the petition filed requests the same, and if all other necessary legal steps to adopt such other form of charter have been taken prior thereto.  
Sec. 6-18-111. - Election of new officers after surrender of charter. 
In case there shall be a previously incorporated city or if a new charter shall be adopted as provided herein, the county election commission shall call an election not less than forty (40) days nor more than fifty (50) days following the election for surrender of the charters provided herein, at which time municipal officials for the newly adopted form of government shall be chosen who shall take office upon the date fixed for the termination of the previous charter. The qualifying deadline for filing nominating petitions shall be noon of the sixth Thursday before the election. All registered voters of the municipality may vote in the election.  
Sec. 6-18-112. - Succession to assets and liabilities after surrender of charter. 
In case of a reversion to a former form of charter or adoption of a new one simultaneously with the surrender of the old, all assets, liabilities and obligations of such city shall become such of the new municipality, and in the event that a city shall revert to an unincorporated status, the governing body of such city thereupon shall become trustees of the property and funds of such former city and under such bonds as may be required by the county legislative body, shall proceed to terminate the affairs of the city and dispose of its property.  
Sec. 6-18-113. - Liquidation of affairs. 
Should the property and funds be more than sufficient to meet the city's obligations, the surplus shall be paid into the treasury of the county to become a part of its general fund. Should the property and funds be insufficient to meet all the city's current obligations, the county legislative body is hereby authorized to levy and collect taxes upon the property within the boundaries of the former city and to pay same over to the trustees for the purpose of meeting such current deficit. The trustees shall terminate the affairs of the city as soon as possible, but in no event shall the trusteeship continue for more than thirty-six (36) months. Any matters, including obligations maturing after thirty-six (36) months, not disposed of within the period herein designated shall become the responsibility of the county legislative body of the county wherein the city is located.  
Sec. 6-18-114. - New incorporations; situs based taxes. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, whenever a new municipality incorporates under any form of charter, the county or counties in which the new municipality is located shall continue to receive the revenue from all state and local taxes distributed on the basis of situs of collection, generated within the newly incorporated area, until July 1 following the incorporation, unless the incorporation takes effect on July 1. 
(b)  If the incorporation takes effect on July 1, then the municipality shall begin receiving revenue from such taxes generated within its corporate boundaries for the period beginning July 1. 
(c)  Whenever a municipality incorporates, the municipality shall notify the Department of Revenue of such incorporation prior to the incorporation becoming effective for the purpose of tax administration. 
(d)  Such taxes shall include the local sales tax authorized in § 67-6-103, the income tax on dividends authorized in § 67-2-102, and all other such taxes distributed to counties and municipalities based on the situs of their collection.  
CHAPTER 19. - POWERS UNDER CITY MANAGER-COMMISSION CHARTER 
 
Sec. 6-19-101. - General power to enact ordinances. 
Every city incorporated under Chapters 18-22 of this title may:

(7)  Expend the money of the city for all lawful purposes; 
(8)  Acquire or receive and hold, maintain, improve, sell, lease, mortgage, pledge, or otherwise dispose of property, real or personal, and any estate or interest therein, within or without the city or state; 
(9)  Condemn property, real or personal or any easement, interest, or estate or use therein, either within or without the city, for present or future public use; such condemnation to be made and effected in accordance with the terms and provisions of title 29, chapter 16, or in such other manner as may be provided by general law;

Such power to grant franchises shall embrace the power hereby expressly conferred, to grant exclusive franchises, and whenever an exclusive franchise is granted, it shall be exclusive not only as against any other person, firm, association, or corporation, but also as against the city itself. Franchises may be granted for the period of twenty-five (25) years or less, but not longer.

Sec. 6-19-102. - Enumeration of powers not exclusive. 
The enumeration of particular powers in this charter is not exclusive of others, nor restrictive of general words or phrases granting powers, nor shall a grant or failure to grant power in this chapter impair a power granted in any other part of this charter and whether powers, objects, or purposes are expressed, conjunctively or disjunctively, they shall be construed so as to permit the city to exercise freely any one (1) or more such powers as to any one (1) or more such objects for any one (1) or more such purposes.  
Sec. 6-19-103. - School systems. 
Such town may establish, erect, and maintain public schools, and may assess and levy taxes for such purpose.  
Sec. 6-19-104. - Purchasing and contract procedures. 
(a)  The city manager shall be responsible for all city purchasing, but he may delegate the duty to make purchases to any subordinate appointed by him.

The transaction shall be evidenced by written contract.

The ordinance shall enumerate the types of matters to which the city manager's authority extends and may place other limitations on the city manager's authority under this subsection. As used in this subsection, "routine matters and matters having insubstantial long-term consequences" means any contract for which expenditures during the fiscal year will be less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000).  
Sec. 6-19-105. - Retirement benefits.

CHAPTER 20. - COMMISSIONERS AND MAYOR UNDER CITY MANAGER-COMMISSION CHARTER  
PART 1. - ELECTION OF COMMISSIONERS 
 
Sec. 6-20-101. - Number and terms of commissioners; districts. 
(a)  In all cities that adopt the provisions of chapters 1823 of this title, commissioners as herein provided for shall be elected in the manner herein prescribed. 
(b)  If such city or territory has a population of five thousand (5,000) or over by the last federal census, there shall be elected at the first election five (5) commissioners, the three (3) receiving the highest number of votes to hold for four (4) years, and the other two (2) for two (2) years; and, if such city or territory has a population of less than five thousand (5,000) by the last federal census, there shall be elected at the first election three (3) commissioners, the two (2) receiving the highest number of votes to hold for four (4) years and the third for two (2) years; and the term of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and qualified. Provided, however, that any such city which has a population of not less than two thousand nine hundred twenty (2,920) nor more than two thousand nine hundred twenty-two (2,922) according to the federal census of 1960 or any subsequent federal census, five (5) commissioners shall be elected as provided for above for cities of more than five thousand (5,000) population. The deadline for filing nominating petitions for the first commissioners is thirty-five (35) days before the incorporation election. 
(c)  Any city having a population of less than five thousand (5,000) shall have the option of increasing the number of commissioners to five (5) by ordinance. In the next regular city election after the adoption of such an ordinance, voters shall be entitled to vote for three (3) commissioners, or four (4) commissioners as the case may be, and at the same election the approval of the ordinance shall also be submitted to the voters. If a majority of those voting on the ordinance shall be for approval and the number of commissioners to be elected is three (3), the two (2) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the third for two (2) years. If the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4), the two (2) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the other two (2) for two (2) years. The terms of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and qualified. An ordinance approved by the voters may not be repealed or amended. If a majority of those voting on the ordinance shall not be for approval, the ordinance shall be null and void, and the results of the election shall be certified as though the election were for one (1) commissioner, or two (2) commissioners as the case may be, and as though no ordinance had been adopted. 
(d)  An ordinance increasing the number of commissioners to five (5) may also be submitted to the voters in an election on the question which the board of commissioners directs the county election commission to hold. At such election voters shall be entitled to vote for two (2) commissioners to serve until the next regular city election. If a majority of those voting on the ordinance shall be for approval, the two (2) candidates for commissioner receiving the highest number of votes shall be declared elected. At the next regular city election if the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4), the three (3) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the fourth for two (2) years; if the number of commissioners to be elected is three (3), they shall hold office for four (4) years. The terms of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and qualified. If a majority of those voting on the ordinance in the special election shall not be for approval, the ordinance and the election of the two (2) commissioners shall be null and void. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(d), a city with a population of not less than six hundred (600) nor more than six hundred twenty-five (625) persons according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, located in a county with a population in excess of seven hundred thousand (700,000) persons also according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, shall elect all commissioners at one (1) time for a four-year term so that the city may be spared the expense of conducting elections every two (2) years. In order to effectuate this provision, all commissioners to be elected at the 1983 election shall be elected to a two-year term only, to serve until the 1985 election at which time, and every four (4) years thereafter, all commissioners shall be elected to four-year terms. The provisions of this subsection shall have no effect unless approved by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the governing body of any municipality to which it may apply. 
(f)  Cities which have adopted § 6-20-201(a)(3) to provide for popular election of the mayor shall have two (2) or four (4) commissioners as the case may be under subsection (b) or (c). 
(g)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(f), any city incorporated under or adopting this charter may, by ordinance, choose to elect the members of the board of commissioners by district. If the board chooses to elect commissioners by district, the board shall by ordinance create contiguous single-member districts equal to the number of commissioners. The districts shall be equitably apportioned according to population. The establishment of the districts and the fixing of their boundaries shall be accomplished not less than twelve (12) months prior to the regular city election at which commissioners are to be elected, and any change in district boundaries shall also be accomplished within this time limitation. The board shall within ten (10) years from the initial establishment of districts, and at least once in every ten (10) years thereafter, reapportion the districts so that the apportionment shall comply with the requirements of this section. One (1) commissioner shall be elected from each district of the city. The ordinance providing that the commissioners will be chosen by districts may provide that each district commissioner will be elected by the voters of the city at-large or by only the voters of the district. A person must reside in a district to run for or hold the office of commissioner from that district. The ordinance providing that commissioners will be chosen by district may also provide for transition provisions, including increasing the terms of the number of commissioners necessary so that the initial election from all districts shall take place at the same time. The ordinance may provide that all commissioners initially elected serve four-year terms or that some serve four (4) years and some serve two (2) years. If some are elected for two (2) years, their successors shall be elected for four (4) years, so that the commissioners have staggered terms. After the initial election, all commissioners shall be elected for four-year terms. 
(h)  Any city having a population of more than twenty thousand (20,000), according to the last federal census, shall have the option of increasing the number of commissioners to seven (7) by ordinance. Upon adoption of such an ordinance, it shall be filed with the county election commission, which shall submit approval of the ordinance to the voters of the city at the next general election or regular city election that follows the filing period required pursuant to § 2-3-204(b). If a majority of those voting on the ordinance are not for approval, the ordinance shall be null and void. If a majority of those voting on the ordinance are for approval, then at the next regular city election, voters shall be entitled to vote for four (4) commissioners, or five (5) commissioners, as the case may be, in order to provide for a total of seven (7) commissioners. If the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4), each shall hold office for four (4) years. If the number of commissioners to be elected is five (5), the three (3) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the other two (2) for two (2) years. The terms of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and qualified. An ordinance approved by the voters pursuant to this section may not be repealed or amended.

Sec. 2-254. - Vehicle use policy. 
(a)  It is the policy of the city that certain positions require employee access to municipal vehicles, either during the work shift or on a 24-hour on-call basis. City vehicles are not personal vehicles and are not for personal use. City vehicles should be viewed as belonging to the citizens of the city and are assigned solely for the purposes consistent with providing services to citizens. 
(b)  The assignment of municipal vehicles during work time is based upon job description. Department heads who have municipal vehicles available for this purpose may assign such vehicles in a manner consistent with departmental workload and employee function. The assignment of vehicles may be rescinded at any time by the city manager. The city manager and department heads shall assign a vehicle to a specific employee on an ongoing basis only when the normal daily tasks of the employee requires him to travel by vehicle for official business on a daily basis. Employees who need to use a city vehicle for incidental tasks shall use a vehicle from an unassigned vehicle pool, which use shall be governed by the city policy for an unassigned vehicle pool which is to be established by the city manager. 
(c)  The provisions of this assigned vehicle use policy shall apply to all general government employees, excluding the city manager. Vehicle use by the city manager is controlled by the contract, if any, between the city and the city manager and is not regulated by this policy. 
(d)  Vehicles assigned for 24-hour use. 
(1)  The assignment of vehicles for 24-hour use will be made in writing by the city manager, and will only be considered for employees who require a vehicle for the ordinary and necessary discharge of their job functions. Criteria which will be used in the determination of eligibility for 24-hour vehicle use include the following: 
a.  Officially designated on-call status; 
b.  Requirement for frequent emergency availability; 
c.  Issuance of a pager or other communication device; 
d.  Emergency or other equipment contained in the vehicle. 
(2)  Vehicle use is limited to travel to and from the residence and place of work. The vehicle should be driven over the most direct route taking into account road and traffic conditions. The vehicle should not be utilized for travel outside a direct commuting route for personal reasons. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the authorization for 24-hour use shall be reevaluated. Employees assigned municipal vehicles on a 24-hour basis will be given a copy of this policy and will be required to sign a confirmation receipt. Employees authorized to commute in a city vehicle may be subject to imputed income tax regulations as set forth by the Internal Revenue Service, which considers a certain portion of the vehicle use (namely the commute) to be income for the purposes of income taxation. On December 1 of each year, the finance director shall be responsible for determining any tax liability and will be provided by department heads with the names of all employees authorized during that calendar year to use city vehicles for commuting purposes, and the normal, one-way commuting distance. 
(e)  Rules governing use. The following are rules governing vehicles assigned for 24-hour use: 
(1)  Municipal vehicles will not be used to transport passengers who are not related to municipal business. Passengers shall be limited to city employees and individuals who are directly associated with city work activity (committee members, consultants, contractors, etc.). Family members shall not be transported in city vehicles without the written prior approval of the department head and city manager on a case-by-case basis. Such transportation may only occur during the incidental use of the city vehicle, on the most direct route between the employee's home and work location or during funerals, parades, and similar ceremonial occasions. A liability waiver must be executed by any city employee's family member riding in a city vehicle prior to riding in that vehicle. In the event that the family member is a child, the liability waiver must be executed by such child's legal parent or guardian. All liability waivers must be delivered to the city manager at least one day prior to any family member riding in a city vehicle. 
(2)  In emergencies where the city employee has a reasonable belief, based on a totality of circumstances, that the life, safety, health, or physical welfare of a citizen would be immediately threatened without the security and/or transportation the city vehicle could provide him, a city employee may transport a citizen in a city vehicle. Examples of such emergencies include, but are not limited to, accidents involving personal injury, acute illness, and actual and potential victims of crime and violence. 
(3)  Vehicles should contain only those items for which the vehicle is designed. The city shall not be liable for the loss or damage of any personal property transported in the vehicle. 
(4)  Employees are expected to keep municipal vehicles clean, and to report any malfunction or damage to their supervisor immediately. 
(5)  Employees who are assigned vehicles for commuting purposes are expected to park such vehicles in safe locations. 
(6)  All vehicle occupants must wear seatbelts during operation of a vehicle. 
(7)  Employees may not operate municipal vehicles under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or prescription drugs or medications which may interfere with effective and safe operation. 
(8)  Employees who operate municipal vehicles must have a valid motor vehicle license issued by the state and may be required to provide proof of valid motor vehicle license. 
(9)  Employees driving municipal vehicles shall obey all applicable traffic and parking regulations, ordinances, and laws: 
a.  Employees who incur parking or other fines in municipal vehicles will be personally responsible for payment of such fines. 
b.  Employees who are issued citations for any offense while using a municipal vehicle must notify their supervisor immediately when practicable, but in no case later than the next city work day. Failure to provide such notice may be grounds for disciplinary action. 
c.  An employee who is assigned a municipal vehicle and who is convicted of a motor vehicle offense for which the punishment imposed includes suspension or revocation of the motor vehicle license, whether in his personal vehicle or in a municipal vehicle, must notify his supervisor immediately when practicable, but in no case later than the next city work day. Conviction for such an offense may be grounds for loss of municipal vehicle privileges and/or further disciplinary action. 
(10)  No employee may use a municipal vehicle for out-of-state use without advance approval of the city manager. 
(11)  Failure to comply with any and all provisions of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including removal of city vehicle privileges, suspension, and/or termination of employment. 
(12)  All employees will be given a copy of this policy and will be required to sign a confirmation receipt.

b.  A copy of the request for cell phone service and agreement must be completed and signed by both the employee and the department head. 
c.  Any and all costs incurred due to personal use of a telephone shall be reimbursed to the city upon receipt of billing.

a.  Does not include any minutes of talk time, then all personal calls should be identified and reimbursed to the city. 
b.  Includes a set amount of minutes, and the limit is not exceeded, then any personal calls will not have increased the cost to the city and do not need to be reimbursed. 
c.  Includes a set amount of minutes, and the limit was exceeded, then all minutes for personal calls, up to the amount exceeding the limit, should be reimbursed to the city.

Sec. 4-62. - On-premises consumption beer permit; issuance requirements. 
It is the intent of this article to only issue permits for on-premises consumption of beer to 1) restaurants for the sale of beer along with meals; and 2) hotels/motels for the purpose of serving their registered guests. All other establishments primarily selling beer for on-premises consumption and not food are prohibited from maintaining a permit for on-premises consumption. 
(1)  Retailer on-premises consumption beer permits shall not be issued except to establishments with seating capacities, and actual seating for 95 or more persons except for those holding a valid on-premises permit on or before June 17, 2002, shall be required to maintain a seating capacity of 75 or more persons. 
(2)  Such businesses shall have complete and sanitary kitchen facilities. Such businesses shall be equipped with adequate toilet facilities and hand washing facilities, including hot and cold running water, for use by customers. 
(3)  Required ratio of gross sales to wholesale beer purchases. 
a.  Beer permits for on-premises consumption shall maintain an annual ratio of $5.00 of gross sales, excluding all sales dollars of intoxicating liquor on or after the effective date of the passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived, for each $1.00 of wholesale beer purchases, except for those holding a valid on-premises beer permit on or before June 17, 2002, shall be required to maintain $4.00 of gross sales, excluding all sales dollars of intoxicating liquor on or after the effective date of the passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived, for each $1.00 of wholesale beer purchases. 
b.  The calendar year, or the part thereof ending on December 31, shall be used for the calculation of sales ratios. 
c.  The calculation of the ratio shall be made using the permit holder's sales tax returns for the previous calendar year after subtracting the gross sales of intoxicating liquor as measured by the permit holder's liquor by the drink tax returns for the previous calendar year and comparing the difference to the permit holder's total dollar sales for the previous calendar year. 
d.  The calculation required in paragraph a. shall be made by the permit holder and provided to the ABB by January 31 of each calendar year. If the permit holder fails the test, the holder shall be subject to penalty as set forth in other sections of this article. Additionally, if the permit holder fails the test it shall be subject to an additional test, and such sales information as required must be submitted by April 30 of the calendar year of the failed test. Such test will encompass the sales information for the time period between April 1 of the previous year and March 30 of the new year. If the permit holder fails the test, the holder shall be subject to penalty as set forth in other sections of this article. Additionally, if the permit holder fails this second test then his permit shall be revoked and he shall not be allowed to apply for a new permit for a period of six months. 
e.  To the extent a permit holder has not had an on premises consumption permit for 12 months as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, subsection (b) is modified to read that, for the permit holders' first year in operation, the holder's sales will be measured from the date of issuance of the permit to 12 months from that date. The permit holder shall be responsible for preparing the information required under subsection (c) for the 12 month period in question. Subsection (d) is modified for the purpose of subsection (e) in that the documents required per subsection (c) are due by the last day of the month following the end of the 12 month period after the permit holder obtained a permit. Further, if the permit holder fails this test, the permit holder shall be required to submit its sales for its thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth months of operation. If the permit holder, for months four through 15, remains non-compliant, the permit shall be revoked and the holder shall not be allowed to apply for a new permit for a period of six months. Any person holding a permit as of January 1 of a new year shall be placed back onto the standard track as set forth in subsections (b) and (d). 
f.  To the extent a complaint is made to the alcoholic beverage board by any person, that an establishment is allegedly selling beer in violation of the ratio requirements, the Board may require any permit holder to provide the information required by subsection (c) for the most recent 12 month period, or the length of time the permit holder has been in business if less than 12 months. If the ratio is less than $2.50 in gross sales excluding liquor for every $1.00 in wholesale beer purchases, the board has discretion to suspend the permit for up to two months. A second violation of this provision in a 12 month period shall result in revocation of a permit. The holder shall be prohibited from requesting a new permit for a period of six months. 
(4)  All establishments selling beer for on-premises consumption shall be connected to the public sanitary sewer and have adequate sanitary restrooms and kitchen facilities. 
(5)  Hotels/motels. 
a.  Subsections (1) through (4) of this section shall not apply to hotels/motels. Hotels/motels will be eligible for beer permits so long as: a) the hotel/motel has at least 100 guest rooms intended to be used for overnight stays that contain both individual bedding and individual access to sanitary sewer; and b) the hotel/motel serves only hotel patrons and their guests. Subject to rules and regulations adopted by a hotel/motel license pursuant to this article, the premises where such beer may be consumed includes the entirety of the hotel/motel grounds. Beer sold pursuant to such a hotel/motel permit shall not be permitted to be consumed off of the hotel/motel's premises in any instance. In addition to other penalties set forth in article III, chapter 4 of this Code, a hotel/motel beer permit holder shall likewise be penalized for violations of this subsection (5). 
b.  The licensed permit holder for the hotel/motel shall be the general manager of the hotel/motel or person of equivalent position. Each new general manager or person of equivalent position must meet all criterion in this chapter for the holder of a beer permit.

The procedures in T.C.A. § 57-5-108 are the sole method for review of decisions under this section, as they may be amended. 
(f)  Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, pursuant to T.C.A. § 57-5-108 the board may, at the time it imposes a revocation or suspension, offer a permit or license holder the alternative of paying a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 for each offense. If a vendor is guilty of selling beer to a minor and the permit holder has failed to achieve responsible vendor status pursuant to T.C.A. § 57-5-606 then this civil penalty is increased to a maximum of $2,500.00, but remains a maximum of $1,000.00 for any other offense. If a civil penalty is offered as an alternative to revocation or suspension, the holder shall have seven days within which to pay the civil penalty before the revocation or suspension shall be imposed. If the civil penalty is paid within that time, the revocation or suspension shall be deemed withdrawn. The holder's payment of a civil penalty shall not affect the holder's ability to seek review of the civil penalty. 
(g)  The board shall suspend a permit for a minimum 90-day period when the permitee has violated any provision of this chapter on three or more occasions within a ten-year period. 
(h)  If the holder of an off-premises consumption permit violates any provision of this article, the alcoholic beverage board, in addition to suspension, revocation, or a civil penalty, retains the right to revoke or suspend the permit holder's ability to give away samples.

If, after such notice and hearing, the public officer determines that the structure under consideration is unfit for human occupancy or use, he shall state in writing his finding of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order: 
a.  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure, not exceeding 50 percent of the reasonable value, requiring the owner, during the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such structure to render it fit for human occupancy or use or, to vacate and close the structure for human occupancy or use; or

ARTICLE V. - AGGRESSIVE SOLICITATION 
 
Sec. 16-121. - Legislative findings. 
(a)  The commission finds that the increase in aggressive solicitation throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses, and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. 
(b)  Aggressive solicitation usually includes approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive soliciting despite refusals, the use of abusive or profane language to cause fear and intimidation, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The commission further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks, automated teller machines, or in public transportation vehicles is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in those confined environments. Motorists also find themselves confronted by persons seeking money who, without permission, wash their automobile windows at traffic intersections, despite explicit indications by drivers not to do so. Such activity carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property. People driving or parking on city streets frequently find themselves faced with persons seeking money by offering to open car doors or locate parking spaces. 
(c)  The commission is enacting this article pursuant to its police power. 
(d)  The law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity. Rather, its goal is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city.

A police officer driving a police vehicle in pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law may deviate from normal legal driving rules after weighing the need for haste against the dangers to other people using the roads. In weighing the need for haste, police officers shall weigh the seriousness of the violation of person pursued. They shall also weigh the public danger of people escaping at will from violations by merely fleeing. In pursuing someone merely for violating a traffic law, they shall consider the need for high-speed pursuit once they have obtained a license number. 
(b)  Fire and ambulance emergency runs. The driver of an ambulance or fire engine shall obey all driving laws under normal conditions, as for example returning from a fire call, but may deviate from the driving laws in an emergency when it appears to the driver that the deviation can be done safely and it appears to the driver that the benefits of the deviation outweigh the risk to the public.

DIVISION 2. - USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS 
 
Sec. 30-44. - Connection with sanitary sewer required. 
Every building having plumbing fixtures installed and intended for human habitation, occupancy, or use on premises abutting a street, alley, or easement in which segment there is a sanitary sewer which is within 200 feet of the building drain of the parcel shall be considered as being served by the city's sanitary sewer system. 
All buildings hereafter constructed on property which is served by the publicly owned treatment works shall not be occupied until connected to the public sewer. The owner or occupant of each lot or parcel of land which is now served or which may hereafter be served by the Mt. Juliet sewer system feeding into a publicly owned treatment works shall cease to use any other method for the disposal of sewage except as provided for direct discharge by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation or by discharge to a properly functioning and approved septic tank. Septic tanks shall not be used where sewers are available unless the user is exempt under the following provisions. The public works director shall decide whether sewers are available using the criteria established herein. All premises served by the publicly owned treatment works are subject to sewer use charges as described in [sections 30-356 through 30-370] unless exempt under the following exemptions. 
Natural persons meeting all of the following conditions are exempt from mandatory hookup and use charges: 
(1)  Original or annexed owners: Owners of residential property who have owned and occupied the property continuously since September 30, 1987, or who were or are annexed into the city thereafter are exempt from mandatory connection and from payment of mandatory use charges and mandatory connection (but not the availability charge) if: 
a.  They have not transferred the property or any ownership interest therein; and 
b.  Their private system is not defective and does not hereafter become defective for a continuous ten-day period; and 
c.  They have not constructed a new dwelling or workplace on the property since September 30, 1987; and 
d.  They have not voluntarily purchased a tap other than pursuant to a condemnation settlement or as a part of a settlement about sewer right-of-way acquisition by the city; and 
e.  The property is used only as the home of the owner. 
(2)  Owners of property to which sewers become available: Owners of residential property to which sewers become available, and who do not meet the criteria of paragraph (1) above, shall pay the same charge which they would pay if connected to the sewer. They shall be required to pay connection and tap fees and shall connect to the sewer system when the first of the following events occur: 
a.  The day they sell the property; or 
b.  The occurrence of failure or defect of their septic or other alternative sewer system for a continuous period of ten days; or 
c.  The date of completion of a new dwelling. 
(3)  Purchasers of property to which sewer is available: Any purchaser of property containing a habitable structure, who does not meet the exemptions contained in the preceding two paragraphs, shall immediately pay any unpaid tap or connection fees and connect the property to the sewer system. The seller of property shall be responsible to the buyer for paying the tap fee and connection charges unless they agree otherwise in writing. Both the buyer and seller shall be responsible to the city for the tap fee and all connection charges. 
(4)  People totally exempt: People who have owned and occupied their homes since October 31, 1984, are exempt from the availability charge and from any minimum charge on the home unless they are connected to the system or have purchased a tap or their alternative septic system is failing. This exemption is granted because it was the promise made to them at the time the system was proposed (see Ord. 87-10 Sec. 2 et. al.) and bought their acquiescence in the construction of the system, without which the system may have never been built. 
(5)  Water not entering the sewer system. To the extent feasible sewer use charges are based upon water placed in the sewer system by the user. The amount of water used by an owner or occupant of property shall be the amount used to establish the amount of water entering the sewer system. Any person using an unmetered source of water such as a well, shall install a meter and notify the director of public works. Adjustments for use of water during warm weather and peak use months shall be provided for by totaling the charges billed in the months of December, January, February and March and obtaining the average of these bills by dividing the total of the four months bills by four. The amount derived shall be the amount billed during the months of June, July, August, September, October and November. The remaining months will be billed for actual use. 
If a sewer user can prove to the satisfaction of the public works director that a specific amount of water is not going to the system, and is not adjusted, the public works director is authorized, subject to approval of the city manager, to adjust the bill. If such adjustments are recurring the public works director may require the user to obtain a separate meter and system, for measuring water not going to the sewer system, as a requirement to consideration of further adjustments. (Amended by Ordinance 98-46 dated 12-7-98). 
(b)  Unconnected sewer service lines prohibited. Except for discharge to a properly functioning septic tank system or discharges permitted by an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the discharge of sewage into places other than the publicly owned treatment works is prohibited. 
(c)  Insufficient capacity, connection moratorium. In those parts of the sewer system where no additional capacity exists and a sewer moratorium has been established pursuant to orders of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, no new or additional sewer connections shall be permitted. Permits issued prior to the date of the moratorium may be completed. No new plumbing permits shall be issued for new buildings in a moratorium area after the effective date of the moratorium. A moratorium shall continue to be in effect until capacity restriction has been corrected. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)

Sec. 30-46. - Right to enter and inspect connection. 
The public works director, building inspector, or their representative shall have free and unobstructed access to any part of the premises where house drains or other drains connected with or draining into the sanitary sewer are laid for the purpose of examining the construction, condition, and method of use of the same, upon cause of reasonable suspicion that there may be inadequate facilities, the facilities present may not be properly functioning, there is an improper discharge, or upon a periodic systematic inspection of a particular drainage basin or other large segment of the system through those facilities at any time of the day between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. or at any other time in the event of an emergency. If such entry is refused, the sewer service may be disconnected upon reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The service may be suspended immediately in the event of an emergency if there is reasonable cause to suspect that the discharge will endanger the public health or the environment, shall have the potential to disrupt the treatment process, or shall damage the publicly owned treatment work's lines or facilities, and a hearing shall thereafter be afforded the user as soon as possible. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-47. - Demolished buildings. 
When a building is demolished, it shall be the responsibility of the owner to have the sewer service line plugged securely so that extraneous water will not enter the sewer. The owner of the premises or his representative shall notify the public works director of the plug and have the plug inspected prior to covering any work. Before reusing a plugged line, it must first be inspected by the public works director and be in conformity with the existing standards.

DIVISION 3. - BUILDING SEWERS, CONNECTIONS, AND PERMITS 
 
Sec. 30-76. - Installation, maintenance, repair of sewer service lines. 
(a)  Definition. The minimum size of a standard sanitary sewer service line shall be a four-inch pipe. A standard sanitary sewer service line shall extend from the sewer main or trunk location in a street, alley, or easement to the building served by the sewer system. 
(b)  Installation of sewer service lines. 
Gravity. Four inch building sewers shall be laid on a grade greater than one-eighth-inch per foot (at least one percent). Larger building sewers shall be laid on a grade that will produce a velocity when flowing full of at least two feet per second. The slope and alignment of all building sewers shall be neat and regular. The land owner shall be responsible for hiring a licensed plumber to install gravity lines. 
Pressure. The city shall install all pressure lines between the trunk and a grinder pot. The city shall install the grinder pot. The owner shall be responsible for plumbing from the structure to the grinder pot. On new construction the owner shall dig all the ditch required for installation. 
Building sewers shall be constructed only of one of the following approved materials: (1) cast iron soil pipe using rubber compression joints of approved type; (2) polyvinyl chloride pipe with rubber compression joints; (3) ABS composite sewer pipe with solvent welded or rubber compression joints of approved type; or (4) similar materials of equal or superior quality following public works director approval. Under no circumstances will cement mortar joints be acceptable. Each connection to the sewer system must be made at a wye, or service line stubbed out, or in the absence of any other provision, by means of a saddle attached to the sewer. The city must approve the type and manner of all connections. No person may connect to the sewer by breaking into an existing sewer and inserting the service line. 
The building sewer may be brought into the building below the basement floor when gravity flow from the building to the sewer is at a grade of one percent or more. In cases where basement or floor levels are lower than the ground levels at the point of connection to the sewer the owner shall install a check valve or other back flow prevention device adequate to prevent flooding. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the sewer, wastes carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged into the publicly owned treatment works sewer. 
(c)  Cleanouts. A cleanout shall be located five feet outside of the building, one as it taps on to the utility laterally and one at each change of direction of the building sewer greater than 45 degrees. Additional cleanouts shall be placed not more than 75 feet apart in horizontal building sewers of four-inch diameter and not more than 100 feet apart for larger pipes. Cleanouts shall extend to or above the finished grade level directly above the place where the cleanout is installed. A "Y" (wye) and one-eighth bend shall be used for the cleanout base. Cleanouts shall not be smaller than four inches on a four-inch pipe. 
(d)  Fees. All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and inspection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. The city reserves the right to impose a sewer service line charge for every sanitary sewer service line installed where a lateral sewer connection has been provided for use by the applicant. The rate of charge will be established by the public works director. 
Any person constructing lines for a subdivision shall pay an inspection fee of five percent of the cost of constructing the sewer system. They shall sign a comprehensive contract provided by the public works director and shall pay the inspection fee and the capacity fee and post the bond and do the other things required in the contract prior to commencing construction. A sample contract is [available in the office of the city clerk]. 
(e)  Title and maintenance. When a property owner ties into a sanitary sewer service line and pays the appropriate sewer service line fees, the city shall retain ownership of the grinder pump and pot and lines between them and the trunk lines. For gravity systems the city shall own only the trunk line. The property owner shall pay for all repairs and maintenance of the sanitary sewer service line between the user and the trunk line. 
(f)  Location of sewer stub-out. The plumbing contractor is responsible for locating the sewer stub-out, publicly owned treatment works personnel will provide whatever information is available for this purpose. If no "Y" or tee exists within three feet of either side of the location shown on the sewer plats, then a tap will be provided by the publicly owned treatment works when the sewer main is exposed. If a manhole needed for locating a service line has been lost, then the publicly owned treatment works shall be responsible for locating the manhole. 
(g)  Taps on utility sewers. All taps made directly into the city's sewer lines shall be made by sewer maintenance personnel. The plumbing contractor shall excavate to the city's sewer and expose the pipe in preparation for the tap. Only one service line shall be allowed to be installed in a trench. New taps shall be made using a "Y"-type connection. 
(h)  Manhole requirements. A new manhole will be required whenever a sewer service line larger than six inches is needed to tie into the city's sewer. The plumbing contractor shall excavate to the sewer and sufficiently expose the pipe for installation of the manhole. The user's licensed plumber shall install the manhole. The user shall pay for the cost of the manhole and the inspection fee and vacuum test prior to commencing construction. 
(i)  Maintenance of service lines. All repairs and maintenance of the sewer service line to include correction of excessive inflow or infiltration shall be the responsibility of the property owner or user of the sewer. The city shall be responsible for the maintenance of collector lines only up to the point where the owner's service line connects to the city's lines. 
(j)  Methods of installation. The methods to be used in excavating, placing of pipe, jointing, testing, backfilling the trench, or other activities in the construction or repair of a building sewer which have not been described in this section shall conform to the requirements of the building or plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city or to the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and Water Pollution Control Federation manuals. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures must be approved by the public works director. 
(k)  Public safety. All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from potential hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner acceptable to the city. 
(l)  Prohibitions. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, area drains, basement drains, or other sources of surface run-off or groundwater to a building sewer or drain which in turn is connected either directly or indirectly to the sanitary sewer.

(4)  Wastewater containing any element or compound known to act as a lacrimator, known to cause nausea, or known to cause odors constituting a public nuisance. 
(5)  Wastewater causing interference with the effluent or any other product of the treatment process, residues, sludge, or scum causing them to be unsuitable for reclamation, reuse, causing interference with the reclamation process, or causing them to be unsuitable for disposal. 
(6)  Wastewater discharged at a point in the collection system that is upstream of any overflow, bypass, or combined sewer overflow and which may thereby cause special environmental problems or specific discharge limitations. 
(7)  Wastewater having constituents and concentrations which cause an exceedance of the limits in Mt. Juliet Local Limits Operational Division Policy No. 2008-01, referenced at section [30-144]. 
(8)  The capacity of existing sewer lines to carry the anticipated wastewater flow, particularly with respect to any problems, overflows, or overloads caused by heavy rain infiltration. 
(9)  The toxicity of each wastewater shall be evaluated by an appropriate biomonitoring technique to determine if a specific discharge may significantly affect the overall toxic level of the publicly owned treatment works influent. 
The public works director shall establish reasonable limitations, prohibitions, or monitoring requirements in addition to the limits established pursuant to sections [30-139 and 30-144] of this article in the wastewater discharge permit of any industrial user that discharges wastewater violating any of the above criteria, or that has processes that generate wastewater that could violate any of the above criteria, as shall be reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose and policy of this section.

(a)  Applicability. This section provides a method for industrial users subject to the limitation on wastewater pollutants listed in sections [30-144 and 30-145] to apply for and receive a temporary exemption to the discharge level for one or more pollutants or parameters. 
(b)  Time of application. Applicants shall apply for a temporary exemption when they are required to apply for a wastewater discharge permit or renewal provided that the public works director allows applications at any time unless the applicant has submitted the same or substantially similar application within the preceding year that was denied by the board. 
(c)  Written applications. All applications for an exception shall be in writing and shall contain sufficient information for evaluation of each of the factors to be considered by the public works director pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. 
(d)  Review by the public works director. All applications for an exception shall be reviewed by the public works director. If the application does not contain sufficient information for complete evaluation, the public works director shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies and request additional information. The applicant shall have 30 days following notification by the public works director to correct such deficiencies. This 30-day period may be extended by the public works director upon application and for just cause. Upon receipt of a complete application, the public works director shall evaluate it within 30 days and approve or deny the application based upon the following factors: 
(1)  The public works director shall consider if the applicant is subject to a national pretreatment standard containing discharge limitations more stringent than those in sections [30-144 and 30-145] and grant an exception only if such exception is within limitations of applicable federal regulations. 
(2)  The public works director shall consider if the exception would apply to discharge of a substance classified as a toxic substance under regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency under the provisions of Section 307(a) of the Act, or similar state regulation, and then grant an exception only if such exception may be granted within the limitations of federal and state regulations. 
(3)  The public works director shall consider if the exception would create conditions or a hazard to city personnel that would reduce the effectiveness of the publicly owned treatment works taking into consideration the concentration of the pollutant in the treatment works' influent and the design capability of the treatment works. 
(4)  The public works director shall consider the possibility of the exception causing the publicly owned treatment works to violate its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. 
(5)  The public works director shall consider if the exception would cause elements or compounds to be present in the sludge of the treatment works which would prevent sludge use or disposal by the publicly owned treatment works or which would cause the publicly owned treatment works to violate any regulation promulgated by Environmental Protection Agency under the provisions of Section 405 of the Act or similar state regulatory measure. 
(6)  The public works director may consider the cost of pretreatment or other types of control techniques which would be necessary for the user to achieve effluent reduction, but prohibitive cost alone shall not be the basis for granting an exception. 
(7)  The public works director may consider the age of equipment and industrial facilities involved to the extent that such factors affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge. 
(8)  The public works director may consider the process employed by the user and process changes available which would affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge. 
(9)  The public works director may consider the engineering aspects of various types of pretreatment or other control techniques available to the user to improve the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge. 
(10)  The public works director may consider an application for exception based upon the fact that water conservation measures instituted or proposed by the user result in a higher concentration of particular pollutants in the wastewater discharge of the user without increasing the amount of mass pollutants discharged. To be eligible for an exception under this subparagraph, the applicant must show that except for wastewater conservation measures, the applicant's discharge has been or would be in compliance with the limitations on wastewater strength set forth in section [30-144]. No such exception shall be granted if the increased concentration of pollutants in the applicant's wastewater would have significant adverse impact upon the operation of the publicly owned treatment works. 
(e)  Review by wastewater hearing authority board. The board shall review any appeal to a denial by the public works director of an application for an exception and shall take into account the same factors considered by the public works director. At such a hearing, the applicant and the public works director shall have the right to present relevant proof by oral or documentary evidence. The procedure set forth in section [30-296] shall be applicable to such a hearing. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof in an appeal hearing. 
(f)  Best management practices. The public works director or board shall not grant an exception unless the applicant demonstrates to the board that best management practices are being employed to reduce or prevent the contribution of pollutants to the publicly owned treatment works. Best management practices include, but are not limited to, preventive operating and maintenance procedures, schedule of activities, process changes, prohibiting activities, and other management practices to reduce the quantity or increase the quality of effluent discharged and to control plant site runoff, spillage, leaks, and drainage from raw material storage.

(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-218. - Individual wastewater discharge permits. 
An individual wastewater discharge permit shall include such conditions as are deemed reasonably necessary by director to prevent pass through or interference, protect the quality of the water body receiving the treatment plant's effluent, protect worker health and safety, facilitate sludge management and disposal, and protect against damage to the POTW. Individual wastewater discharge permits must contain: 
(1)  A statement that indicates the wastewater discharge permit issuance date, expiration date and effective date. No permit is to exceed a five-year duration; 
(2)  A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is nontransferable without prior notification to the city, and provisions for furnishing the new owner or operator with a copy of the existing wastewater discharge permit; 
(3)  Effluent limits, including best management practices, based on applicable pretreatment standards, local limits, state or local law; 
(4)  Self monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and record-keeping requirements. These requirements shall include an identification of pollutants (or best management practices) to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type based on federal, state, and local law. 
(5)  The process for seeking a waiver from monitoring for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge. 
(6)  A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that required by applicable federal, state, or local law. 
(7)  Requirements to control slug discharge, if determined by the director to be necessary. All SIU permits must contain immediate notification requirements of any changes affecting potential to slug as per 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v). 
(8)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the director must be included as a condition in the user's permit. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-219. - General wastewater discharge permits. 
At the discretion of the director, general permits may be used to control SIU, industrial user, or commercial user discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All facilities to be covered by a general permit must: 
(1)  Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; 
(2)  Discharge the same types of wastes; 
(3)  Require the same effluent limitations; 
(4)  Require the same or similar monitoring; and 
(5)  In the opinion of the director are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge permits. 
a.  To be covered by the general permit, the SIU must file a written request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all wastes covered by the general permit, and any other information the POTW deems appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general permit until after the director has provided written notice to the SIU that such a waiver request has been granted. 
b.  The director will retain a copy of the general permit, documentation to support the POTW's determination that a specific SIU meets the criteria in this section and applicable state regulations, and a copy of the user's written request for coverage for three years after the expiration of the general permit. 
c.  General permits will contain the same required information as listed in section [30-218]. 
The city may not control an SIU through a general permit where the facility is subject to production-based categorical pretreatment standards or categorical pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or for IUs whose limits are based on the combined wastestream formula or net/gross calculations.

Sec. 30-221. - Duration of permits. 
Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a time period not to exceed five years. Permits issued to industrial users pursuant to section [30-186] may be issued for a period of one year. 
Industrial users subject to a national pretreatment standard shall apply for new permits on the effective date of such standards. The public works director shall notify in writing any industrial user whom the public works director has cause to believe is subject to a national pretreatment standard of the promulgation of such regulations, but any failure of the public works director in this regard shall not relieve the user of the duty of complying with such standards. An industrial user must apply in writing for a renewal permit within a period of time not more than 90 days and not less than 30 days prior to expiration of the current permit. 
Limitations or conditions of a permit are subject to modification or change as such changes become necessary due to changes in applicable water quality standards, changes in the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, changes in section [30-144 or 30-145], changes in other applicable law or regulation, or for other just cause. Users will be notified of any proposed changes in their permit by the public works director at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change. Any change or new condition in the permit shall include a provision for a reasonable time schedule for compliance. The user may appeal the decision of the public works director in regard to any changed permit conditions as otherwise provided for in this article. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-222. - Transfer of permit. 
Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific industrial user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation, unless as approved by the public works director. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-223. - Revocation of a permit. 
Any permit issued under the provisions of this article is subject to modification, suspension, or revocation in whole or in part during its term for cause, including but not limited to, the following:

Sec. 30-251. - Inspections, monitoring, and entry. 
(a)  When required to carry out the objective of this article, including but not limited to: (1) developing or assisting in the development of any effluent limitation, or other limitation, prohibition, or effluent standard, pretreatment standard, standard of performance, or permit condition under this article; (2) determining whether any person is in violation of any such effluent limitation, or other limitation, prohibition, or effluent standard, pretreatment standard, standard of performance, or permit condition; (3) any requirement established under this section. 
(b)  The public works director shall require any industrial user to: (1) establish and maintain records; (2) make reports; (3) install, use, and maintain monitoring equipment or methods, including biological monitoring methods when appropriate; (4) sample effluent in accordance with these methods, at such locations and intervals and in such a manner as the public works director shall prescribe; (5) provide such other information as the public works director may reasonably require. 
(c)  Specific requirements under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall be established by the public works director, or the board as applicable, for each industrial user, and such requirements shall be included as a condition of the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit. The nature of any requirement under this provision shall depend on the nature of the user's discharge, the impact of the discharge upon the publicly owned treatment works, the volume of water discharged, and the technical feasibility of an economic reasonableness of any such requirement. 
(d)  The public works director or his authorized representative, employees of the State of Tennessee, and employees of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, upon presentation of credentials: 
(1)  Have a right of entry to, upon, or through any user's premises in which an effluent source is located or in which any records are required to be maintained under this article are located. 
(2)  Have access at reasonable times to copy any records, inspect any monitoring equipment or method required of the user, and sample any discharge which the owner or operator of such source is required to sample. 
(e)  In the event any user denies the right of entry for inspection, sampling, inspecting and copying records, or verifying that a user is not discharging industrial wastes or performing other duties as shall be imposed upon the public works director by this article, the public works director shall seek a warrant or use such other legal procedures as advisable and reasonably necessary to perform the duties of this article. 
(f)  Any user failing or refusing to perform any duty imposed upon the user under the provisions of this section, or who denies the right to enter the user's premises for purposes of inspection, sampling, inspecting and copying records, or other such duties as may be imposed upon the user by this section, shall be deemed to have violated the conditions of the wastewater discharge permit and such permit shall be subject to modification, suspension, or revocation under the procedures established in this article. A user who does not have an industrial waste discharge permit and denies the right to inspect as described herein is subject to having the sewer service in question terminated. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-252. - Reports. 
(a)  Progress reports. No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the public works director, including as a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such a date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the public works director. 
(b)  90-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the publicly owned treatment works, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the public works director a report containing the information described in section [30-213(4)(6)]. 
(c)  Self-monitoring reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall submit to the public works director during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or in the industrial user's permit, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by their permit. In addition, this report shall include a record of average and maximum daily flows. At the discretion of the public works director and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the public works director may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are submitted. 
(2)  The public works director, as applicable, may impose limitations on industrial users employing dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by paragraph (a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. 
(d)  The reports required in this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature and concentration or production rates and mass limits where requested by the public works director, as applicable, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards or industrial permit. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the public works director as alternative standards, the report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measured operation), the report shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable treatment standard. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-253. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  All significant industrial users shall install a monitoring station of a standard design or one satisfactory to the public works director. 
All users who propose to discharge or who in the judgment of the publicly owned treatment works could now or in the future discharge wastewater with constituents and characteristics different from that produced by a domestic premise may be required to install a monitoring facility. 
(b)  Installation. Required monitoring facilities shall be constructed, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of wastewater. If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the publicly owned treatment works, it shall be provided, installed, and operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the user's premises outside the building. The publicly owned treatment works may, however, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street right-of-way with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that right-of-way and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(c)  Access. If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for publicly owned treatment works, State of Tennessee, or Environmental Protection Agency personnel. There shall be ample room in or near such a facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The entire facility and any sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by and at the expense of the user. 
(d)  The industrial user shall be required to design any necessary facility and to submit according to the permit compliance schedule an engineering report, including detailed design plans and operating procedures to the public works director for review in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The public works director shall review the plans and other documents within 30 days and shall recommend any change deemed appropriate. 
(e)  Upon approval of plans and other documents, the industrial user shall secure all building, electrical, plumbing, and other permits required and proceed to construct any necessary facility and establish required operating procedures within the time provided in the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-254. - Sampling and analysis. 
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by Metro, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report submitted to the city. Where the categorical pretreatment standard, local limit, or permit requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the city or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
(1)  Sample collection and analyses. Samples and measurements taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements of this permit shall be representative of the volume and nature of the monitored discharge during a normal production day and shall be taken as follows: 
a.  Be performed on composite and if applicable, grab samples, representative of the total wastewater flow discharged to the POTW with the maximum time interval between samples no longer than 60 minutes. 
b.  Be conducted in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency protocol. The results must be reported to the lowest detectable limit of the methodology. Samples are to be analyzed by a laboratory, certified by Metro Water Services (Nashville, TN) for the required parameters. 
c.  Provide the flow rate for which the results are indicative to the nearest 100 gallons per day. 
d.  Except as indicated in subsection (1)e. below or if designated different in the user's permit, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period, upon approval from the director, may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
e.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
f.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports [40 CFR 403.12(g)(4) and Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(2) and (4)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section [30-220] [40 CFR 403.12(g)(4) and Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(5) and (8)], the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(2)  Sample location. All approved sampling shall be collected from the sample collection point as designated in the industrial user's permit as issued by the city. 
(3)  Test procedures. 
a.  Test procedures for the analysis of pollutants shall conform to regulations published pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Clean Water Act of 1977, under which such procedures may be required. 
b.  Unless otherwise noted in the permit, all pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the city or other parties approved by EPA. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-255. - Dangerous discharge notification. 
(a)  Telephone notification. Any person or user causing or suffering any discharge, whether accidental or not, which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health and welfare or the environment, or which is likely to cause interference with the publicly owned treatment works, shall notify the public works director immediately (within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the discharge) by telephone. In the absence of the public works director, notification shall be given to the publicly owned treatment works employee then in charge of the treatment works. Such notification will not relieve the user from any expense, loss, liability, fines, or penalty which may be incurred as a consequence of the discharge. 
(b)  Written report. Within five days following such an occurrence, the user shall provide the public works director with a detailed written report describing the cause of the dangerous discharge and measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the publicly owned treatment works, fish kills, or any other damage to persons or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(c)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of a contact in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-257. - Notification of hazardous waste discharge. 
(a)  The industrial user shall notify the city (department of public works), the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and type of discharge. Additional notification requirements may apply as required by 40 CFR 403.12(p). 
(b)  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph during a calendar month in which they generate no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 261(e)(2), (f), (g), and (j). Generation of more than 15 kilograms of hazardous waste do not require additional notification, except for the acute hazardous wastes specified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 261.5(3), (f), (g), and (j). 
(c)  In the case of new regulations under Section 3001 of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the publicly owned treatment works of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations, except for the exemption in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practicable and that it has selected the method of treatment, storage, or disposal currently available which minimizes the present and future threat to human health and the environment. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-258. - Notification of changed discharge.

(c)  Damages may include any expenses incurred in investigating and enforcing the pretreatment program or any other sections of the ordinance, in removing, correcting, and terminating any pollution, and also compensation for actual damages caused by the violation to the publicly owned treatment works. The public works director shall assess the expenses and damages incurred by the publicly owned treatment works to clear the obstruction, repair damage to the publicly owned treatment works, and otherwise rectify any impairment caused by the violation. 
(d)  Whenever any assessment has become final because of a person's failure to appeal within 30 days, the public works director shall bill the person responsible for the damage for reimbursement of all expenses and damages suffered by the publicly owned treatment works. If the person responsible refuses to pay, the public works director may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment and seek execution on such judgment. The court, in such proceedings, shall treat the failure to appeal such assessment as a confession of judgment in the amount of assessment. 
(e)  Significant noncompliance includes: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by Section 2 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the city determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of their emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit, or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best management practices, which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

In such action, the public works director may seek, and the court may grant, injunctive relief and any other relief available in law or equity. 
(Ord. No. 2012-75, § 1, 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 30-300. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the public works director finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the public works director or his agent may serve upon the user a written notice of violation (NOV). Within ten days of receipt of the NOV, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the public works director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the NOV. 
(b)  Consent orders. The public works director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time frame also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to paragraph (d) below. 
(c)  Show-cause hearing. The public works director may order any user which causes or contributes to a violation of this article, its wastewater permit, or any order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principle executive, general partner, or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued. 
(d)  Compliance order. When the public works director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article or a permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements deemed reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the public works director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, the public works director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do one of the following: 
(1)  Comply with the order. 
(2)  Take the appropriate remedial or preventive action needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
(f)  Emergency termination of service. When the public works director finds that an emergency exists in which immediate action is required to protect public health, safety, or welfare, the health of animals, fish, or aquatic life, a public water supply, or the facilities of the publicly owned treatment works, the public works director may, without prior notice, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and requiring that certain action(s) be taken as the public works director deems necessary to meet the emergency. 
If the violator fails to respond or is unable to respond to the public works director's order, the public works director may take such emergency action as deemed necessary or contract with a qualified person to carry out the emergency measures. The public works director may assess the person(s) responsible for the emergency condition for actual costs incurred by the public works director in meeting the emergency. 
If the emergency action adversely affects the user, the public works director shall provide the user an opportunity for a hearing as soon as possible thereafter to consider restoration of service upon abatement of the condition or other reasonable conditions. Following the hearing, the public works director may take any such authorized should the proof warrant such action.

a.  Inside the city limits of $1,500.00; and 
b.  Outside the city limits of $2,000.00. 
The tap fee shall be paid before the property is hooked to the sewer system. A separate tap fee is required for each connection to the sewer system. Taps and tap fee payments run with the land. No owner shall be required to pay a tap fee for a connection if a previous owner has paid a tap fee for the same connection and same use. 
(2)  Sanitary sewer tap fees for existing single-family dwellings: 
a.  Which are within the city limits of the city; 
b.  Occupied by the owner as recorded by the county tax assessor; and 
(3)  Multifamily dwelling. The tap fee for multifamily dwellings shall be $1,500.00 per unit for locations within the city limits and $2,000.00 per unit for locations outside the city limits. 
a.  Commercial and industrial. The tap fee for commercial and industrial users shall be calculated by taking the area of the cross section of the new user's water meter tap and dividing it by 0.31 (the tap area of a five-eighths-inch meter), rounding up to the nearest whole number and multiplying the resulting number by $1,250.00. See the following formula: 
 
For example, the tap fee for a one inch tap would be:

Rate change as per City of Mt. Juliet Ordinance 2009-52 effective 11/09/2009 
Commercial and industrial users who exceed 25,000 square feet of heated and cooled structures and who are required to contribute or construct any off-site improvements, extensions, or upgrades to the city sewer system shall be allowed to use 50 percent of their financial contributions as a credit towards the payment of future tap fees for the site served by such improvements. Commercial and industrial users whose approved site plans include at least 25,000 square feet of heated and cooled structures and who are required to advance contributions for the costs of relocation of any natural gas transmission pipeline done in order to facilitate the relocation or improvement of any city or state road or highway, shall be allowed to use 50 percent of said financial contributions up to a maximum of $207,000.00 as a credit towards the payment of future tap fees for the site served by such improvements; provided, however, that such 50 percent financial contribution shall be calculated only on expenditures for which there is no reimbursement to the commercial or industrial user. This is not retroactive and applies from this day forward of passage of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(b)  Nothing in this section shall relieve a property or business owner applying for a sewer tap fee for a new construction from paying the sewer tap fee in a single payment. Existing business establishments are required to pay the sewer tap fee in a single payment. 
(Ord. No. 2013-09, §§ 1, 2, 1-28-2013)  
Sec. 30-366. - Use charges. 
(a)  Quantity based. Use charges shall be based upon units of 1,000 gallons of water delivered to the user. For all persons who pay the base charge, there shall be no use charge for the first 2,000 gallons of water used. The use charge shall be $5.76 for each 1,000 gallons or part thereof in excess of the first 2,000 gallons until modified by the director of finance pursuant to the provisions of the next subsection. Use charges shall be due and payable monthly. Customers who utilize wells or private water supplies who discharge wastewater to the publicly owned treatment works shall notify the director of finance, in writing, and shall meter the waste placed in the system by a meter approved by the director of finance. Failure to so notify the director of finance, in writing, shall be a continuing violation for each day of failure and shall be subject to a fine. 
(b)  Waste characteristics. Waste water exceeding the following characteristics shall bear additional charges set by the director of public works. 
Biochemical oxygen demand (5-day) 	300 mg/l 
Chemical oxygen demand 	600 mg/l 
Suspended solids - 	325 mg/l 
Ammonia-nitrogen - 	30 mg/l 
Oil and grease - 	100 mg/l 
 
(c)  Method of setting use charges. Annually on 1 November of each year the director of public works shall calculate the cost of providing sewer services and calculate a new base charge and a new use charge for the following year. Calculations shall be based on actual costs in the previous fiscal year. The base charge shall be the same as the use rate for 2,000 gallons of waste water. The new charges shall take effect on January 1 of the following calendar year. 
(d)  Constituents of use charge. The user charge will be computed from operating costs and depreciation. The user charge will be the user's share of the costs of operation, maintenance, and replacement for handling its periodic volume of normal wastewater plus the user's share of any bond amortization costs of the city. 
(1)  Operation, maintenance, and replacement user charges. Each user's share of operation, maintenance and repair costs will be computed by the following formula: 
u = 	C t 	(V u ) 
	V t 	
 
Where: 
C u = User's charge for operation, maintenance and repair per unit time. 
C t = Total operation, maintenance and repair costs per unit of time, less costs recovered from surcharges. 
V t = Total volume contribution from all users per unit time. 
V u = Volume contribution from individual user per unit time. 
(2)  Bonded indebtedness charges. Each user's share of bonded indebtedness costs will be based on a schedule which reflects the user's volumetric and waste strength contribution to the system. 
(3)  User surcharges. The surcharge will be the user's proportionate share of the operation, maintenance and repair costs for handling its periodic volume of wastewater which exceeds the strength of biochemical oxygen demand (five-day), suspended solids, or other pollutants in normal wastewater as listed in the section 30-358. The amount of surcharge will be determined by the following formula: 
C s = (B c x B + S c x S + P c x P) 8.34 V u 
Where: 
C s = Surcharge for wastewater exceeding the strength of normal wastewater expressed in dollars per billing period. 
B c = Operation, maintenance and repair cost for treatment of a unit of biochemical oxygen demand (five-day) expressed in dollars per pound. 
B = Concentration of BOD 5 (biochemical oxygen demand - 5-day) from a user above the base level of 300 mg/l expressed in mg/l. 
S c = Operation, maintenance and repair costs for treatment of a unit of suspended solids expressed in dollars per pound. 
S = Concentration of suspended solids from a user above the base level of 300 mg/l, expressed in mg/l. 
P c = Operation, maintenance and repair costs for treatment of a unit of any pollutant which the publicly owned treatment works is committed to treat by virtue of an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit or other regulatory requirement, expressed in dollars per pound. 
P = Concentration of any pollutant from a user above a base level. Base levels for pollutants subject to surcharge will be established by the director of public works. 
V u = Volume contribution of a user per billing period in million gallons based on a 24-hour average for a billing period. 
The values of parameters used to determine user charges may vary from time to time. Therefore, the publicly owned treatment works is authorized to modify any parameter or value as often as is necessary. Review of all parameters and values shall be undertaken at least annually. 
(4)  Commercial, industrial and pretreatment program charges. All commercial and industrial users shall pay all regular charges and a surcharge equal to 43 percent of the standard charges. Industrial users, veterinary and animal care establishments, food preparation business and others suspected of generating waste water with contaminants per liter exceeding the normal contaminants per liter for a single-family home shall be required to pay a separate pretreatment program charge for evaluation of their waste water and pretreatment inspection if necessary. This charge will be based on the user's proportional share of the costs of administering the publicly owned treatment works pretreatment program, which includes costs incurred by the publicly owned treatment works for verification monitoring, analysis, and reporting. Each user's share of the pretreatment program costs will be computed by the following formula: 
u = 	C t 	(V u ) 
	V t 	
 
C u = User's charge for publicly owned treatment works pretreatment program per unit time. 
C t = Total publicly owned treatment works pretreatment program costs per unit time. 
V t = Total volume contribution of permitted industrial users per unit of time. 
V u = Volume contribution from a permitted industrial user per unit of time. 
In cases where a user would otherwise qualify as a residential user but is metered for water service on a meter measuring multi-family dwellings, the director of public works may require, as a prerequisite for extending residential rates, an agreement from all users and or a hold harmless agreement from the owner of the meter to pay the billing collectively from one meter without recourse and may require that any improvements to or alterations of the sanitary sewer service lines for the real property be made in compliance with standards of the City of Mt. Juliet and at the expense of the property owner. 
(5)  Review of operation, maintenance and repair charges. Mt. Juliet shall review at least annually the wastewater contribution by users, the total costs of operation, maintenance and repair of the treatment works, and its approved user charge system. The publicly owned treatment works shall revise the user charges to accomplish the following: 
a.  Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation, maintenance and repair costs among users or classes of users. 
b.  Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation, maintenance and repair costs of the treatment works. 
c.  Apply any excess revenues collected to the costs of operation, maintenance and repair for the next year and adjust rates accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 2013-09, §§ 1, 2, 1-28-2013)  
Sec. 30-367. - Outside city customers. 
(a)  All users who are located outside the city shall pay all regular charges and a surcharge of 25 percent additional for all fees including tap, connection, pretreatment and user fees. 
(b)  The city reserves the right to refuse sewer service to any area outside the city. 
(c)  Any developer or land owner who anticipates undertaking any project outside the city limits of the city which would require a connection to the city sewer system shall first obtain the approval of the city planning commission and the city commission prior to any engineering design work concerning the sewer system. Out of city sewer service application and fee shall be submitted to the public works department prior to any request for service being heard by the city planning commission and city commission. 
(d)  After receiving approvals necessary for the connection, final approval will be granted by the public works director or his/her designee. The developer and the developer's engineer shall work closely with the engineer for the city sewer system during the design, construction and inspection stages of the development. Such systems shall also have the approval of the engineer for the city regarding the as-built system prior to connection. 
(e)  Any developer who fails to obtain such prior approval shall not be allowed to connect to the city sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 2013-09, §§ 1, 2, 1-28-2013; Ord. No. 2017-53, § 1, 9-11-2017)  
Sec. 30-368. - New accounts and sureties. 
All applicants for sewer services shall open an account with the finance department on 2365 N. Mt. Juliet Road. Applicants with no former account with Mt. Juliet shall pay an administrative charge of $25.00 at the time they fill out the application. People who start to use the system without filling out an application shall be charged an administrative charge of $125.00 with their first bill. 
All persons renting or leasing property shall also present a surety agreement from their landlord in substantially the form of Schedule A [which is available in the office of the city clerk]. 
(Ord. No. 2013-09, §§ 1, 2, 1-28-2013)  
Sec. 30-369. - Waiving sign-up fee for sewer activation fee for active duty military personnel. 
(a)  The director of finance hereby has authority to waive the sewer activation fee of $25.00 for an active duty member of the United States Military or National Guard. 
(b)  The person applying for the waiver of the fee must reside at the location that the sewer hookup is being applied for. 
(c)  The person applying must present proper identification and documents as required by the director of finance to verify they are on active duty at the time the hook up is required. 
(d)  The activation fee of $25.00 to hook onto the sewer system is waived. 
(Ord. No. 2013-09, §§ 1, 2, 1-28-2013)  
Sec. 30-370. - Processing fee and other charges for utility customers paying with credit or debit cards. 
(a)  The City of Mt. Juliet is hereby empowered to contract with a third party vendor or will arrange for city sewer service credit or debit cards as the method of payment for monthly and other utility charges. 
(b)  In the event that the credit or debit card company issuing the card does not honor payment of the charge, the city shall collect the same fee that is normally charged for returned checks, and this fee shall be in addition to the normal fee for using a credit or debit card for payment of utility bills. 
(c)  The third party vendor may establish the convenience fee not to exceed 3.5 percent of the payment. 
(d)  Compliance, if required, with TCA 47-10-119, shall be completed prior to implementation and a post implementation review shall be provided in compliance with TCA § 47-10-119.

PREFACE 
    This Land Development Code constitutes a republication of the subdivision and zoning regulations of the City of Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the subdivision regulations, as updated through 5-20-2010, and zoning regulations, as updated through the Ord. No. 2011-36, 7-11-2011. The source of each new section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is part of the original publication. 
    The chapters of this Land Development Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Land Development Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 1-101. - Title. 
    These regulations shall hereinafter be known and cited as the Subdivision Regulations of the Mt. Juliet Planning Region as established by resolution of the Local Government Planning Advisory Committee. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-101) 
Sec. 1-102. - Authority. 
    These subdivision regulations are adopted by the Mt. Juliet Municipal-Regional Planning Commission (hereinafter referred to as "Planning Commission"), in pursuance of the authority and powers granted by sections 13-3-401 through 13-3-411 and 13-4-301 through 13-4-309, Tennessee Code. Having adopted a major street or road plan for the jurisdictional area, and filed a certified copy of the plan with the Wilson County Register of Deeds (hereinafter referred to as "county register"), as required by sections 13-3-402 and 13-4-302, Tennessee Code, and having held a public hearing as indicated in subsection 1-107.1 of these regulations, the Planning Commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in state law as prerequisites to the adoption of these regulations. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-102) 
Sec. 1-103. - Jurisdiction. 
    These subdivision regulations shall apply to all subdivisions, as herein defined, located within the City of Mt. Juliet, and its extraterritorial region as established by resolution of the Local Government Planning Advisory Committee. No land shall be subdivided within the jurisdictional area until the subdivider submits a plat as required by these regulations, obtains Planning Commission approval of the plat, and files the approved plat with the county register. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-103) 
Sec. 1-104. - Policy and purpose. 
    It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Planning Commission to consider subdivision of land and development of a subdivision plat as subject to control of the adopted land use or community development plan (hereinafter referred to as "land development plan") of the jurisdictional area for orderly, planned, and efficient physical and economical development. 
    Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger of fire, flood, or other menace. 
    Land shall not be subdivided until proper provisions have been made for drainage, water, sewerage, other public utilities, roadways, sidewalks, signage and for other required public improvements and services. The existing and proposed public improvements shall generally conform to and be properly related to proposals shown in the land development plan. 
    The regulations herein shall supplement and facilitate enforcement of the provisions and standards contained in the Zoning Ordinance of Mt. Juliet, Tennessee (hereinafter referred to as "zoning ordinance"). 
    These regulations are adopted for the following purposes: 
A.  To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the jurisdictional area. 
B.  To guide development of the jurisdictional area in accordance with the land development plan, considering the suitability of nonresidential and public areas and having regard for the most beneficial land use in such areas. 
C.  To provide for adequate light, air, and privacy; to secure safety from fire, flood, and other dangers; and to prevent overcrowding of the land and undue congestion of population. 
D.  To enhance the character and economic stability and encourage the orderly, beneficial development of the jurisdictional area. 
E.  To conserve the value of land, buildings, and improvements throughout the City and to minimize detrimental conflicts among the uses of land and structures. 
F.  To guide public and private policy and action providing for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, recreational areas, and other public requirements and facilities. 
G.  To provide for the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land and buildings and the efficient movement of traffic throughout the jurisdictional area. 
H.  To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions and resubdivisions; to further the orderly layout and use of land; and to insure proper legal descriptions and proper monumenting of land. 
I.  To insure that public facilities are available and will have sufficient capacity to serve the proposed subdivision. 
J.  To prevent pollution of air, streams, and ponds; to assure adequacy of drainage facilities; to safeguard the water table; and to preserve the integrity, stability, beauty, and value of land within the jurisdictional area. 
K.  To preserve the natural beauty and topography of the jurisdictional area, and to insure appropriate development with regard to these natural features. 
L.  To provide for open spaces through efficient design and layout of the land, including use of average density to provide for reductions in minimum width and area of lots, while preserving the density of land as established in the zoning ordinance. 
M.  To encourage subdivision design which would maximize conservation of all forms of energy. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-104) 
Sec. 1-105. - Interpretation, conflict, and severability. 
    1-105.1. Interpretation. These regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for promotion of health, safety, and general welfare. 
    1-105.2. Conflict with public and private provisions. 
1-105.201. Public provisions. These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control, as determined by the enforcing officer. 
1-105.202. Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or other private agreement or restriction; provided, that where these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards than such easement, covenant, or other private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. Where any private provision exceeds the standards set forth herein, such shall be considered a private contract between the parties of interest, and, as such, is beyond the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission. 
    1-105.3. Severability. If any part or provision of these regulations or application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in the controversy where such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The Planning Commission hereby declares that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations without any such part, provision, or application. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-105) 
Sec. 1-106. - Saving provision. 
    These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or by virtue of prior subdivision regulations; or as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue; or as affecting the liability of any person; or as waiving any right of the governing body under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations; or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person by lawful action of the governing body, except as expressly provided otherwise in these regulations. 
    1-106.1. Previously approved subdivisions. 
1-106.101. Unexpired preliminary approval. The approval granted on any plat prior to the effective date of these regulations shall remain in force and effect for the time period stipulated by the regulations under which the approval was first granted. 
1-106.102. Expired preliminary approval. In any instance where the period of preliminary approval shall have expired with some portion of the subdivision not having received final approval, and the applicant wishes an extension of the preliminary approval, the Planning Commission may: 
(1)  Permit the remaining portion of the subdivision to be constructed and to receive approval under provisions set forth in the regulations whereby preliminary approval was originally granted, or 
(2)  Stipulate that the plat is null and void and that a new plat be presented subject to all laws and provisions of these regulations that are in effect at the time such action is considered. 
In making this determination, the Planning Commission shall consider all pertinent facts available to it. The current state and active pursuit of construction and development activities within the subdivision shall be given due consideration in the course of the Planning Commission's deliberation on this question. 
    1-106.2. Failure to file approved plats. All previously approved final plats shall be filed with the county register's office within one year following adoption of these subdivision regulations. In the event the owner fails to file a plat within the time period stipulated herein the approval shall become void and no building permit may be issued for any lot located therein until action is taken to reinstate the plat. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-106) 
Sec. 1-107. - Amendments. 
    1-107.1. Enactment. For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety, and general welfare the Planning Commission may from time to time amend these regulations. Before the adoption of any amendment to these regulations, a public hearing thereon shall be held by the Planning Commission, as required by Chapters 3 and 4, Title 13, Tennessee Code. 
    1-107.2. Codification and distribution. Subsequent to adoption of any amendment to these regulations, such amendment shall be incorporated into the text of these regulations in the following manner: 
1.  Replacement pages shall be prepared incorporating the new or changed language. Each such new or replacement page shall have the amendment number and shall be dated so as to indicate the date of last revision of the page. 
2.  In Article VII of these regulations, each adopted amendment shall be numbered consecutively and printed on pages separate from any other amendment and in a manner that fully states any language deleted from these regulations and any language added and the place in the text of each such change. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-107) 
Sec. 1-108. - Resubdivision of land, modifications after approval. 
    1-108.1. Amendments to an approved/recorded plat. 
(1)  Major. Changes to an approved or recorded subdivision plat that would affect the layout of any public street, alley, or road (hereinafter referred to as public way) shown on such plat, or area reserved thereon for public use, or if it would affect any map, plan, or plat legally recorded before adoption of any subdivision regulations, such amendment shall be approved by the Planning Commission by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision. 
(2)  Minor. Changes to an approved or recorded subdivision plat, including but not limited to, adjusting lots and lot lines, utility easements, shifting of open space and common areas, and other changes considered by the Enforcing Officer to be minor in nature and that do not create any additional lots may be approved administratively by staff, so long as open space and amenities are not reduced or made less effective, and the overall result is not a substantially new design. The submission of official plats for signing, recording, and for the department record shall be followed as required in this ordinance. 
    1-108.2. Resubdivision of land where future division is foreseen. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land or double the minimum required area for any zoning district in which the lot is located, and the Planning Commission has reason to believe that any such lot(s) will be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the Planning Commission may require that the subdivision and development of such parcel of land allow for the future opening of public ways and the ultimate extension of adjacent public ways or that such lots be restricted from further subdivision through a permanent conservation easement. The Planning Commission may also require that dedications providing for future opening and extension of such public ways be indicated on the plat. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-108) 
Sec. 1-109. - Conditions. 
    Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions to land subdivision are exercises of valid police power delegated by the state to the Planning Commission. The developer has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Planning Commission for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the land so as to provide for physical and economical development of the jurisdictional area and for the safety and general welfare of future plot owners in the subdivision and of the community at large. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-109) 
Sec. 1-110. - Vacation of plats. 
    Any recorded final plat or any part of any recorded final plat may be vacated by the owner of the premises, at any time before sale of any lot described therein, by a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the plat or part of the plat to be vacated. In approving the vacation of plats the Planning Commission shall follow the same procedure for approval of plats. The governing body may reject any such instrument, that abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements, or public ways. Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged, or approved, and duly recorded or filed; the instrument shall operate to void the recorded plat and divest all public rights in the public ways and public grounds and all dedications described in such plat. When any lot or lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein provided only if all of the owners of all lots in such platted area join in the execution of such writing. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-110) 
Sec. 1-111. - Variances. 
    1-111.1. General. If the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, a variance from these regulations may be granted; provided, such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the general intent and purpose of these regulations and provided, further, that the Planning Commission shall not recommend variations unless it shall make findings based upon written evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
1.  Granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare, or be injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood where the property is located; 
2.  Conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property; 
3.  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the specific property involved, a particular hardship (not self-imposed) to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations were carried out; and 
4.  The variance will not in any manner alter provisions of the land development plan, the major street or road plan, or the zoning ordinance. 
Where the Planning Commission concludes that the purpose of these regulations may be specifically served to an equal or greater extent by an alternative proposal, condition, or circumstance, it may approve other variations to these regulations. 
    1-111.2. Procedures. Each and every variance or modification of these subdivision regulations sought by a subdivider shall be specifically applied for in the numerical order of the subdivision regulations, in writing by the subdivider. A separate form provided by the Enforcing Officer shall be utilized to list any variance being requested. This form shall accompany the preliminary plat. Any condition shown on the plat, which would require a variance or modification, shall constitute grounds for disapproval of the plat unless such special application for modification or variance is made. In approving any variation from these regulations the Planning Commission shall state fully in the minutes the grounds for the variation and all of the facts upon which the decision is made. 
    1-111.3. Conditions. In approving variations, the Planning Commission may impose such conditions as in its judgment will secure substantially the objectives, standards, and requirements of the regulations. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-111) 
Sec. 1-112. - Exceptions to residential design standards. 
    The Regional Planning Commission in its sole discretion may approve requests for exceptions to section 4-114, Residential design standards, when they find that the request is not contrary to the below criteria. Exceptions approved by the Regional Planning Commission: 
1.  Will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare, or be injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood where the property is located; 
2.  Promote an alternative design approach that creates a unique theme for the development, while maintaining the intent and purpose of the original requirements; 
3.  Propose the use of comparable materials that meet or exceed the quality of construction required by section 4-114; 
4.  Shall not violate any requirement of the Zoning Ordinance; 
5.  Shall not be approved solely due to financial considerations. 
    All requested exceptions shall be clearly enumerated, and supporting documentation, graphics, material samples, necessary for the Regional Planning Commission to consider the request shall be submitted as required by the RPC. The Regional Planning Commission may adopt procedures requiring an applicant to notify affected property owners of the requested action. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 1-112; Res. No. 2011-01, § 2, 4-21-2011) 
Sec. 1-113. - Enforcement, violation, and penalties.

1-113.103. Recording of plats. Pursuant to Sections 13-3-402 and 13-4-302, Tennessee Code, no plat of a subdivision of land within the jurisdictional area shall be received or recorded by the county register until the plat has received final approval of the planning commission in accordance with these regulations, and such approval has been endorsed in writing on the plat by the planning commission secretary in the manner prescribed by Section 2-105, of these regulations. 
1-113.104. Use of unapproved plats. Pursuant to Sections 13-3-410 and 13-4-306, Tennessee Code, no owner or agent of the owner of any land shall convey such land contrary to the provisions stated herein. 
1-113.105. Public ways and utilities. Pursuant to Sections 13-3-406 and 13-4-307, Tennessee Code, the governing body shall not nor shall any public authority accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any public way, lay or authorize the laying of water mains or sewers, or construct or authorize the construction of other facilities or utilities in any public way located within the jurisdictional area unless such way shall have been accepted, opened, or otherwise received the legal status of a public way prior to the attachment of the planning commission's jurisdiction, or unless such way corresponds in its location and lines to a way shown on a subdivision plat approved by the planning commission or on a public way plat made by the planning commission. 
However, the governing body may override the planning commission as provided in Title 13, Tennessee Code. In case of any state highway constructed or to be constructed within the jurisdictional area with state funds as a part of the state highway system, the submission to the planning commission shall be by the Tennessee Commissioner of Transportation, who shall have the power to overrule disapproval of the planning commission. 
1-113.106. Building permits. No building permit shall be issued for construction of any building or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in violation of any provision of these regulations. Any individual requesting a building permit for a lot located within an established subdivision shall provide evidence that the plat of subdivision wherein such lot is located has been approved and appropriately recorded. 
1-113.107. Access to lots by public way or private easement. Pursuant to Sections 13-3-411 and 13-4-308, Tennessee Code, no building permit shall be issued and no building or structure shall be erected on any lot within the jurisdictional area, unless the public way giving access to the lot upon which the building or structure is proposed to be placed shall have been accepted or opened or shall have otherwise received the legal status of a public way prior to that time or unless such way corresponds in its location and lines with a way shown on a subdivision plat approved by the planning commission, or on a street plat made and adopted by the commission. 
    1-113.2. Penalties for violations. 
1-113.201. Recording of unapproved plats. No county register shall receive, file, or record a plat of subdivision within the city without the approval of the planning commission as required in Sections 13-3-402 and 13-4-302, Tennessee Code, and any county register so doing shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law. 
1-113.202. Use of unapproved plats. Section 13-3-410 and 13-4-306, Tennessee Code, provides that whoever being the owner or agent of the owner of any land transfers, or sells or agrees to sell or negotiates to sell such land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of subdivision of such land without having submitted a plat of such subdivision to the planning commission and obtained its approval as required before such plat be recorded in the office of the appropriate county register, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. The city through its city attorney may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by action of injunction. 
1-113.203. Illegal buildings. Any building or structure erected or to be erected in violation of the subdivision regulations shall be deemed an unlawful building or structure; and the city manager or other official designated by the chief legislative body may bring action or enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed as provided in Sections 13-3-411 and 13-4-308, Tennessee Code.

(i)  Preapplication conference with the enforcing officer including submittal of a scale drawing or survey of the proposed subdivision for preliminary discussion and review. 
(ii)  Submittal of a final plat, prepared, in accordance with the specifications in section 5-104, herein, for review and approval by the enforcing officer. 
(iii)  Two-lot divisions that would create lots significantly different (i.e. size, shape, width, orientation) from the established theme of other lots in the subdivision and that in the opinion of staff would have an adverse impact on the established or intended character of the subdivision, may be referred to the Planning Commission for consideration. 
    2-101.3. Official submission date. For the purpose of these regulations, for both major and minor subdivisions, the date of the regular meeting of the Planning Commission at which the public hearing on the final subdivision plat, including any adjourned date thereof, is closed, shall constitute the official submittal date of the plat at which the statutory period required in section 13-4-304, Tennessee Code, for formal approval or disapproval of the plat shall commence. 
    2-101.4. Policy on floodprone areas. In determining the appropriateness of land subdivision at any site containing a floodprone area, the Planning Commission, in reviewing any plat, shall consider the policy and purpose set forth in section 1-104 of these regulations and, additionally: 
1.  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities, either potential or actual, caused by subdivision fill, roads, and intended uses; 
2.  The danger that intended uses or improvements may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others; 
3.  The adequacy of the proposed water supply, sanitation, and drainage systems, and the ability of these systems to function under flood conditions; 
4.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage upon the individual owner; 
5.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community at large; 
6.  The requirements of the subdivision for a waterfront location; 
7.  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed subdivision and land uses; 
8.  The compatibility of the proposed uses with existing development or development anticipated in the foreseeable future; 
9.  The relationship of the proposed subdivision to the land development plan and the floodplain management program for the area; 
10.  The safety of access to the property for emergency vehicles in times of flood; 
11.  The expected heights, duration, velocity, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; 
12.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, public ways, and bridges; and 
13.  The effect of the proposed subdivision upon the governing body's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, if such governing body is, or elects to be, in the program. 
    No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved by the Planning Commission if proposed levees, fills, structures, or other features within the subdivision will individually or collectively, increase flood flows, heights, duration, or damages. The regulatory limits (the 100-year flood level) shall be determined from the latest approved flood study for the jurisdictional area, and any subsequent revisions thereto. If deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, specific engineering studies are to be formulated by the developer in those areas where flood data are not currently available. 
    In any instance where the Planning Commission determines that a proposed subdivision may affect the flood height, velocity, or duration in any floodprone area outside its jurisdiction, the commission shall take all actions necessary and proper to ensure the coordinated review of the development with the appropriate governmental agencies of the affected area. 
    In approving plans for subdivision of land containing floodprone areas, the Planning Commission shall ensure that development will proceed in such a way that property lying within any floodway, as defined by these regulations, will be maintained in a manner as prescribed by the zoning ordinance and that such commission shall also ensure that development within any floodway fringe area of the floodplain (within the 100-year flood level) will be protected adequately against potential flood hazards by the methods prescribed in Article IV of these regulations. 
The Planning Commission shall disapprove the subdivision of any land containing a floodprone area when the commission determines that subdivision plans are not consistent with the policy stated in this section or that proper safeguards and improvements to these areas have not been proposed. 
    2-101.5. Special provisions governing unit ownership (condominium) subdivisions. 
2-101.501. General provisions. 
a.  Intent. This section is intended to augment the general legislation of sections 66-27-101 through 66-27-123, Tennessee Code, entitled "Horizontal Property Act," by providing supplemental rules and regulations for the implementation of the act, as specifically authorized in section 66-27-121, Tennessee Code. 
b.  Applicability.

2-101.502. Submission of plat required. Prior to sale or transfer of any portion of the land or buildings incorporated in the property regime, the developer, sole owner, or co-owners of such property shall submit to the Planning Commission a subdivision plat of such property in the manner prescribed by this article; such plat, if approved, shall be filed with the county register in the manner prescribed by this article. 
2-101.503. Determination of subdivision type. Condominium subdivisions shall be classified by the Planning Commission during the plat review process as either a horizontal condominium or a vertical condominium as defined in Article VI of these regulations. ;1; 2-101.504. Procedure. An applicant seeking approval of a condominium subdivision shall proceed through the normal procedure for subdivision approval, as set forth in this article. 
2-101.505. Contents of plans and documents. The plats, plans, and documents submitted by an applicant seeking approval of condominium subdivision shall conform to the specifications set forth in Article V of these regulations. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 2-101) 
Sec. 2-102. - Conceptual plan (major subdivisions only). 
    2-102.1. Purpose of conceptual plan. After the preapplication conference, a conceptual plan shall be submitted for all "major subdivisions," (as defined by these regulations). As used in these regulations, the term "Conceptual Plan" refers to a group of preliminarily engineered conceptual documents drawn to illustrate initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for greenery lands, house sites, and street alignments. A major element of this plan is documentation and evaluation of environmental conditions found upon a site. This is the stage where drawings are tentatively illustrated, before significant engineering costs are incurred in the detailed design of any proposed subdivision layout. The objective of this process is to manage each development site in a fashion that will accommodate reasonable use consistent with applicable zoning law while simultaneously protecting, preserving and enhancing the natural environment. 
    The Conceptual Plan shall be prepared by a design team that includes a landscape architect and civil engineer. Such plan shall be submitted by the applicant to the enforcing officer who will then submit it to the Planning Commission for review for the purpose of securing early agreement on the overall pattern of streets, house lots, conservation areas, and potential trail linkages (where applicable), prior to any significant expenditures on engineering costs in the design of streets, stormwater management, or the accurate delineation of internal lot boundaries. 
    2-102.2. Conceptual plan requirements (major subdivisions). The conceptual plan shall include the information set forth in section 5-101. 
    2-102.3. Approval of conceptual plan. When a conceptual plan is submitted for Planning Commission approval, the number of copies required and timing of the submission shall be as for a preliminary plat. Within 60 days of receiving the conceptual plan, the Planning Commission shall approve it, disapprove it, or approve it with conditions, stating its reasons in writing. Approval of the conceptual plan shall constitute authorization to prepare and present a preliminary plat and detailed construction drawings, plans and specifications for the proposed development. 
    2-102.4. Expiration of approval. The approval of the conceptual plan shall expire within one year unless a preliminary plat is filed for all or a portion of the land included within the approved conceptual plan. A one-year extension may be granted if application is made no less than 60 days prior to the expiration date. In the event the conceptual plan expires, such plan shall become null and void and be [of] no further effect. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 2-102) 
Sec. 2-103. - Preliminary plat (major subdivisions only). 
    2-103.1. Purpose of preliminary plat. The preliminary plat is a detailed engineering document. Such plat will reflect results of design decisions that have been made in the process of adapting the general concepts contained within the conceptual plan to the engineering realities required by conditions of the site. Prior to final approval of a preliminary plat and construction drawings, no clearing of trees (with the exception of those required to facilitate surveying activities) or site grading in any form shall be undertaken. 
    2-103.2. Application procedure and requirements. The applicant shall file with the Planning Commission a preliminary plat. Failure of the applicant to satisfy the requirements of this section with full and correct information shall be cause for disapproval of a preliminary plat. The preliminary plat shall be prepared in accordance with section 5-102, and: 
1.  Be presented at the office of the enforcing officer on or before the scheduled deadline as established by the City of Mt. Juliet for consideration at a regular (officially opened) meeting of the Planning Commission. 
2.  Include the entire subdivision, or, when phasing has been approved, section thereof, for which preliminary approval is sought and all land immediately adjacent, extending 200 feet therefrom, or of that directly opposite thereto, extending 200 feet from the public way frontage of such opposite land. The lot pattern of surrounding development shall be shown within that area located within 200 feet of the proposed development; and 
3.  Be accompanied by a minimum of 20 copies of the preliminary plat as described herein. 
    2-103.3. Plat preparation and content. A preliminary plat shall be prepared by a registered surveyor. As a minimum such plat shall contain the information contained in section 5-102 of these regulations. 
    2-103.4. Preliminary design certification. A "Preliminary Design Certification" shall accompany any preliminary plat submitted under authority of these regulations. Such certification shall indicate that the preliminary plat complies with the City's zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, with such exceptions as are specifically listed upon the face of the plat. This certification requirement is meant to provide the City with assurance that the proposed plan can be accomplished within the current regulations of the City. 
    2-103.5. Administrative review. An administrative review meeting shall be conducted on the preliminary plat and any exhibits submitted in conformance with these regulations. This review shall include the enforcing officer and any other appropriate governmental representative(s). The findings of the review committee shall be presented to the Planning Commission along with the preliminary plat. 
    2-103.6. Notice of hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a hearing as required by Chapter 4, of Title 13, Tennessee Code, on each preliminary plat brought before it. 
    2-103.7. Tentative approval. After the Planning Commission has reviewed the preliminary plat, exhibits, and the results of administrative review, the applicant shall be advised of any required changes. The Planning Commission shall tentatively approve (subject to approval of construction plans), conditionally approve, or disapprove the preliminary plat within 60 days after the date of the regular meeting of the Planning Commission at which the hearing on preliminary approval, including adjourned date thereof, is closed. No action of the Planning Commission approving a preliminary plat shall become final until construction plans meeting the specifications appearing in section 5-103 of these regulations, have been approved. 
    2-103.8. Certificate of preliminary approval. Upon approval of construction plans the Planning Commission may act to finally approve the preliminary plat and issue a certificate of preliminary approval. The applicant may proceed to apply for final subdivision plat approval in the manner prescribed by section 2-105 of these regulations. When the secretary of the Planning Commission has signed the certificate of preliminary approval, one copy of the preliminary plat and construction plans with the date of approval noted thereon shall be returned to the developer. If a preliminary plat is disapproved, the Planning Commission shall state specific reasons for disapproval which shall be entered into the minutes of the meeting wherein such action was taken. 
    2-103.9. Infrastructure Improvements Public and Private. Prior to initiating grading within any major subdivision (or portion thereof) or installation of any infrastructure improvements a "certificate of preliminary approval" as required by subsection 2-103.8, shall have been obtained for that portion of the development. The Planning Commission shall require that all infrastructure improvements be installed and dedicated prior to submittal of the Final Plat for consideration by the Regional Planning Commission. The application for the Final Plat shall be accompanied by Development and/or Sanitary Sewer Letters of Credit or other appropriate surety per the City of Mt. Juliet requirements, amounts of which shall be noted on the Final Plat. The form of such surety shall be established by the Planning Commission based upon recommendations of the City attorney and the enforcing officer. Evidence shall be provided that the performance agreement has been executed and the surety established prior to issuance of the "certificate of preliminary approval." The Planning Commission shall require the applicant to indicate on the plat all public ways and improvements to be dedicated; all districts for water, fire, and utility improvements which shall be required to be established or extended; and any other special requirements deemed necessary by the Planning Commission in order for the subdivision plat to conform to the major street or road plan and the land development plan for the jurisdictional area. 
    2-103.10. Validity of preliminary plat approval. 
(1)  General. Except as provided in [subsection] (2) below, preliminary plan approval shall be valid for two years as authorizing the submittal of applications for construction plan approval and final plat approval for the subdivision (if not phased), or first approved phases thereof (if phased), and for five years as (a) authorizing the submittal of applications for construction plan approval and final plat approval for all remaining phases of a phased development, and (b) insulating development of the subdivision from any subsequent changes to these regulations. Preliminary plan approval shall automatically become void if complete applications for both construction plan approval and final plat approval for the subdivision (if not phased), or first approved phases thereof (if phased), have not been submitted to Planning Commission staff within the shorter time period. If applications for construction plan approval and final plat approval are submitted for only part of the approved subdivision within the longer time period, preliminary plan approval for those remaining parts of the subdivision shall automatically become void and applications for construction plan approval or final plat approval for development of the remaining parts of the subdivision site may be submitted only pursuant to a new preliminary plan approval granted in accord with this section. 
(2)  Extension of preliminary plat approval validity. On request by the applicant or owner of the parcel proposed to be subdivided, the Planning Commission may extend the date on which preliminary plan approval would otherwise expire up to 12 months on determining that: 
(a)  The preliminary plan approval has not yet expired; 
(b)  The applicant or owner of the parcel proposed to be subdivided has proceeded with due diligence and good faith to prepare a construction plan and final plat for the subdivision, or approved phases thereof; and 
(c)  Conditions or applicable regulations have not changed so substantially as to warrant reconsideration of the proposed subdivision with respect to public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    2-103.11. Application of changes within land use regulations to approved preliminary plats. Every plat shall conform to all existing zoning provisions and subdivision regulations applicable at the time of proposed final approval, except that any final plat contained within the bounds of a preliminary plat the approval of which remains in effect shall be exempt from any subsequent amendments to such zoning ordinance or these regulations that may render the plat nonconforming as to bulk, use, or development standards. No final plat, shall be approved unless the preliminary plat of the development or affected portion thereof is obtained within the effective period of preliminary approval set forth in subsection 2-103.10, (Validity of preliminary plat approval). 
    2-103.12. Phasing of major subdivisions. A subdivision may be developed in phases provided that: 
(1)  Each phase contains at least six lots, unless shown on a phasing plan approved by the Planning Commission as part of the preliminary subdivision plat after expressly determining that the proposed phasing makes it unlikely that a subdivider would willingly abandon a final phase that contains a required extension of a road or other infrastructure; 
(2)  A phasing plan showing the phases of development and the requirements of these regulations that will be satisfied in each phase is either approved as part of the preliminary subdivision plat; 
(3)  The number of lots and amount of any required open space in the phase and any previously approved phases is at least proportional to the portion of the subdivision site area within the phase(s); and 
(4)  The degree and extent of road, water supply, sewage disposal, stormwater management, erosion and sedimentation control, and other required improvements in the phase and previously approved phases is sufficient to serve or handle all development within the phase(s). 
    The Planning Commission shall determine as part of the tentative preliminary approval of a phased subdivision the extent of the phases and/or other infrastructure/improvements, which require submittals of applications for construction plans and final plat within the two-year validity period for first approved phases of a subdivision per section 2-103.10. The certified preliminary plat shall describe in detail the area and or infrastructure/improvements having two-year valid preliminary approval. 
    The Planning Commission shall require that appropriate development agreements and surety instruments guaranteeing the performance of such agreements, be in such amount as is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer the remaining required principal amount of such surety until the remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing. 
    2-103.13. Effective date of preliminary approval. The effective date of final preliminary plat approval shall be the date of the public hearing on the plat where approval or approval with conditions was granted by the Planning Commission. In the case of conditional approval, all conditions of approval must be met within ten days of the date of the hearing. If all conditions are not met within ten days of the date of the hearing or other time limit as determined by the Planning Commission, the conditional approval shall be deemed in default, and the final preliminary plat shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for reinstatement of approval. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 2-103; Amend. of 5-16-2013) 
Sec. 2-104. - Construction plans (major subdivisions only). 
    2-104.1. Application procedure and requirements. Construction plans may be prepared and presented, at any point in time concurrent with or following tentative approval of a preliminary plat. In no instance, however, shall the approval of a preliminary plat become final until construction plans are approved. Construction plans shall contain the information required by and be prepared in accordance with section 5-103, and: 
1.  Be presented at the office of the enforcing officer; 
2.  Include the entire subdivision, or, (when phasing has been approved in the tentative preliminary plat), the entire section which shall correspond to the territory incorporated within the preliminary plat; and 
3.  Be accompanied by a minimum of four copies of the construction plans as described, herein. 
    2-104.2. Construction plan preparation and content. Construction plans shall be prepared and submitted by a Tennessee licensed engineer engaged in the practice of civil engineering. As a minimum such plat shall contained in section 5-103 of these regulations. 
    2-104.3. Plan review and approval. A plan review meeting shall be conducted for the purpose of assuring a coordinated review of construction plans. This meeting shall include the enforcing officer, City Engineer and any other appropriate governmental representative(s). It shall be the responsibility of this committee to assure that the construction plans are in compliance with the provisions of these regulations, other appropriate City ordinances and sound engineering practice. The committee shall approve or disapprove the construction plans. The plan review committee shall notify the Planning Commission in writing of all actions on plans submitted. In any case where revisions may be required for unconditional approval, such revisions shall be made prior to such notice being forwarded to the Planning Commission. In the event of plan disapproval the committee shall provide notice, thereof, to the submitter in writing. Such notice shall include specific provisions of these regulations and/or other ordinances with which such plans do not comply. 
    2-104.4. Preparation of infrastructure cost estimate. Following approval of the construction plans, an infrastructure cost estimate prepared in a form acceptable to the Public Works Department shall be submitted by the developer to the Director of Public Works. The cost estimate shall be approved by the Director of Public Works and the City Engineer, and shall be the basis for and surety which may be required. 
    2-104.5. Dispute resolution. In the event that a dispute should arise concerning interpretation or application of these regulations to the information contained within construction plans, the Planning Commission shall act to resolve such dispute. The enforcing officer shall present written recommendations and the applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to present supporting data and information with regard to the specific disputed issue. The Planning Commission shall act to decide the issue and its action shall be final, subject to legal review. 
    2-104.6. Changes to approved construction plans. As a result of unforeseen conditions associated with a particular site, changes may be required in approved construction plans. No change shall be implemented and no construction associated therewith shall be initiated until revised construction plans have been submitted to the office of the enforcing officer and approved so as to reflect the proposed change. The enforcing officer, upon written recommendation of the City Engineer, may approve changes that involve minor revisions in the location of utilities, roadways, etc. Changes involving the following conditions shall only be made upon approval of revised construction plans and a revised preliminary plat: 
1.  Any increase in the number of building sites; 
2.  Any addition or removal of a public way; 
3.  Any "significant change" (as determined by the City Engineer) in the approved drainage design for the subdivision; 
4.  Any "significant change" (as determined by the City Engineer) in the approved design of utilities; and 
5.  Any other change determined as significant by the enforcing officer. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 2-104) 
Sec. 2-105. - Final subdivision plat (minor and major subdivision). 
    2-105.1. Purpose of final plat. The purpose of a final subdivision plat is twofold. First, such plat provides the legal instrument whereby ownership of lots may be accomplished. Secondly, final plats constitute a means whereby the person subdividing property may offer streets and other infrastructure for acceptance and maintenance by the public. 
    2-105.2. Application procedure and requirements. A subdivider shall file with the Planning Commission a final plat. The plat shall be prepared in accordance with section 5-104; and: 
1.  Include the entire subdivision, or section thereof, for which final approval is sought; (Note: In any instance where a final plat involves only a portion of the land contained within an approved preliminary plat such sectionalization shall have been approved with the preliminary plat); 
2.  Be accompanied by a minimum of 20 copies of the final subdivision plat as described herein; 
3.  In the case of major subdivisions, correspond with the approved construction drawings and preliminary plat; 
4.  Be presented at the office of the enforcing officer on or before the scheduled deadline as established by the City of Mt. Juliet for consideration at a regular (officially opened) meeting of the Planning Commission; 
5.  Be accompanied by formal irrevocable offers of dedication to the public of all public ways and uses, utilities, parks, and easements, in a form approved by legal counsel, as applicable. (The subdivision plat shall be marked with a notation indicating the formal offers of dedication as shown in Article V, section 5-105, "Form of dedication offer" of these regulations); 
6.  Be accompanied by development agreements and appropriate surety instruments guaranteeing performance of such agreements, if required, in a form satisfactory to legal counsel and in an amount specified in subsection 2-103.9, "Public improvements." The bond shall include provisions that the principal of the bond shall comply with all the terms of the resolution of final subdivision plat approval, as determined by the Planning Commission, including, but without limitations, the performance of all required subdivision and off-site improvements, and that all improvements and land included in the irrevocable offers of dedication shall be dedicated to the governing body free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the premises; 
7.  Be accompanied by written assurance from any utility companies serving the area of the subdivision that necessary utilities will be installed and by proof that the applicant has submitted petitions in writing for the creation or extension of any utility districts as required by the Planning Commission upon preliminary plat approval; and 
8.  Be accompanied, if the final plat contains jointly held open space, recreational facilities, or any portion of the site that is held in common ownership, by the following documentation for approval by the Planning Commission: 
(a)  Plans for improvement and maintenance of the open space or facilities located thereon; 
(b)  Articles of incorporation and bylaws of the co-owners association or other legal entity (where open space or facilities are to be deeded to a co-owners association or similar organization acting on behalf of the joint owners of said property) charged with improving or maintaining the open space or facilities, and declaration of covenants and restrictions pertaining to each and every property within the subdivision; and 
(c)  Declaration of covenants and restrictions pertaining to open space and facilities which assure the continued use of said facilities for the purpose intended, where open space or facilities are to be retained by the developer. 
    2-105.3. Endorsement of notations. The notations and certifications required by subsection 5-104.3 of these regulations, to appear upon the final plat shall be endorsed by appropriate officials and other persons prior to application for final subdivision plat approval, except that the certificate of Planning Commission approval shall be signed at the time specified in section 2-106 of these regulations. 
    2-105.4. Hearing and decision on final plat. The Planning Commission shall hold a hearing as required by section 13-4-304, Tennessee Code, on each final plat brought before it. The Planning Commission shall, within 60 days, after submission of the plat, approve, modify, or disapprove the final subdivision plat by resolution, which shall set forth in detail any conditions to which such approval is subject, or reasons for disapproval. In no event shall the period of time stipulated by the Planning Commission for completion of required improvements exceed two years from the date of final resolution. 
    Failure of the Planning Commission to act upon a plat within the prescribed time shall be deemed approval of the plat, and in such event, a certificate of approval, entitling the subdivider to proceed shall be issued, upon demand, by the secretary of the Planning Commission. The applicant, however, may agree to an extension of the time for Planning Commission review. One copy of the final subdivision plat shall be returned to the subdivider with the date of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval noted thereon. 
    2-105.5. Vested rights. No vested rights shall accrue to any plat by reason of preliminary or final approval until actual signing of the final plat by the secretary of the Planning Commission. All requirements, conditions, or regulations adopted by the Planning Commission, applicable to the particular subdivision or to all subdivisions generally, shall be deemed a condition of approval for any subdivision prior to the time of the signing of such final plat. Where the Planning Commission has required the installation of improvements prior to the signing of the final plat, the Planning Commission shall not modify unreasonably the conditions set forth in the resolution of final approval. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 2-105) 
Sec. 2-106. - Signing and recording of subdivision plat. 
    2-106.1. Signing of plat. 
1.  When a surety instrument is required, the secretary of the Planning Commission shall endorse approval on the plat after the Planning Commission has approved the development agreement and accompanying surety instrument and after all conditions of the resolution pertaining to the plat have been satisfied. 
2.  When installation of improvements is required, the secretary of the Planning Commission shall endorse approval on the plat after all conditions of the resolution have been satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily completed. There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the accepting body as shown on certifications by the appropriate governmental representative(s) and that necessary land dedications and improvements have been accomplished. 
3.  When the conditions of this section are satisfied, the secretary may sign the permanent reproducible original of the subdivision plat. 
    2-106.2. Recording of plat. It shall be the responsibility of the enforcing officer to file the approved plat with the county register's office within ten working days following the date of final signature. The owner of the property or his authorized agent shall pay the appropriate filing fee. Any individual requesting a building permit for a lot located within an established subdivision shall provide evidence that the plat of subdivision wherein such lot is located has been approved and appropriately recorded. 
    2-106.3. Expiration of final plat approval. No rights shall be vested in a final plat approval unless the final plat has been recorded with the Wilson County Register of Deeds within one year following the public hearing whereby the Planning Commission granted approval or approval with conditions on the final plat. If the plat has not been recorded within one year of the public hearing the approval shall be considered in default and the final plat must be resubmitted to the Planning Commission to be reinstated.

Secs. 2-107-2-120. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 3-101. - Improvements and surety instruments. 
    3-101.1. Completion of improvements. Before the final subdivision plat is considered for approval by the Regional Planning Commission and subsequently signed by the Planning Commission officer specified in subsection 2-106.1, (Signing of plat) of these regulations, all applicants shall complete, in accordance with the Planning Commission's decision and to the satisfaction of the appropriate governmental representative, all public way, sanitary sewer, water, stormwater and other improvements, including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision, as required in these regulations and approved by the Planning Commission, and shall offer for dedication such improvements to the governing body free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus dedicated. 
    3-101.2. Performance Surety. 
a.  Infrastructure. The secretary of the Planning Commission shall not certify any plat for recording until the required sureties are posted. No building permit will be issued for any lot unless the Final Plat is recorded. The amount and form of a performance surety shall in all regards be sufficient to guarantee to the governing body, or other agency ultimately responsible for acceptance of the facilities, satisfactory repair and/or replacement of infrastructure damaged during building construction and final pavement topping of all streets when site building meets the requirements of section 4-101.7. Such performance surety shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to legal counsel as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution, as set forth in these regulations. For the purpose of these regulations, performance surety shall mean two documents, these being a performance agreement for Development and for Sanitary Sewer and an accompanying irrevocable letter of credit or cashier's check for each. The performance agreement will stipulate the work to be performed by general categories and the estimated value or cost of each category. All letters of credit issued to the City of Mt. Juliet to secure the completion of subdivision repair, replacements or improvements must have an initial term of not less than two years and shall renew automatically for an additional term of one year, unless the City of Mt. Juliet gives notice to the issuing bank that such letter of credit will not be renewed. All such irrevocable letters of credit, or cashier's check must be issued by a financial institution having an office in the City of Mt. Juliet and must permit the City to draw upon the letter of credit by presenting a draft at such office. All cashier's checks must be nonexpiring. 
b.  Non-public infrastructure. Infrastructure Plans including but not limited to grading and drainage plans submitted to the Planning Commission as part of a site development plan or to city public works staff as part of infrastructure drawings in support of a plan of development shall be subject to the performance surety requirements contained herein including the temporary storage of dirt and/or rock on a portion of the site to support later phases of site development. The amount of the infrastructure surety shall comply with Sec. 3-101.2(a). The amount of the surety for the temporary storage of dirt and/or rock shall be determined by the calculated volume of the temporary storage and the most current unit prices for loading and hauling of said material as determined by the Tennessee Department of Transportation. The purpose of the surety is to insure removal of the material from the site in the event of contractual default by the developer. 
    3-101.3. Temporary improvements. The applicant shall build and pay all costs of temporary improvements required by the Planning Commission, and shall maintain these improvements to a reasonable satisfaction for the period specified by the Planning Commission. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the applicant shall file with the Planning Commission a separate suitable surety instrument for temporary facilities, which shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed. 
    3-101.4. Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the applicant at his expense. Any provisions for reimbursement by the governing body or any other agency shall be stipulated clearly in the provisions of any development agreements. 
    3-101.5. Governmental units. Governmental units to which these surety instruments and development agreement provisions apply may file, in lieu of said agreement or surety, a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to act in their behalf agreeing to comply with the provisions of these regulations. 
    3-101.6. Failure to complete improvements. In those cases where a performance surety has been posted and required improvements have not been repaired, replaced, or installed within the terms of such agreements, the Planning Commission thereupon may declare such agreement and the accompanying surety to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the agreement is declared to be in default. In all subdivisions for which development agreements have been executed and surety instruments guaranteeing performance of such agreements posted, if the improvements are not completed no additional building permits shall be issued for any lot or portion of such property unless and until such facilities are either completed, in accordance with the Planning Commission's decision and to the satisfaction of the governing body, or other agency ultimately responsible for acceptance of the facilities, or new agreements and surety instruments guaranteeing the construction thereof are executed. 
    3-101.7. Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of offers of dedication of public ways, easements, and parks shall be by formal action of the governing body or other agency ultimately responsible for acceptance of the facilities. Such action shall be in the form of a resolution recommended by the Planning Commission to the accepting body. Approval by the Planning Commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply an acceptance by the local government, or other agency ultimately responsible for acceptance of the facilities, of any public way, easement, or other ground shown on the plat. The Planning Commission may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 3-101; Amend. of 7-21-2011; Amend. of 5-16-2013) 
Sec. 3-102. - Inspection of improvements. 
    3-102.1. General procedure. The City may provide for inspection of required improvements during construction. If the appropriate governmental representative finds upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the accepting body's construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for completing such improvements to the required standards. Whenever the cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond the applicant and the financial institution issuing the surety instruments shall be liable severally and jointly for completing said improvements according to specifications. 
    3-102.2. Release or reduction of performance bond. 
3-102.201. Certificate of satisfactory completion. The governing body, or other agency ultimately responsible for acceptance of the facilities, shall not accept dedication of required public improvements nor release nor reduce any performance bonds guaranteeing construction of same until the appropriate governmental representative submits a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed. No such certificate shall be issued until a registered engineer provides the accepting authority certification that the improvements are built in compliance with the approved construction plans. Such certification may include a report provided by an independent testing laboratory as to the compliance of paving with the requirements of these regulations. This report shall include subgrade soil compaction density, mineral aggregate base stone type and depth, asphaltic binder type and depth and asphaltic wearing surface type and depth. Upon such approvals and recommendations, the governing body, or other agency ultimately responsible for acceptance of the facilities, thereafter, may accept the dedicated improvements in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 3-101.7, (Acceptance of dedication offers) of these regulations. 
3-102.202. Reduction of performance bonds. A performance bond may be reduced upon actual dedication and acceptance of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the plat. Only one reduction may be made during the effective period of any bond. In no event shall the surety be reduced below 25 percent of the principal amount prior to final acceptance of all items covered under such instruments. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 3-102) 
Sec. 3-103. - Maintenance of improvements. 
    The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements, including all lot improvements and drainage systems until acceptance of such improvements by the appropriate governmental body. The applicant may be required to file a maintenance bond or other form of surety with the governing body, or other agency ultimately responsible for acceptance of the facilities, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the appropriate governmental representative and in a form satisfactory to legal counsel in order to assure satisfactory condition of the required improvements, including all lot improvements, for a determined period after the date of the acceptance of the public improvements. In no event will the maintenance bond be set below an amount equal to 25 percent of the performance bond. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 3-103) 
Sec. 3-104. - Deferral or waiver of required improvements. 
    The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of final plat approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate, because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to defer construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or other reasons, the developer shall either pay his share of the costs of the future improvements to the governing body prior to signing of the final subdivision plat or post a bond or other surety instrument ensuring completion of said improvements upon demand of the Planning Commission. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 3-104) 
Sec. 3-105. - Escrow deposits for improvements. 
    3-105.1. Acceptance of escrow funds. Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any improvements required by these regulations cannot be performed, the enforcing officer nevertheless may issue a certificate of occupancy upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the appropriate governmental representative for the cost of such improvements; provided, there otherwise is no danger to the health, safety, or general welfare. The surety instruments covering such improvements shall remain in full force and effect. 
    3-105.2. Procedures on escrow fund. All required improvements for which escrow moneys have been accepted by the enforcing officer at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the developer within a period of nine months from the date of deposit and issuance of the certificate of occupancy. In the event that the improvements have not been installed properly at the end of the time period, the enforcing officer shall provide written notice of two weeks to the developer requiring him to install the improvements, and in the event such improvements are not installed properly, in the judgment of the enforcing officer, he may request the governing body to proceed to install or to contract for the installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow moneys are being deposited, the applicant shall obtain and file with the enforcing officer, prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy, a notarized statement from the purchaser(s) of the premises authorizing the enforcing officer to install the improvements at the end of the nine-month period in the event the improvements have not been installed properly by the developer. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 3-105) 
Sec. 3-106. - Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy. 
    Where performance bonds have been required for a subdivision, or any section of a subdivision, and such are determined to be in default, no building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any building in the subdivision or any affected section thereof prior to completion and dedication of the improvements to the appropriate governmental unit, as required in the Planning Commission's resolution of final approval of the subdivision plat. 
    The extent of public way improvements shall be adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
    No building permit shall be issued for the final ten percent of lots in a subdivision, or if ten percent is less than two lots, for the final two lots of a subdivision, until all public improvements required by the Planning Commission's resolution of final plat approval have been fully completed, dedicated, and accepted by the governmental body. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 3-106) 
Sec. 3-107. - Expiration of bond. 
    Should the bond (or surety) lapse or expire for any reason prior to completion of all required improvements no additional building permits shall be issued and the enforcing officer shall take any or all legal action necessary to assure completion of improvements. Only after completion of improvements or posting of a new bond, will building permits again be issued. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 3-107) 
Secs. 3-108-3-129. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS, RESERVATIONS, AND DESIGNS 

Sec. 4-101. - General requirements. 
    4-101.1. Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules, or regulations, including, but not limited to: 
1.  All applicable provisions of Tennessee Law, regulations, or policy; 
2.  Any zoning ordinance, any building and housing codes, and all other applicable laws or policies of the governing body; 
3.  The adopted general plan and major road or street (public way) plan; 
4.  The rules of the County Health Department and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation; 
5.  The rules, as applicable, of the Federal Highway Administration or Tennessee Department of Transportation, if the subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a nonlocal highway; and 
6.  The standards and regulations adopted by all other boards, commissions, and agencies of the governing body, where applicable. 
Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity with the above rules or with provisions set forth in section 1-104 (Policy and purpose) of these regulations. 
    4-101.2. Self-imposed restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the zoning ordinance or these regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto shall be recorded with the county register on a separate form, along with the final subdivision plat. 
    4-101.3. Monuments. Permanent reference monuments of nondegradable material shall be placed in all subdivisions where new streets are to be constructed. All monumentation shall be placed on property corners or referenced to property lines or road alignments. Certification by a licensed surveyor of placement of monuments shall be required. Monuments will generally not be required within minor subdivisions (as defined by these regulations) when the subdivision occurs along existing streets. The Planning Commission retains the right, however, to require monuments within minor subdivisions where flooding or other extraordinary conditions are found to exist. Monuments shall be placed only after all street construction is complete and curbs have been backfilled or drainage ditches cut. Monuments shall be located and set as follows: 
1.  Control monuments. At the discretion of the enforcing officer, a minimum of three permanent control monuments, containing both vertical and horizontal data, shall be located within each subdivision where new roads are to be constructed. Such monuments shall be constructed of concrete not less than 30 inches in length; nor less than four inches square or five inches in diameter; and marked on top with a cross, brass plug, iron rod, or other durable material securely embedded and shall have horizontal coordinates and vertical elevations shown on the final plat. Reference notes (field ties) defining magnetic bearings and distances to the nearest established street line or official benchmark shall be accurately described on the plat. All control monuments shall be located within dedicated right-of-way along curve points or lot lines and within line of sight of one another. All vertical data shall be referenced to the 1929, datum established by the USGS. These monuments are to be placed near the entrance to the subdivision and, if possible within a nonfill area or be affixed to natural rock outcrops. The location of all control monuments shall be described on the final plat with words and symbols that facilitate locating them at the site. 
2.  Internal monuments and lot pins. One monument, for each four lots or fraction thereof located within the subdivision, shall be placed within line of sight of one another. Such monuments shall be placed within dedicated right-of-way, when possible, and shall be located within nonfill areas or affixed to rock natural outcrops. In all subdivisions, lot corners and all lot line breaks shall be staked by iron rods, pipe, or pins at least 18 inches long and five-eighths inch in diameter. 
3.  Along rivers and streams. The lines of lots that extend to rivers or streams shall be monumented in the field by iron pins at least 18 inches long and five-eighths inch in diameter or by round or square iron bars at least 18 inches long. Such pins shall be placed at the point of intersection of the river or stream and lot line, with a meander line established not more than 40 feet back from the bank of the river or stream. At the discretion of the Planning Commission a control monument meeting the specifications of subpart [subsection] (1) above may be required upon any lot affected by the 100-year floodplain of any stream. 
    4-101.4. Character of the land. 
4-101.401. Land unsuitable for development. Land which the Planning Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which would be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of inhabitants of the land and surrounding areas shall be designated as "conservation lands" and may be utilized as provided in subpart [subsection] 4-101.402, (Use of conservation lands). Land included within this category shall be as specified below: 
(1)  Wetlands and land that is generally inundated (land under ponds, lakes, creeks, etc.); 
(2)  All of the floodway and floodway fringe area within the 100-year floodplain, as shown on official FEMA maps; 
(3)  Land with slopes exceeding 20 percent, or soils subject to slumping; 
(4)  Land situated within sink holes and other karst areas; 
(5)  Land under permanent easement prohibiting future development (including easements for drainage, access, and utilities). 
4-101.402. Use of conservation lands. The areas indicated in subsection 4-101.401 (Land unsuitable for development) shall generally be designated as undivided open space, to facilitate easement monitoring and enforcement, and to promote appropriate management by a single entity according to approved land management standards. However, within subdivisions where the gross density is one dwelling unit per 40,000 square feet (or lower) the required open space may be included within individual lots. 
All undivided open space shall be restricted from further subdivision through a permanent conservation easement, in a form acceptable to the City and duly recorded in the office of the county register of deeds. Any lot capable of further subdivision may be restricted so as to prohibit such action. Stormwater management ponds or basins may be located within these areas as may land within the rights-of-way for underground pipelines. 
4-101.403. Protection against flood damage. Where protection against flood damage is necessary, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, flood damage protection techniques may include, as deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission: 
1.  Imposition of any surety and deed restrictions enforceable by the Planning Commission to regulate the future type and design of uses within the floodprone areas; and 
2.  Flood protection measures designed so as not to increase, either individually or collectively, flood flow, height, intensity, duration, or damages, and so as not to infringe upon the regulatory floodplain; 
3.  Installation of flood warning systems; 
4.  The use of fill, dikes, levees, and other protective measures; 
5.  The use of floodproofing measures, which may include: 
(a)  Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement; 
(b)  Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, shutters, or other similar methods of closure; 
(c)  Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures; 
(d)  Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage through walls; 
(e)  Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation; 
(f)  Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures; 
(g)  Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems so as to prevent the entrance of or contamination of floodwaters; 
(h)  Installation of pumps or comparable facilities for subsurface drainage systems to relieve external foundation wall and basement flood pressures; 
(i)  Building design and construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or floating debris; 
(j)  Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm drains which permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and stormwater into buildings or structures; 
(k)  Location and installation of all electrical equipment, circuits, and appliances so that they are protected from inundation by the regulatory flood; 
(l)  Location of storage facilities for chemicals, explosives, buoyant material, flammable liquids, or other toxic materials which would be hazardous to public health, safety, and welfare at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, or design of such facilities to prevent flotation of storage containers or damage to storage containers which could result in the escape of toxic materials. 
The acceptability of any flood protection methods formulated by the subdivider or his agent shall be determined by the Planning Commission, which shall be guided by the policies set forth in section 1-104 and subsection 2-101.4 of these regulations. 
    4-101.5. Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision within Wilson County. The Planning Commission shall have authority to designate the name of the subdivision, which shall be determined at conceptual or preliminary plat approval. 
    4-101.6. Authorization to construct improvements. Construction may proceed upon approval of the preliminary plat, construction plans and the development agreement. 
    4-101.7. Maintenance of improvements. Generally, the final paving course shall not be applied until 75 percent of the structures within a subdivision, or portion thereof encompassed by an approved preliminary plat, are complete. However, when an undue hardship is created by disallowing the final paving of a street prior to construction of 75 percent, but not less than 50 percent, of the structures within a subdivision, the enforcing officer may permit final paving to occur and the City may allow the subsequent release of the performance bond provided a maintenance bond is substituted therefor. The City may permit the maintenance bond to be renewed if additional time is needed to complete further buildout of the subdivision. The maintenance bond may be released after a period of one year or when at least 75 percent of the subdivision lots have been satisfactorily completed, inspected and released by the inspecting departments. The maintenance bond shall be in an amount and for a term as recommended by the enforcing officer and shall be posted in conformance with the procedures presented in Article III of these regulations. Under no circumstances shall final paving occur until all utility installations, including service lines to individual lots are complete. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-101) 
Sec. 4-102. - Lot requirements. 
    4-102.1. Lot arrangement. 
4-102.101. General. Each lot shall contain a sufficient "building site" (See definition) such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography, slope/foundation stability, flood hazards, or other conditions in locating the structures upon such lot. Building sites shall have dimensions and area sufficient to ensure that the building setbacks and yards are in compliance with any zoning ordinance. No "building site" may include any land defined as "unsuitable for development" by the provisions of subsection 4-101.401 (above). 
4-102.102. Evaluation criteria. In evaluating the layout of lots and open space the following criteria will be considered by the Planning Commission as indicating design appropriate to the site's natural, historic, and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of these regulations. Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas. Accordingly, the Planning Commission shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed plan: 
1.  Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from clearing, grading, filling, or construction (except as may be approved by the City for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities). 
2.  Preserves and maintains mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures, meadows, and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses. For example, locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended, with two exceptions. The first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands that raise an equal or greater preservation concern, as described in Items No. [subsections] 5 and No. 8, below. The second involves predominantly agricultural areas, where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat. 
3.  If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of a field, as seen from existing public roads. Other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads, such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers (specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow). 
4.  Maintains and/or creates watershed and drainageway buffers of natural native species vegetation adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds as follows: 
(a)  100-foot-wide watershed buffers shall be created and/or maintained around bodies of water supply impoundments, measured perpendicular to the shoreline of the water supply impoundment. Watershed buffers shall extend 100 feet from the flood pool elevation of the water supply impoundment, inside the watershed draining to the impoundment. 
(b)  50-foot-wide watershed buffers shall be created and/or maintained around water impoundments, other than water supply impoundments, with a drainage area of 25 or more acres. Watershed buffers shall be measured perpendicular to the shoreline and shall extend 50 feet from the normal pool elevation of the water impoundment, inside the watershed draining into that impoundment. 
(c)  30-foot-wide watershed buffers shall be created and/or maintained around water impoundments draining at least five acres, but less than 25 acres. Buffers shall be measured perpendicular to the shoreline and shall extend 30 feet from the normal pool elevation of the water impoundment, inside the watershed draining into that impoundment. 
(d)  Drainageway buffers shall be created and/or maintained on each side of a stream that is shown as a perennial stream on the most recent version of the USGS 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or has a drainage area of 40 or more acres. The width of the drainageway buffer shall be a minimum of 50 feet wide for flat lying areas. The drainageway buffer shall be increased two feet in width for every one percent of slope increase (measured along a line perpendicular to the stream bank. 
(e)  Drainageway buffers shall be created and/or maintained along each side of a watercourse, channel, ditch or similar physiographic feature. The width of said buffer shall be determined as follows: 
(i)  30 feet in width if the area of the watercourse, channel, ditch or similar physiographic feature is at least 25 acres, but less than 40 acres. 
(ii)  The drainageway buffer shall be a minimum of 25 feet wide if the drainage area of the watercourse, channel, ditch or similar physiographic feature is at least five acres, but less than 25 acres. 
5.  Designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows, and minimizes impacts on large woodlands, (greater than five acres), especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat, or those not degraded by invasive plants. Also, woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than ten percent should be avoided. However, woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development. When any woodland is developed, great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas (for building, roads, yards, septic disposal fields, etc.) in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable. 
6.  Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen from public thoroughfares. For example, in open agrarian landscapes, a deep "no-build, no-plant" buffer is recommended along the public thoroughfare where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant. The concept of "foreground meadows," with homes facing the public thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse (as illustrated in Figure 5-5, of Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide to Creating Open Space Networks) is strongly preferred to mere buffer strips, with or without berms or vegetative screening. In wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a deep "no-build, no-cut" buffer should be respected, to preserve existing vegetation. 
7.  Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. 
8.  Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological, or cultural value, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature, including stone walls, spring houses, barn foundations, cellar holes, earthworks, and burial grounds. 
9.  Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting directly onto existing public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerows, etc. 
10.  Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac islands, and both sides of new streets with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value. These trees shall generally be located between the sidewalk or footpath and the edge of the street, within a planting strip not less than five feet in width. 
11.  Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations that offer convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby house lots. 
12.  Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable). 
13.  Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous, and whose configuration is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the Design and Management Handbook for Preservation Areas, produced by the Natural Lands Trust. To the greatest extent practicable this land shall be designed as a single block with logical, straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails. The open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels (such as in other subdivisions, public parks, or properties owned by or leased to private land conservation organizations). Such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of large contiguous and integrated greenway systems, as per the policies in the open space, recreation, and environmental resources element of the City's comprehensive plan. 
4-102.103. Lots subject to flood. No portion of a "building site" (see definition) associated with any residential structure may be located in any floodprone area. However, portions of lots occupied by residential structures that are located beyond a "building site" may contain land subject to flooding. In any instance where the lot is served by subsurface sewage disposal the area of the disposal fields shall not lie within any floodprone area. Adding fill material within the 100-year flood boundary area will not be permitted unless approved by the Planning Commission. In the event that filling within the flood boundary is approved, the fill shall be protected against erosion by riprap, vegetative cover, or other methods deemed acceptable by the Planning Commission. On nonresidential building sites outside a 100-year flood boundary the use of structural floodproofing methods specified in subsection 4-101.403, (Protection against flood damage) of these regulations, as an alternative to fill material, may be approved by the Planning Commission, as provided in subsection 2-101.4 of these regulations. 
4-102.104. Lots with building sites located on steep slopes. Due to the potential threat to health and safety posed by development located on lands with slopes in excess of 15 percent, the following regulations shall apply: 
a.  Site development plan required. No building permit may be issued for a building or any lot where the proposed building site lies on natural slopes of 20 percent or greater. For any lot where the proposed building site has slopes of less than 20 percent but 15 percent or greater a site plan meeting the following requirements must be approved by the Planning Commission prior to issuance of a building permit. Said site plan shall show: 
(i)  The exact size, shape, and location of the lot; 
(ii)  The proposed location of all buildings, driveways, drainageways, and utilities; 
(iii)  Proposed contours at vertical intervals of no more than five feet; 
(iv)  The extent of natural tree cover and vegetation; 
(v)  The location of any on-site soil absorption sewage disposal systems; 
(vi)  The type and location of erosion control facilities; 
(vii)  The stamp of the Tennessee registered engineer who prepared the plan; 
(viii)  Certification by a Tennessee registered civil or geotechnical engineer as to the stability of the structures and compliance with sound construction methods for areas with steep slopes and landslide problems. 
b.  Site development standards. The following standards shall be used as a guide in determining the suitability of the construction proposed for the particular site in question. The engineer's certification required in subsection 4-102.103a(viii), above, shall address these standards. 
(i)  Natural vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible; 
(ii)  Natural drainageways and systems shall be maintained, except that surface water may be diverted around a house or slope area to a natural drain using acceptable construction techniques; 
(iii)  Operations that increase loads, reduce slope support, and cause instability of the slope shall be prohibited to the maximum extent possible. These methods include filling, irrigation systems, accessory buildings, and on-site soil absorption sewage disposal systems; 
(iv)  Where sanitary sewers are not available all on-site sewage disposal systems shall be shown on the site plan and located to avoid slide-prone areas. Said system shall be approved by the county health department taking into account these requirements; 
(v)  Erosion control measures shall be employed to prevent soil from leaving the site. Additionally, soil from excavation on the site shall not be deposited as fill on a potential slide area; 
(vi)  No construction that would cut the toe of the slope shall be permitted. This shall apply as well to subdivision roads constructed in compliance with these regulations. 
4-102.105. Design requirements for flag lots. Flag lots may be approved in single-family zoned areas following consideration by the approving authority for the City of Mt. Juliet. Flag lots shall comply with the following design requirements: 
(1)  The "pole" may at no point along its length be less than the minimum lot width required for the applicable zoning district. 
(2)  The "front" setback for the flag lot shall be measured from the property line existing in front of the proposed dwelling on the flag lot (the rear line of the lot with frontage on the public street) and shall be the lesser of twice the normal front setback for the zoning district or 75 feet, but in no case less than 75 feet. 
(3)  Flag lots are discouraged for any parcel less than four acres in area. Lot divisions creating a flag lot shall not result in the creation of any lot of less than two acres. The area of the "pole" may be included in the gross area of the site, but shall not be included in calculations for building coverage or setbacks. 
(4)  Depending on the size of the original parcel, a lot split should result in a division that produces two equitably sized lots, avoids 90-degree angles and preferably connects the street with the rear lot line. 
(5)  Buildable area (area excluding required setbacks) on the flag lot and/or front lot, may be required to exceed the minimum setback requirements of the zoning ordinance to provide visibility of dwellings from the street and to avoid "stacking." 
(6)  Flag lots may not be used as a means of avoiding the requirement for extending new public roads or utilities to home sites/lots. 
(7)  An "all-weather" surface, a minimum of 12 feet in width, shall be provided on a flag lot granting access to within 150 feet of the dwelling. The maximum width of a driveway shall be 20 feet. 
(8)  A mailbox, or other structure, shall be required along the right-of-way of a flag lot which clearly displays the address to the public road. No other improvements or structures, other than landscaping shall be permitted within the "flag" area. 
(9)  Compliance with the above requirements shall not guarantee the approval of a requested division of land. Requests meeting the criteria in this policy shall only be allowed at the full discretion of the Planning Commission, or staff when allowed by administrative review. 
    4-102.2. Lot dimensions. Except as provided in subsection 4-102.3 (Special building separation) minimum dimensions of lots shall comply with the standards of the zoning ordinance. All building setbacks shall be indicated for each lot shown on the plat. Where lots are more than double the minimum area required by the zoning ordinance, the Planning Commission may require that such lots be restricted to prevent further resubdivision or be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future public ways where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the zoning ordinance and these regulations. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback requirements from both public way rights-of-way. The minimum lot frontage on a public way shall be 50 feet, except for the radius of a cul-de-sac that shall be 35 feet. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated as established in the zoning ordinance. 
    4-102.3. Special building separation. In all instances where fire flows are inadequate to meet the requirements of these regulations or no fire hydrant is located within sufficient distance to meet the fire protection standards established herein, the minimum separation of principal buildings shall at all points be 50 feet. 
    4-102.4. Building setbacks from high voltage electric lines. In the case of electric transmission lines where easement widths are not definitely established, a minimum building setback line from the center of the transmission line shall be established as follows: 
Voltage of Line Building Setback 7.2 KV 15 feet 13 KV 25 feet 46 KV 371/2 feet 69 KV 50 feet 161 KV 75 feet  
    4-102.5. Double frontage lots and access to lots. 
4-102.501. Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided, except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
4-102.502. Access from arterial or collector public ways. The Planning Commission may require that lots shall not derive access exclusively from arterial or collector public ways. Where driveway access from such public ways may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the commission may require that the lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards. Driveways shall be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back onto arterial or collector streets. 
4-102.503. Minimum clearance. The minimum corner clearance between proposed new driveways and arterial or collector routes designated in the major thoroughfare plan shall be 50 feet. In order to ensure adequate storage space for vehicles stopped at a signalized intersection, the Planning Commission may require that the nearside corner clearance shall be at least 100 feet. Corner clearances and design of driveway connections to arterial and collector roads shall be as defined in the Rules and Regulations for Constructing Driveways on State Highway Rights-of-Way, adopted by the Tennessee Department of Highways April 3, 1967, including all subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto. The distance between a frontage property line and the tangent projection of the nearest edge of each nonresidential driveway, measured along the edge of the public way, shall be at least 15 feet. 
4-102.504. Design standards for nonresidential driveways. For access to thoroughfares where the posted speed limit is 35 mph or less, all nonresidential driveways shall be constructed with a minimum return radius of 15 feet and a minimum horizontal width of 25 feet. All drives serving nonresidential property shall be paved with concrete or an asphaltic surface. 
For access to thoroughfares where the posted speed limit is 40 mph, nonresidential driveways shall be constructed with: 
a.  A minimum return radius of 15 feet and a minimum driveway width of 35 feet; or 
b.  A minimum return radius of 20 feet and a minimum driveway width of 30 feet; or 
c.  A minimum return radius of 25 feet and a minimum driveway width of 25 feet. 
For access to thoroughfares where the posted speed limit is 45 mph, nonresidential driveways shall be constructed with a right-turn deceleration lane and: 
a.  A minimum return radius of 25 feet and a minimum driveway width of 40 feet; or 
b.  A minimum return radius of 30 feet and a minimum driveway width of 30 feet. 
The Planning Commission will review proposed driveway designs for access to other thoroughfares on a case-by-case basis. The centerline of every nonresidential two way driveway shall intersect the centerline of the public way at an angle between 75 and 90 degrees. For other nonresidential driveways, the intersection angle shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission. 
4-102.505. Design standards for residential driveways. Where permitted, residential driveways fronting collector and arterial routes designated in the major thoroughfare plan shall be designed so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back onto these highways. 
4-102.506. Relationship to state standards. Where the driveway design and location standards listed above are not in conformance with the standards of the Tennessee Department of Transportation, the Planning Commission may require conformance with whichever standard is more restrictive. 
    4-102.6. Soil preservation, grading, erosion control, and seeding. 
4-102.601. Soil preservation and final grading. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the approved construction plan. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide cover on the lots. Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site. Soil stabilization shall also be applied within 15 days to denuded areas that may not be at final grade. 
4-102.602. Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings. Drainage of individual lots shall be coordinated with the existing or proposed general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of stormwater from each lot to adjacent lots, except within drainage easements or street rights-of-way. Surface water drainage patterns for each and every lot shall be shown on the road and drainage plans. Drainage flow and conveyance arrows shall be indicated on the topographic grading and drainage plan. It shall be the responsibility of the builder of any building or other structure to design and construct a suitable drainage scheme that will convey surface water, without ponding on the lot or under the building, to the drainage system constructed within the subdivision. The Planning Commission reserves the right to require that the developer set minimum elevations on all floors, patios, and building equipment. This prerogative to establish elevation exists in addition to any ordinances or provision of these regulations that refer to floodplain elevation requirements. This provision is intended to give the Planning Commission summary review powers over any calculated or historical evidence of stormwater presence in overland or channel conditions. All finished floor elevations, driveways, sidewalks and roadways shall be at an elevation at least two feet above the 100-year regulatory flood elevation when located within a floodplain area. The subdivision developer will insure that all artesian groundwaters of a permanent or temporary nature encountered within the right-of-way will be intercepted and carried away to primary drainage conduits along swale ditches or in underground pipes located on property line easements. Regardless of the location of property lines, intercept will be allowed at the point of artesian surfacing. Any sinkhole or natural channel which serves or has served as a means of moving or storing groundwater, including all designated floodways, shall be designated conservation easements and no structures, fill or development activity shall be permitted thereon. 
4-102.603. Erosion and sediment control. There shall be a minimization of changes in the rate of natural erosion and sedimentation that result from the development process. An erosion and sediment control plan shall be presented with the construction plans submitted in conformance with section 5-103 of these regulations. Such plans shall incorporate the following principles: 
a.  Clearing and grading shall be integrated with layout design; 
b.  Clearing shall be minimized and existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum feasible degree; 
c.  Grading shall be strictly limited to those areas located within the "building site" (see definition) along with the driveway of the lot; 
d.  Disturbed areas shall be protected and stabilized as provided in subsection 4-102.601; 
e.  Structural and vegetative measures to control the velocity and volume of runoff shall be required; 
f.  Sediment basins and traps shall be required as necessary; 
g.  Adequate maintenance of all planting and structural measures shall be assured. 
All properties adjacent to the site of land disturbance shall be protected from sediment disposition. This may be accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land disturbance; by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters, dikes or sediment basins; or by a combination of such measures. 
    4-102.7. Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, construction debris, junk, rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land left on any lot or deposited in any natural drainageway (such as sinkholes, underground streams or channels, or wet weather streambeds or floodways) or public way at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the lot, and removal of such waste shall be required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy. Neither shall any such waste be left nor deposited in any area of the subdivision at any time. Debris dumpsters shall be required for construction debris disposal. Such dumpsters shall be of adequate size and shall be removed in a timely manner. No debris burning of any type shall be allowed within the subdivision. 
    4-102.8. Fencing. Each subdivider or developer shall be required to furnish and install all fences wherever the Planning Commission determines that a hazardous condition exists. Such fences shall be constructed according to standards established by the Planning Commission, as appropriate, and shall be noted on the final plat as to height and required materials. 
    4-102.9. Water bodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, such area shall be within jointly held open space. The Planning Commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not become a governmental responsibility. 
    No portion of the minimum area of a lot required under any zoning ordinance may be satisfied by land which is under water. Where a watercourse separates a buildable area of a lot from the public way to which such lot has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert of adequate overflow size or other structure approved by the Planning Commission. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a structure on such a lot until the installation is completed and approved by the Planning Commission and/or the appropriate governmental representative. 
    4-102.10. Blocks. 
a.  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be permitted in blocks adjacent to major public ways, railroads, or waterways. 
b.  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
(i)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
(ii)  Any zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; 
(iii)  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic; and 
(iv)  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
c.  Block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 1,200 feet, except as the Planning Commission deems necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of the public way pattern. Wherever practicable, blocks along arterial or collector routes shall not be less than 800 feet in length. 
d.  Blocks designed for industrial or commercial uses shall be of such length and width as may be deemed suitable by the Planning Commission. 
e.  In any long block, the Planning Commission may require the reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage, facilities, and/or pedestrian traffic. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-102) 
Sec. 4-103. - Streets and pedestrian ways. 
    4-103.1. Pedestrian ways. 
4-103.101. Sidewalks along new streets. Sidewalks shall be required along all "urban" streets (see table 1) [in subsection 4-104.4] constructed in all subdivisions except those proposed for industrial use. Sidewalks may not be required along streets designated as "rural" when all lots fronting such streets are 40,000 square feet or larger in size and have average road frontage of 150 feet or more. 
4-103.102. Sidewalks along existing streets. Sidewalks may be required along an existing public street when sidewalks presently exist upon property that directly adjoins the proposed subdivision, are included within a plan for pedestrian ways or the reconstruction of the existing street is required by an approved traffic impact study. 
4-103.103. Location of sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all streets designated as "residential access lanes or urban residential access streets." Along streets designated as "urban residential collector or community collector streets" sidewalks shall be required along both sides. Transition of sidewalks from one side of a street to another may be permitted when topography makes continuation along the same side of the street impractical. Transitions shall only be made at street intersections. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nontrafficway portion of the right-of-way of all public ways. Concrete curbs are required for all public ways where sidewalks are to be constructed. A median strip of grassed or landscaped area at least two feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs, except within ten feet of intersections no grass strip will be required. No sidewalk shall be constructed closer than one foot from any lot line. Sidewalk construction details shall be shown in appendix B of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 16-2286, 10-15-2015) 
4-103.104. Sidewalk width. The width of sidewalks shall be as follows. Width shall be exclusive of encroachments such as utility poles, fire hydrants, parking meters, sign standards, street furniture, etc. 
Sidewalk Width Street Classification Land Use Classification Residential Commercial Industrial Access lane 5 feet N/A N/A Access street 5 feet 5 feet N/A Residential collector 5 feet N/A N/A Community collector 5 feet 6 feet 6 feet Arterial public way 5 feet 6 feet 6 feet  
4-103.105. Alternative pedestrian ways. Within PUD districts and developments approved under section 5-104.3, Variable lot residential developments, cluster subdivisions, of the zoning ordinance, the Planning Commission may approve pedestrian walkways at locations other than along the rights-of-way of streets. Within these developments a system of pedestrian walkways may be located within commonly held open space. 
4-103.106. Pedestrian accesses. Where necessary, pedestrian accessways may be required from a public way to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other nearby public ways. To accomplish this purpose, the Planning Commission may require perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width. 
    4-103.2. Street standards. The following standards shall apply to all streets, both public and private: 
4-103.201. Frontage on improved public ways. No subdivision shall be approved, unless the area to be subdivided shall meet the access requirements set forth in subsection 1-112.107, (Access to lots by public way or private easement) of these regulations. If any new street construction is proposed, all construction shall be in accordance with the provisions of these regulations and accompanying appendices. 
4-103.202. Grading and improvement plan. No clearing, grading or construction of streets shall begin until construction plans have been prepared in accordance with the specifications required herein and approved. Following approval of such plans, public ways shall be graded and improved to conform to the approved construction plans. 
4-103.203. Improvements in floodable areas. The finished elevation of proposed public ways subject to flood shall be no less than two feet above the regulatory flood protection elevation. To determine compliance with this requirement the Planning Commission shall require profiles and elevations of public ways subject to flood. All drainage structures shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows without increasing flood height. Where fill is approved by the Planning Commission to bring the finished elevation of any public way to the required elevation, such fill shall not encroach upon a floodway, and the fill shall be protected against erosion by riprap, vegetative cover, or other methods deemed acceptable by the Planning Commission. 
4-103.204. Topography and arrangement. 
a.  All public ways shall be arranged so as to obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above the grades of the public ways. Grades of public ways shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall not be permitted. 
b.  All public ways shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of public ways and dedicated rights-of-way as established on the major road plan or the land development plan. 
c.  All public ways shall be properly related to special traffic generators, such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping areas or centers; of population density; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land use. 
d.  In commercial and industrial developments, public ways and other access routes shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, pedestrian walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of movement among the various types of traffic, including pedestrian traffic. 
4-103.205. Access to arterial and collector routes. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector route, the Planning Commission may require that access to such public way be limited by: 
a.  The configuration of subdivision lots so that such lots derive vehicular access from streets other than the arterial or collector route; 
b.  A series of cul-de-sac, "U" shaped public ways, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel public way; or 
c.  A marginal access or service public way, separated from the arterial or collector route by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points; 
d.  Dual points of access in subdivisions. Two points of access to an arterial or collector street shall be required for all residential developments consisting of 100 or more lots and units. The second point of access may connect to adjacent developments as long as the adjacent development has direct access to an arterial or collector street. The Planning Commission may waive this requirement if site conditions tied to the land prohibit a second point of access, provided that a traffic impact study is supplied by the applicant that demonstrates that an adequate and safe level of service can be met. All traffic studies are subject to review by staff and/or an independent professional to determine if recommendations are consistent with the City of Mt. Juliet's transportation programs and needs. 
4-103.206. Traffic impact study. Any subdivision containing lots for 100 or more dwelling units shall be required to prepare at the expense of the developer or individual proposing the subdivision a traffic impact study. At the discretion of the Director of Public Works, any subdivision may be required to prepare a traffic impact study. A Tennessee licensed traffic engineer shall prepare such study in accordance with standard practices and procedures. The traffic study is intended to provide information as to current and proposed or projected traffic levels along all streets touching, immediately abutting or directly impacted by the subdivision. Prior to development of the study, the applicant and/or the individual selected by the developer to prepare the study shall meet with the Director of Public Works for purposes of establishing scope and design parameters to be used in preparing such study. Any improvements proposed to offset the traffic impact of the subdivision shall be indicated. 
4-103.207. Reserve strips. Creation of reserve strips adjacent to a proposed public way in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such public way shall generally not be permitted. However, where in the opinion of the Planning Commission the use of a reserve strip would protect the public safety by providing a safer roadway configuration or other element of design that is clearly in the public interest, this prohibition may be waived. In any instance where a waiver to this provision is granted the grounds, for and extent of such waiver shall be noted in the minutes of the Planning Commission meeting where such waiver is approved. 
4-103.208. Street name, regulatory and warning signs. 
a.  Public streets. Within all subdivisions the developer shall purchase and install street name and traffic control signs. All signage shall conform to the current edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices published by the United States Department of Transportation. Temporary signs may be installed and maintained in lieu of permanent signs until curbs are installed and backfilled. Such signs shall meet the same standards for height, size and legibility as permanent signs but may be mounted on temporary structures. The Director of Public Works shall verify the installation of temporary street name signs prior to issuance of any building permit. 
b.  Note to appear on plat. All subdivision plats which require street name signs shall have a note located thereon stating: "No building permit shall be issued for any lot until street name, regulatory and warning signs are installed and verified by the department of public works on all streets on which such lot depends for access." 
    4-103.3. Private streets. No property shall be subdivided which does not obtain access from a public way, street or road. Private streets are not allowed. 
    4-103.4. Requirements for dedications, reservations, or improvements. Where a proposed subdivision adjoins or encompasses either a substandard street, or a route depicted upon the major thoroughfare plan, that is to be opened, widened or realigned, the following shall apply: 
4-103.401. Undeveloped property. 
a.  Substandard streets. Substandard streets encompassed by or adjacent to the proposed subdivision shall be improved by the developer in accordance with the minimum standards set forth in subsection 4-104.4, tables 1 and 2, for the portion of such street that is located within the boundaries of the subdivision or the abutting street half. 
b.  Planned routing. When applicable, the layout of a street(s) within a subdivision shall conform to the routing depicted upon the major thoroughfare plan. The amount of right-of-way for the type of street required shall be dedicated up to a maximum of that required for construction of "community collector" routes. Where any street so depicted requires a right-of-way greater than that required for construction of a community collector, the developer shall show on the face of the plat an additional area "reserved for future right-of-way" and any required yard area shall be measured from such reservation line. 
Regardless of the proposed width or functional character of the planned street adjacent to or encompassed by a proposed subdivision, the developer will not be required, (except as may be necessitated as a result of an approved traffic impact study), to improve or construct any street greater than that of a "community collector street" as [that term is] defined and depicted in these regulations. 
4-103.402. Developed property. When property containing existing structures is being divided simply to place each structure on a separate lot and the future right-of-way will fall within the footprint of an existing structure, then the subdivider shall be required to note on the face of the plat as, "reserved for future right-of-way" any additional area necessary for compliance with the major thoroughfare plan. The plat shall also contain a note stating, when any existing structure is demolished, the setback requirements for any new structure shall be measured from the reservation line. 
4-103.403. Required improvements or dedications. All on-site traffic improvements identified as being required in a traffic study prepared in accordance with the requirements of subsection 4-103.206, shall be made by the developer upon land which the developer controls. Any off-site improvements identified in such study shall be made on a pro rata basis to the extent the subdivision contributes to the requirement for such improvement(s). The Director of Public Works shall be responsible for calculating the extent of participation required in off-site improvements. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-103) 
Sec. 4-104. - Functional design criteria. 
    4-104.1. Purpose. The public way design standards set forth in this section are hereby required in order to provide public ways of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, sanitation, and road-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate public ways so as to compose a convenient and safe system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties. These provisions are intended to establish appropriate standards for the design of streets in residential subdivisions that will: 
1.  Promote the safety and convenience of vehicular traffic, 
2.  Protect the safety of neighborhood residents, 
3.  Minimize crime in residential areas, 
4.  Protect the residential qualities of neighborhoods by limiting traffic volume, traffic speed, noise and fumes, 
5.  Encourage the efficient use of land, 
6.  Minimize the cost of street construction and thereby restrain the rising cost of housing, and 
7.  Minimize the construction of impervious surface thereby protecting the quantity and quality of the community's water resources. 
    4-104.2. Design hierarchy. There is, hereby, established a design hierarchy according to street function. The purpose of the hierarchy is to establish clear functional guidelines and limitations to be utilized in the design of streets. 
4-104.201. New streets. Each proposed street shall be classified and designed for its entire length to meet or exceed the minimum standards for one of the following street types: 
a.  Residential access lane. 
b.  Residential access street. 
(1)  Rural residential access street. 
(2)  Urban residential access street. 
c.  Residential collector street. 
(1)  Rural residential collector street. 
(2)  Urban residential collector street. 
d.  Community collector street. 
e.  Arterial street. 
4-104.202. Existing streets. During the plan review process each street abutting or affecting the design of a subdivision or land development that is not already classified on the major thoroughfare plan shall be classified according to its function, design and use by the Planning Commission at the request of the applicant. The classification of existing streets shall include the hierarchy of subsection 4-104.201, above, and may also include classifications of higher order as determined by the adopted major thoroughfare plan. 
4-104.203. Traffic volume calculations. 
a.  Trip generation rates. The following chart shall be used to determine the anticipated average daily traffic level of proposed residential development: 
Average Weekday Trip Generation 
Rates Housing Type ADT Per Dwelling Unit Single-family detached dwellings 8 trips Cluster or townhouses 7 trips Garden apartments (1-4 stories) 6 trips Retirement complex 3.5 trips  
b.  Volume calculations. Calculation of traffic volumes shall be accomplished by using the following formula: 
(Factor for dwelling type) x (Number of units receiving access from street) = Design ADT 
    4-104.3. Residential street design criteria and service restrictions. The material contained within this segment is intended to provide information as to the intended function, design capacity and service limitations of the various street types presented in subsection 4-104.2, above. The order of presentation proceeds from smallest capacity street to the greatest. For each street identified within the hierarchy, the following design elements are presented: 
(1)  Street function. 
(2)  Design capacity and service restrictions. 
(3)  Street access criteria. 
4-104.301. Residential access lane. 
a.  Street function. A residential access lane is a frontage street that provides access to abutting properties; it shall be designed to carry no more traffic than that generated by those properties that gain direct access from the street. 
b.  Design capacity and service restriction. Each residential access lane shall be designed so that no section of the street conveys an average daily traffic (ADT) volume greater than 200 or serves more than 25 single-family dwellings. Each half [of] a loop street may be regarded as a single local access street and the total traffic volume generated on a loop street shall not exceed 400 ADT. 
c.  Street access. Residential access lanes may intersect or take access from any street type. Both ends of a loop street, however, must intersect the same collecting street and be laid out to discourage through traffic. 
4-104.302. Residential access street. 
a.  Street function. Residential access streets are designed to provide access to individual properties as well as access to the higher classification street network. The residential access street provides for neighborhood circulation and may carry neighborhood traffic and through movements. Residential access streets differ in design depending upon the location of such streets. The rural residential street is intended to maintain the rural character of the area or neighborhood. It is designed as a curbless paved street section, with gravel shoulders for emergency parking and open roadside ditches for drainage. The urban residential street performs the same function as the rural residential street except within an urban environment. The urban residential street is designed as a curb street. 
b.  Design capacity and service restriction. The residential access street is designed to convey an average daily traffic (ADT) volume in the range of 500 to 1,000. 
c.  Street access. If the total design traffic exceeds 500 ADT, a residential access street shall be provided with no fewer than two access intersections to streets of higher classification in the street hierarchy. For residential access streets with less than 500 ADT, one access intersection to a street of higher order is allowed. 
4-104.303. Residential collector street. 
a.  Street function. The residential collector street provides access to individual properties and collects and distributes neighborhood traffic from residential streets to community collector and arterial streets. 
b.  Design capacity and service restriction. The residential collector street is intended to serve anticipated traffic volumes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 trips per day. Whenever possible, residential collector streets shall be designed to have no residential lots fronting directly on them. When this is not possible, the amount of residential frontage shall not exceed the limits set forth in the accompanying chart. In addition, only lots having frontages of 100 feet or more may front on collector streets and space shall be provided on these lots for turnaround so that vehicles will not have to back onto collector streets. 
Percent of the Total Length of Residential Collector Streets, Which May Have Residential Lots Fronting on and Taking Access from the Collector Street ADT Level 1,000-1,999 1,200-1,599 1,600-1,999 2,000+ Percent of 
allowable access frontage 20% 10% 5% 0%  
4-104.304. Community collector street. 
a.  Street function. Community collector streets collect and distribute traffic from residential collector and other residential streets to the arterial transportation systems. 
b.  Design capacity and service restriction. The community collector street is designed for anticipated traffic volumes ranging from 2,500 to 6,000 trips per day. Community collector streets shall be designed to have no residential lots fronting directly on them. 
    4-104.4. General design. The general design of all public ways shall conform to the standards in tables 1 and 2, that follow, hereafter. 
4-104.401. Rights-of-way and pavement width. Minimum rights-of-way and pavement width shall be provided as required to meet the design standards for the various classifications of streets set out in tables 1 and 2. 
a.  Reduction in right-of-way width. The City may reduce the required right-of-way width for residential streets under the following conditions: 
(i)  The site is located within a planned unit development or a variable lot size residential development under applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
(ii)  The potential for future development will alter neither the street classification nor the design standards proposed. As a condition for varying the right-of-way requirements, the City may require binding agreements to insure no additional access to or use of the street. 
(iii)  In no instance shall a right-of-way be less than 30 feet. In granting the reduced right-of-way width, it shall be determined that sufficient width will be available to provide for all the following (unless separate right-of-way for them is being provided elsewhere to the satisfaction of the City, or they are clearly not required by the proposed development): 
Pavement. 
Curbs. 
Shoulders. 
Utility easements. 
Drainage swales. 
Pedestrian and/or bicycle paths. 
Street trees or other planting strips. 
Turning lanes.

Turnaround standard (no outlet streets) A 40-foot pavement radius for a cul-de-sac or a "Y" or "T" turnaround with 60-foot length, 20-foot width shall be provided at the terminus of all permanent dead end access streets serving residential property. The turnaround, including sidewalk where required, shall be within the right-of-way. The maximum length of permanent cul-de-sac streets shall be 700 feet and shall serve no more than 14 dwelling units. Temporary cul-de-sac streets may be a maximum of 1,000 feet in length.  
Increase in right-of-way width. The City may increase the required right-of-way width for residential streets under the following conditions: 
(i)  If proposed lots are large enough for further subdivision that may change the street classification in the future to a higher order street, the City may require that the right-of-way width for the higher order street be provided. 
(ii)  In unusual circumstances, the provision of the elements listed in subpart [subsection] a(iii) of this section may require right-of-way width in excess of that established in table 1 (above). 
4-104.402. Intersections. 
a.  Pavement shall intersect as nearly as possible to a 90-degree angle for a minimum of 50 feet from the intersection. A proposed intersection of two new public ways at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be permitted. Not more than two public ways shall intersect at any one point, unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission. 
b.  Centerline off-sets of less than 150 feet between T-type intersections within public ways shall not be permitted, except where the intersected public ways have separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where public ways intersect arterial or collector routes, the alignment of such streets shall be continuous. Intersections of arterial or community collector streets shall be at least 800 feet apart. 
c.  Minimum curb or edge of pavement radius shall be determined according to the specifications for the street of higher classification in the street system hierarchy, as specified below: This minimum should not be confused as the right-of-way return radius but is the curb edge of pavement. 
Minimum Radius of Returns At Street Intersections Street Classification Minimum Return Radius* Residential access lane 10 feet Residential access street 10 feet Residential collector 15 feet Community collector 30 feet Higher order street As determined by the City Engineer *This is the minimum.

d.  Whenever a proposed street intersects an existing or proposed street of higher order in the street hierarchy, the street of lower order shall be made a stop street. The street of lower order shall also be designed to provide a minimum corner sight distance as specified in table 1. 
e.  Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two-percent grade for a distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting public way. 
f.  The cross-slope on all public ways, including intersections, shall be three percent or less. 
4-104.403. Acceleration and deceleration lanes. 
a.  Deceleration or turning lanes may be required by the City along existing and proposed streets as determined by a traffic impact study required by subsection 4-103.206, or where the City can justify the need. 
b.  Deceleration lanes shall be designed to the following standards: 
(i)  The lane width shall be the same as the required width of the roadway moving lanes. 
(ii)  The lane shall provide the full required lane width for its full length. It shall not be tapered. 
(iii)  The minimum lane length shall be as follows: 
Design Speed of Road Minimum Deceleration Lane Length 30 mph 165 feet 40 mph 230 feet 50 mph 310 feet  
c.  Acceleration lanes are only required when indicated as needed by a traffic impact study. The design shall be as per the recommendation of the Director of Public Works. As necessary, a paved taper shall be provided for right turns. 
4-104.404. Marginal access and one-way streets. 
a.  Classification and design of marginal access streets. Marginal access streets may be utilized as an alternative to stripping off lots along existing or proposed collector or higher order streets. Marginal access streets shall be classified and designed to conform to the design standards and service restrictions of either residential access lanes or residential access streets as anticipated daily traffic may dictate. 
(i)  Intersection spacing. The minimum distance between intersections of the marginal access street with residential collectors shall be 300 feet. Minimum distances with higher order streets shall be determined by the Director of Public Works based upon the traffic characteristics of the higher order street. 
(ii)  Distance between travelways. A minimum distance of 30 feet shall be provided between the paved portion of the marginal access street and the paved portion of the higher order street. This area shall be used to provide a visual screen between the roadways by landscaping and/or use of a berm. 
b.  Utilization and design of one-way streets. One-way streets may be permitted as loop streets or marginal access streets where there is need to separate the directional lanes to preserve natural features to avoid excessive grading for street construction on steep slopes. Pavement and curb transitions shall be designed and constructed in accordance with standards provided by the Director of Public Works. 
4-104.405. Arrangement of dead-end streets. 
a.  Temporary stub streets. 
(i)  Residential access lane and residential access street stub streets. Residential access lanes and access street stub streets may be permitted only within subsections of phased development for which the proposed street extension in its entirety has been approved as part of a preliminary plat. 
(ii)  Collector stub streets. Stub streets may be permitted or required by the City on collector streets provided that the future extension of the street is deemed desirable by the City and conforms to the adopted major thoroughfare plan. 
(iii)  Temporary turnarounds. All stub streets shall be provided with a turnaround paved to an outside radius of 35 feet. No turnaround is required if the stub street provides access to four or less lots or housing units. In the later case, a sign indicating a dead-end street shall be posted. 
b.  Permanent dead-end public ways. 
(i)  General design standards. Where a public way does not extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Planning Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 150 feet. However, the Planning Commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnabout shall be provided at the end of a dead-end public way in accordance with the design standards of these regulations. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end public ways shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations. 
(ii)  Design of turnarounds. The type of turnaround required shall be determined by the Planning Commission based upon recommendation of the Director of Public Works. In general the design standards presented in table 2 [in subsection 4-104.4], shall apply. The Planning Commission will consider alternative terminations when the street is located upon steep slopes and excessive cut or fill will be required to meet the design standards of the typical sections. 
4-104.406. Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad right-of-way and limited access highways, where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows: 
a.  In residential areas, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normally required depth of the lot may be required adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for screening; the placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
b.  In commercial or industrial areas, the nearest public way extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial usage. 
c.  Public ways parallel to a railroad, when intersecting a public way which crosses the railroad at grade, shall to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
4-104.407. Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the Planning Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the subdivider without reimbursement from the governing body. The sharing of expenses for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the Planning Commission, shall be fixed by special agreement between the governing body and the subdivider. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-104) 
Sec. 4-105. - Road construction specifications. 
    The road construction specifications are included in these regulations as appendix B, and are adopted as a part hereof. These specifications shall be the minimum standards for any subdivision within the jurisdictional area. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-105) 
Sec. 4-106. - Drainage and storm sewers. 
    4-106.1. General requirements. All plats shall make adequate provisions for stormwater or floodwater run-off channels or basins. The stormwater drainage system shall be separate and independent from any sanitary sewer system. Each lot shall have a five-foot dedicated drainage easement on each lot line. The following notation regarding the use of these easements shall be made upon all plats: 
    "Public utility and drainage easements where shown hereon are intended to indicate an easement for construction operation and maintenance of public utilities and drainage structures; including but not limited to sanitary sewers, water lines, telephone signal conduits, electric conductors, drainage pipes and natural gas lines." 
    4-106.2. Nature of stormwater facilities. 
4-106.201. Stormwater design and construction specifications. The stormwater design and construction specifications included in these regulations as appendix C, and are adopted as a part thereof. These specifications shall be the minimum standards for any subdivision within the jurisdictional area. 
4-106.202. Location. The subdivider may be required to transport by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist prior to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the public right-of-way, wherever feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width. These facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the construction specifications contained in these regulations. 
4-106.203. Accessibility to public storm sewers. Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the developer shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of stormwater, subject to the specifications contained herein. 
4-106.204. Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. Necessary facilities shall be sized based on the construction specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential development within the watershed. 
4-106.205. Effect on downstream drainage areas. The subdivider shall prepare and submit to the Director of Public Works a study of the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream properties and drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Pre-development and post-development runoff rates, volumes and velocities along with associated calculations and maps shall be submitted with a stormwater drainage report prepared by a Tennessee registered engineer. If increased runoff rate or total volume impacts downstream drainage structures, then these structures shall be improved. Where it is anticipated that drainage and/or runoff from a development will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the Planning Commission shall withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for adequate improvement of such drainage facilities. The subdivider shall be required to construct adequate downstream facilities or contribute his pro rata share toward the construction of adequate downstream facilities, and install on-site stormwater detention to mitigate the downstream impacts. On-site stormwater detention proposed to reduce the peak rate of discharge to off-site drainage systems downstream shall not cause increased peak flows or velocities detrimental to downstream properties or facilities. When detention facilities are utilized, the peak rate of discharge after development shall not exceed the predevelopment peak rate. Controlled releases of discharge from a detention basin shall include V-notch, rectangular or other weir configurations which prevent increased discharge (above pre-development conditions) for storm events of five-, ten- and 25-year occurrences. Detention facilities shall be platted as perpetual drainage easements and shall be maintained by the property owner or the owners' association, as applicable. The City will in no way be responsible for maintenance of drainage facilities on private property. Estimated increases in discharge velocity shall be mitigated by energy dissipation devices where required to prevent erosion. The drainage system shall be designed to honor natural drainage divides, where practical. Surface waters shall not be concentrated and discharged onto adjoining property at rates and/or velocities exceeding predevelopment conditions, unless an easement expressly authorizing such discharge has been granted by the owner of the affected land or unless the discharge is into an adequate natural watercourse or drainage system. 
4-106.206. Areas of poor drainage. In general, areas of poor drainage shall be classified as land unsuitable for development (see subsection 4-101.401) and shall not be included in streets and lots. In any instance where it may be necessary to locate a roadway in an area subject to flooding that is not located within the 100-year regulatory flood boundary, the Planning Commission may approve such subdivision; provided, the applicant fills the affected flood area of said subdivision to place public way elevations no lower than two feet above the known flood elevation. The plat of such subdivision shall provide for a floodway along the bank of any stream or watercourse of width sufficient to contain or move the water of the 100-year regulatory flood, and no fill shall be placed in the floodplain; neither shall any building nor flood-restrictive structure be erected or placed therein. The boundaries of the flood area and floodplain, and the 100-year regulatory flood elevation, shall be determined by the Planning Commission based upon the review specified in subsection 2-103.2 of these regulations, and the submission of flood data in construction plans as specified in section 5-103 of these regulations. As general policy sinkholes shall be classified as land unsuitable for development (see subsection 4-101.401) and shall not be included in streets and lots. In any instance where it is unavoidable, the Director of Public Works and Planning Commission shall approve any alteration of a sinkhole or the drainage pattern. (See subsection 4-102.602, Lot drainage.) 
4-106.207. Floodplain areas. The Planning Commission shall prohibit the inclusion of any portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course within the "building site" (see definition) of any residential lot. In all instances the regulatory floodway shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste material, or stumps. Any subdivision that contains floodprone land shall be subject to the special provisions set forth in subsections 2-101.4 and 4-101.4; section 4-104; and subsection 4-102.602 (Lot drainage) of these regulations. 
4-106.208. Stormwater detention and discharge control. The general policy of the City is to provide detention for the increased volume of water generated by a development. The major factors in evaluating drainage designs will be the effect of increased runoff rates on downstream water levels and the proximity of any structures. Any drainage system that discharges without some form of detention shall route its water along a designated public drainage easement. A drainage system can be allowed to discharge along an existing but nonrecorded (prescriptive) easement if the following are true: 
a.  Post-development flow is less than or equal to the pre-development flow at the same location. (See subsection 4-106.205, Effect on downstream drainage areas.) 
b.  In order to prevent erosion at all outlet points, the subdivider's engineer will be required to design and submit for approval an outlet system that approximates the width and velocity of the flow that existed prior to development. 
    4-106.3. Dedication of drainage easements. 
4-106.301. General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of the 100-year flood elevation of such watercourse and of such width and construction as will be adequate. Where new open drainageways are utilized they shall be designed for the 25-year frequency flood. 
4-106.302. Drainage easements. 
a.  Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impracticable inclusion of drainage facilities within a public way right-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width for such facilities shall be provided across property outside the public way lines and with satisfactory access to public ways. Easements shall be indicated on the preliminary and final plats. Drainage easements shall be carried from the public way to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. 
b.  When downstream drainage improvements are proposed that will require additional easements across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage easements must be secured by the developer and indicated on a plat amendment for that property. 
c.  The applicant shall dedicate, when required by the Planning Commission, either in fee, or by drainage or conservation easement, the land on both sides of an existing watercourse for a distance to be determined by the Director of Public Works. 
4-106.303. Ditching, concrete ditch paving, and culverts and storm drains. The design and construction details of drainage facilities shall be in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. The Director of Public Works shall approve the design and construction details of all such facilities. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-106) 
Sec. 4-107. - Water facilities. 
    4.107.1. General requirements. 
1.  Necessary action shall be taken by the developer to extend a water supply system capable of providing domestic water use and fire protection. 
2.  Where required for fire protection, water mains shall be the greater of six inches in diameter or as required to provide required fire flow. The minimum size of any proposed water line shall be six inches in diameter. 
3.  All water systems, whether public or private, located in a floodprone area shall be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation. All water supply facilities located below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be designed to prevent the infiltration of floodwaters into the water supply system and discharges from the system into floodwaters. 
4.  All water systems, whether public or private, shall be constructed utilizing materials that comply with all state and local materials specifications. 
    4-107.2. Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required in all subdivisions; they shall be located no more than 700 feet apart and be within 400 feet of any residential, commercial, or industrial lot. The Planning Commission may require closer spacing where physical conditions or types of structures so warrant. To eliminate future public way cuttings or openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other water supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a public way shown on the subdivision plat. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-107) 
Sec. 4-108. - Sewage facilities. 
    4-108.1. General requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer facilities in a manner prescribed by the regulations of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and by any other applicable standards and specifications. All plans shall be designed and approved in accordance with the rules, regulations, specifications, and standards, of any applicable governmental agency or appropriate unit thereof. 
    4-108.2. Mandatory connection to public sewer system. 
1.  When public sanitary sewers are accessible to the subdivision, as determined by the Planning Commission, the subdivider shall provide such facilities to each lot therein and shall connect the facilities to the public system. The subdivider shall provide sewers that meet standards set forth in the regulations of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. 
2.  All sanitary sewer facilities located in a flood hazard area shall be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation. All sewer facilities located below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be designed to prevent infiltration of floodwaters into the sewer system and discharges from the system into floodwaters. 
3.  All public sanitary sewer systems shall be constructed utilizing materials that are ASTM and/or AWWA approved. 
    4-108.3. Individual disposal system requirements. If public sewer facilities are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, the individual disposal system, including the size of the septic tank and size of the tile fields or other secondary treatment device shall be approved by the county health department. The entire individual disposal system, including all drainage fields associated therewith, shall be located on the lot with the principal structure such system is to serve. The Planning Commission may prohibit installation of sewage disposal facilities requiring soil absorption systems where such systems will not function due to high groundwater, flooding, or unsuitable soil characteristics. The Planning Commission may require that the subdivider note on the face of the plat and any deed of conveyance that soil absorption fields are prohibited in designated areas. 
    4-108.4. Design criteria for sanitary sewers. Sanitary sewer systems shall be designed for the ultimate tributary population and shall be gravity flow systems where possible. Due consideration shall be given to any current zoning regulations and approved planning reports, where applicable. Sewer capacities shall be adequate to accommodate the anticipated maximum hourly quantity of sewage and industrial wastes, together with an adequate allowance for infiltration and other extraneous flow. Sewer connections to dwellings shall not be less than six inches in diameter, short laterals and all other lines shall be eight inches or larger in diameter, depending on anticipated flow. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-108; Ord. No. 2009-42, § 1, 7-27-2009) 
Sec. 4-109. - Utility easements. 
    4-109.1. Permanent easements. Perpetual unobstructed easements down all lot lines or additionally across lots, if deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, shall be provided for utilities (private or public). Such easements shall be at least ten feet wide, except for across-lot easements that shall be at least 20 feet wide. The subdivider shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure the coordination and continuation of utility easements established on adjacent properties with those proposed within his development. All easements shall be indicated on the plat. 
    4-109.2. Temporary construction easements. Temporary construction easements exceeding the width of permanent easements may be required as necessary until completion of any one project. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-109) 
Sec. 4-110. - Public uses. 
    4-110.1. Plat to provide for public uses. Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes a school, recreation use, a portion of a major public way, or other public use, as indicated on the land development plan and/or major street or road plan, or any portion thereof, such tract shall be suitably incorporated by the developer into his plat when first presented for review by the Planning Commission. After proper determination of its necessity by the Planning Commission and the appropriate governmental representative(s) involved in the acquisition and use of such site, and after a determination has been made to acquire the site by the public agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated by the developer into the plat prior to final approval by the Planning Commission and recording of the plat. 
    4-110.2. Referral to the governmental agency concerned. The Planning Commission shall refer any plat presented in accordance with subsection 4-110.1, to the governmental agency concerned with acquisition of the land. The Planning Commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the appropriate governmental agency 30 days for reply. Among the areas which the Planning Commission may propose for public acquisition, when the commission deems it appropriate and consistent with the policies and purposes set forth in these regulations, is any land within a floodway or floodway fringe determined according to the procedure outlined herein. The acquiring agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time required to complete the acquisition. 
    4-110.3. Notice to property owner. Upon receipt of an affirmative report, the Planning Commission shall notify the property owner and shall designate on all plats any areas proposed to be acquired by any governmental agency. 
    4-110.4. Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by a governmental agency on the final plat shall be initiated within 24 months of notification, in writing, from the owner that he intends to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a plat of a proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of the governmental agency to initiate acquisition of the property within the prescribed 24 months shall result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the property involved and freeing of the property for development in accordance with these regulations. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-110) 
Sec. 4-111. - Preservation of natural features and amenities. 
    Existing features that would add value to residential development or to the area as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision, as required by the Planning Commission. No change of grade of the land shall be undertaken nor shall any natural features (including trees) be removed or relocated until the Planning Commission has approved a preliminary subdivision plat. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-111) 
Sec. 4-112. - Nonresidential subdivisions. 
    4-112.1. General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for a commercial or industrial purpose, the layout of the subdivision with respect to such land shall make such provisions as the Planning Commission may require. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these regulations; as well as such additional standards as set forth by the Planning Commission. 
    4-112.2. Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these regulations which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the subdivider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that the public way, parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed: 
1.  Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the types of nonresidential development anticipated; 
2.  Special requirements may be imposed by the governing body with respect to any public way, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction specifications; 
3.  Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from potential nuisances from the proposed nonresidential subdivision, including provision of extra depth in parcels backing on existing or potential residential development and provisions for permanently landscaped buffer strips, when necessary; and 
4.  Public ways carrying nonresidential traffic, especially trucks, normally shall not be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or potential residential areas. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1997, § 4-112) 
Sec. 4-113. - Handicap accessible design for streets, roads and sidewalks. 
    The construction and maintenance of all required streets, roads and sidewalks shall be in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Justice Department's Standards on Accessible Design (JDSAD), originally codified at 28 CFR, part 36, app. A.

ARTICLE V. - SPECIFICATIONS FOR DOCUMENTS TO BE SUBMITTED 

Sec. 5-101. - Conceptual plan. 
    5-101.1. Site analysis. Conceptual plans submitted to the Planning Commission are intended to provide an analysis of each site's special features and the designers response to those features. Such plans are required for all major subdivisions, as these plans form the basis of the design process for greenway lands, house locations, street alignments, and lots lines. A site analysis shall accompany each conceptual plan. As a minimum, the site analysis must include: 
1.  A contour base map at least upon topographical maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey; 
2.  The location of severely constraining elements such as steep slopes (over 20 percent, wetlands, karst features, watercourses, intermittent streams and 100-year floodplains, and all existing rights-of-way and easements; 
3.  Soil boundaries as shown on USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service medium-intensity maps; and 
4.  The location of significant features such as woodlands, tree lines, open fields or meadows, scenic views into or out from the property, watershed divides and drainageways, fences or stone walls, rock outcrops, and existing structures, roads, tracks and trails. 
    5-101.2. Features of conceptual plans. The site analysis shall form the basis for the conceptual plan, which shall show the tentative location of houses, streets, lot lines, and greenway lands in new residential subdivisions. The conceptual plan shall, as a minimum show: 
1.  A scale drawing of the property indicating the size of the original tract(s) being subdivided and the names of the owners of adjoining property; 
2.  Notation of any existing legal rights-of-way, easements, or other encumbrances affecting the property; 
3.  A contour base map at least on topographical maps published by the USGS, with contours shown at intervals no greater than five feet, extended into adjacent properties; 
4.  The location of all "Land unsuitable for development" as specified in subsection 4-101.401 of these regulations; 
5.  The location of (and proposed protective measures for) all watercourses and intermittent streams; 
6.  The general location of proposed streets to include proposed classification of each street and designation of construction routes as required by section 4-103.209 (Designation of construction routes); 
7.  The approximate size and general location of proposed building lots; 
8  In any instance where septic sewage disposal is anticipated, soil boundaries as shown on USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service medium-intensity maps; 
9.  The location of significant features such as woodlands, tree lines, open fields or meadows and scenic views; 
10.  Name of owner; name of plat designer; and zoning classification; 
11.  Vicinity map of property, date and approximate north point; 
12.  Proposed extension(s) of water and/or sanitary sewer service to the property along with the proposed routing of such within the subdivision; and 
13.  Preliminary storm drainage design noting approximate volumes, direction of flows and location of proposed detention or retention areas. 
    5-101.3.\ The four-step design process. Each conceptual plat shall follow a four-step design process, as described below. When the conceptual plat is submitted, applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the Planning Commission that these four design steps were followed by their site designers in determining the layout of their proposed streets, house lots, and greenway lands. 
1.  Designating conservation lands. During the first step, all conservation lands shall be identified, using the site analysis. Conservation areas consist of wetlands, floodplains, slopes over 20 percent, and all other portions of the site defined as "unsuitable for development" in subsection 4-101.401 (Land unsuitable for development). 
2.  Location of house sites. During the second step, potential house sites are tentatively located. Because the proposed location of houses within each lot represents a significant decision with potential impacts on the ability of the development to meet the evaluation criteria contained in subsection 4-102.102 (Evaluation criteria), subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the conceptual plan. House sites should generally be located no closer than 100 feet from conservation areas. 
3.  Street and lot layout. The third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and economic way. When lots and access streets are laid out, they shall be located in such a way as to avoid or at least minimize adverse impacts on conservation areas. To the greatest extent practicable, wetland crossings and streets traversing existing slopes over 15 percent shall be strongly discouraged. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the City and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of the property (or on adjoining parcels). Where cul-de-sacs are necessary, those serving six or fewer homes may be designed with hammer-heads facilitating three-point turns. Cul-de-sacs serving more than six homes shall generally be designed with a central island containing indigenous trees and shrubs (either conserved or planted). The City generally encourages the creation of single-loaded residential access streets, in order that the maximum number of homes in new developments may enjoy views of open space. Note that in situations where more formal neo-traditional or village-type layouts are proposed, Steps Two and Three may be reversed, so that the location of house sites follows the location of streets and squares. 
4.  Lot lines. The fourth step is simply to draw in the lot lines (where applicable). These are generally drawn midway between the house locations.

Sec. 3-104. - Supplementary use regulations. 
    3-104.1 General[ly]. In addition to the bulk, parking, landscaping and other regulatory provisions of this ordinance, supplemental development standards are required for specific land uses when located in certain zone districts. These development standards are necessary because certain uses may tend to dominate or adversely affect the area more than other uses permitted within the same zone district due to large land area, unique operating, traffic generating or other characteristics. The land use tables for the zoning districts reference those uses and activities which must comply with supplemental development standards as: 
SUP: Principal use permitted with supplemental provisions 
C: Conditional use (subject to approval by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals) 
ASP: Accessory use permitted with supplemental provisions 
The community service or institutional nature of these activities makes it necessary that they be located within areas where the potential exists for the use to be incompatible. A distinction is made between those uses and activities which involve relatively minor and predictable impacts and those uses which have impacts that cannot be satisfactorily predetermined for every possible location within a zone district. Uses with relatively minor, predictable impacts are indicated with the designation (SUP). These uses may be approved by the Zoning Administrator upon a demonstration that the established conditions can be met. The second category involve "Conditional uses" (C) which are permitted only upon approval by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals. The last category involves certain uses which are incidental to the operation and enjoyment of other principal land uses but remain appropriate only when certain standards are applied to limit their scope. These are designated as "Accessory uses permitted with supplemental provisions (ASP)." 
The supplementary use regulations appearing within this section shall apply to new uses and to existing uses as set out in subsections 3-104.2 and 3-104.3. 
    3-104.2 Application to new uses. No zoning permit shall be issued for the use of any building or land, where such use was not established prior to adoption of this ordinance, unless the activity is in compliance with all supplementary use regulations specified for such activity within this article. 
    3-104.3 Application to existing uses. Where any use of a building or land was established prior to adoption of this ordinance, such activity may be continued or expanded according to the provisions of article XIII of this ordinance; provided, however, that any expansion of such activity shall comply as fully as possible with the supplementary use regulations specified for such activity within this section. 
    3-104.4 Plans required. 
1.  Principal uses permitted with supplemental provisions. Prior to establishing or expanding any use or activity classified as a principal use permitted with supplemental provisions (SUP) the Zoning Administrator shall have determined that such use complies with all applicable standards established for such use in this ordinance and, in any instance where either new construction or exterior modifications to an existing structure is to be undertaken in conjunction with the establishment of such use or activity, a site plan meeting the specifications of article XIV, subsection 14-103.2, is approved. 
2.  Conditional uses. No zoning permit shall be issued for any use or activity classified as a conditional (C) use until such use is approved by the Zoning Board of [Zoning] Appeals and, in any instance where either new construction or exterior modifications to an existing structure is to be undertaken in conjunction with the establishment of such use or activity, a site plan meeting the specifications of article XIV, subsection 14-103.2, is approved. 
    3-104.5 Provisions applicable to residential activities. 
1.  Single-family and duplex dwellings. When a single-family or duplex dwelling is located within variable lot size residential development (VLRD) the supplemental development standards of article V, subsection 5-104.3, shall apply to such use. 
2.  Manufactured home dwelling. When a manufactured home is located within a Manufactured Home Park (MHP) District, the supplemental development standards of article V, subsection 5-104.2, shall apply to such use. 
3.  Multifamily dwelling. When a multifamily dwelling is located within a complex of two or more buildings on a zone lot or portion of a zone lot, the supplemental development standards of article V, subsection 5-104.1, shall apply to such use. 
4.  Attached dwellings. All attached dwellings shall comply with the supplemental development standards of article V, subsection 5-104.4 
    3-104.6 Provisions applicable to community facility activities. 
1.  Child care facilities. In all districts where authorized as either a use permitted with supplemental provisions (SUP) or a conditional (C) use, the following supplementary regulations shall apply to uses classified in the child care facilities activity type:

In any instance where the Zoning Administrator shall find that questions exist concerning compliance with any aspect or limitation of the permit, he shall refuse to renew the permit and immediately take all actions necessary to have the permit reviewed by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals.

ARTICLE V. - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 5-101. - Purposes of residential districts. 
    5-101.1 General purposes. The residential districts established in this ordinance are designed to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity and other aspects of the general welfare. These goals include, among others, the following: 
1.  To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for residential developments to adequately meet the housing needs of the present and expected future population of the urban area, with due allowance to the need for a variety of choices in site selection. 
2.  To permit improved movement on the public ways and to effectively utilize existing public ways, and, as far as possible, to mitigate the effects of heavy traffic and more particularly all through traffic, in residential areas. 
3.  To protect residential areas against flood, fire, explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation, and other dangers, and against offensive matter, heat, glare, humidity and other objectionable influences. 
4.  To protect residential areas against undue congestion, as far as possible, by regulating the density of population, the intensity of activity, and the bulk of buildings in relation to the surrounding land and to one another. 
5.  To require open space in residential areas whenever practicable in order to open up these areas to light and air, to provide open space for rest and recreation, and to break up the monotony of continuous building bulk and thereby to provide a more desirable living environment. 
6.  To provide for access of light and air to windows and for privacy, as far as possible, by controls over the height of buildings and structures. 
7.  To provide appropriate space for public and private educational, religious, recreational and similar facilities, and public utilities which serve the needs of nearby residents, which generally perform their own activities more effectively in a residential environment, and which do not create objectionable influences, and to coordinate the intensity of residential land use with appropriate community facilities. 
8.  To provide a zoning framework conducive to freedom of architectural design in order to encourage development of more attractive and economical building forms. 
9.  To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for agricultural activities. 
10.  To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development in accordance with a well considered general plan to promote stability of residential development, to protect the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of land and buildings and to protect the community's tax revenues. 
    5-101.2 District purposes. 
1.  AR-40, Agricultural/Residential Districts. These districts are designed to provide for low-density residential development in conjunction with suitable areas for the growing of crops, animal husbandry, dairying, forestry and other similar activities. The intensity of development is expected to range from that which characterizes rural environments to that seen in low-density suburban areas where public sanitary sewer service is least practical. In addition, these districts may include areas and lands not suited by reason of soil, geologic, topographic or other limitations for development. These districts also include community facilities, public utilities, and open uses which serve specifically the residents of these districts, or that are benefited by an open environment without creating objectionable or undesirable influences that are incompatible with a rural environment. It is the express purpose of this ordinance to exclude from these districts all buildings or other structures and uses having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit or otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations specifically provided by these regulations for these districts shall be considered as not having such characteristics if they, otherwise, conform to the provisions of this ordinance. 
2.  RS-40, Single-Family Residential Districts. These districts are designed to provide for low-density residential development in areas where public sanitary sewer service is least practical or where large lots and an open appearance is desired. In addition, these districts may include areas and lands not suited by reason of soil, geologic, topographic, or other limitations for development. These districts also include community facilities, public utilities, and open uses which serve specifically the residents of these districts, or that are benefited by an open environment without creating objectionable or undesirable influences that are incompatible with a suburban residential environment. It is the express purpose of this ordinance to exclude from these districts all buildings or other structures and uses having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit or otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations specifically provided by these regulations for these districts shall be considered as not having such characteristics if they, otherwise, conform to the provisions of this ordinance. 
3.  RS-30, RS-20 and RS-15, Single-Family Residential Districts. These districts are designed to provide suitable areas for single-family residential development at densities which typically characterize a suburban environment where appropriate urban services and facilities, specifically, including public sewer service, are provided at the time of development. Residential development will consist of single detached dwellings and such other structures as are accessory thereto. These districts also include community facilities, public utilities, and open uses which serve specifically the residents of these districts, or that are benefited by an open residential environment without creating objectionable or undesirable influences upon residential developments. Further, it is the intent of this ordinance that these districts be so located that the expansion of appropriate urban services can be physically and economically facilitated for the orderly expansion and maintenance of urban residential development throughout the planning jurisdiction. It is the express purpose of this ordinance to exclude from these districts all buildings or other structures and uses having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit or otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations specifically provided by these regulations for these districts shall be considered as not having such characteristics if they otherwise conform to the provisions of this ordinance. 
4.  RS-10 Single-Family Residential Districts and R-10 One-and Two-Family Residential Districts. These districts are designed to provide suitable areas for single-family and, in the case of the R-10 district, duplex residential development. Residential development will consist of single detached dwelling structures, duplexes and other structures accessory thereto. These districts also include community facilities, public utilities, and open uses which serve specifically the residents of these districts, or that are benefited by an open residential environment without creating objectionable or undesirable influences upon residential developments. Further, it is the intent of this ordinance that these districts be located where appropriate urban services and facilities, specifically, including public sewer service, are provided so that the expansion of appropriate urban services can be physically and economically facilitated throughout the planning jurisdiction. It is the express purpose of this ordinance to exclude from these districts all buildings or other structures and uses having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit, or otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations specifically provided by these regulations for these districts shall be considered as not having such characteristics if they otherwise conform to the provisions of this ordinance. 
5.  RM-8, Multifamily Residential Districts. The RM-8 districts are designed to provide suitable areas for multifamily dwellings at densities which are conducive to development of townhouse, and other forms of attached dwellings where sufficient urban facilities are available or where such facilities will be available prior to development. These districts may permit a variety of housing types and forms of property ownership within the same development. In order to permit maximum flexibility in the design solutions and ownership mechanisms available within these districts while maintaining necessary control over the development process, any RM-8 district created after adoption of this ordinance shall not be created as a freestanding district, but shall in all instances be overlain by a PUD, Planned Unit Development District. These districts also permit community facilities, public utilities, and open uses which serve specifically the residents of these districts, or that are benefited by an urban residential environment without creating objectionable or undesirable influences upon residential developments. Further, it is the intent of this ordinance that these districts be located where appropriate urban services and facilities, specifically, including public sewer service, are provided so that expansion of appropriate urban services can be physically and economically facilitated throughout the planning jurisdiction. It is the express purpose of this ordinance to exclude from these districts all buildings or other structures and uses having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit or otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations specifically provided by these regulations for these districts shall be considered as not having such characteristics if they otherwise conform to the provisions of this ordinance. 
6.  RM-16, Multifamily Residential Districts. The RM-16 districts are designed to provide suitable areas for multifamily dwellings at high densities where sufficient urban facilities, specifically, including public sewer service, are available or where such facilities will be available prior to or at the time development. These districts may permit a variety of housing types and forms of property ownership within the same development. In order to permit maximum flexibility in the design solutions and ownership mechanisms available within these districts while maintaining necessary control over the development process, any RM-16 district created after adoption of this ordinance shall not be created as a freestanding district, but shall in all instances be overlain by a PUD, Planned Unit Development District. These districts also permit community facilities, public utilities, and open uses which serve specifically the residents of these districts, or that are benefited by an urban residential environment without creating objectionable or undesirable influences upon residential developments. It is the express purpose of this ordinance to exclude from these districts all buildings or other structures and uses having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit or otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations specifically provided by these regulations for these districts shall be considered as not having such characteristics if they, otherwise, conform to the provisions of this ordinance. 
7.  R-MHP, Manufactured Home Park Residential Districts. These districts are designed to provide suitable areas for manufactured home parks where sufficient urban facilities, specifically, including public sewer service, are available prior to or at the time of development. Manufactured homes and buildings necessary to support the residential occupancy of these structures are permitted. In order to permit maximum flexibility in the design solutions and ownership mechanisms available within these districts while maintaining necessary control over the development process, any R-MHP district created after adoption of this ordinance shall not be created as a freestanding district, but shall in all instances be overlain by a PUD, Planned Unit Development District. These districts are intended also to permit community facilities and public utility installations which are necessary to service and do service specifically the residents of these districts, or which are benefited by and compatible with a residential environment. It is the express purpose of this ordinance to exclude from these districts all buildings or other structures and uses having commercial characteristics and not planned as an integral part of a total residential development, whether operated for profit or otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations specifically provided for in these regulations for these districts shall be considered as not having such characteristics if they otherwise conform to the provisions of this ordinance.

Key to interpreting use classifications. 
P = Use permitted by right within the district. 
SUP = Principal use permitted with supplemental provisions. 
C = Conditional use subject to approval by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals. 
ASP = Accessory use permitted with supplemental provisions. 
(1)  This district requires a mandatory PUD overlay. 
(2)  See subsection 5-104.1. 
(3)  See subsection 5-104.2. 
    5-102.3 Use permitted with supplemental provisions (SUP). A use permitted with supplemental provisions is an activity, use or structure which is permitted subject to a finding by the Zoning Administrator that the specific standards indicated for the use in question have been met. Only those uses and structures so indicated in table 5-102A, may be allowed within the districts indicated. 
    5-102.4 Conditional uses (C). A conditional use is an activity, use, or structure which may require large land area, have unique operating, traffic generating or other characteristics that may tend to dominate or adversely affect the area more than do other uses permitted within the same zone district. Because the impacts of these uses cannot be satisfactorily predetermined for every possible location within a zone district, these land uses are permitted only upon approval by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals. Only those uses and structures so indicated in table 5-102A, may be allowed within the districts indicated. 
    5-102.5 Accessory uses. In addition to the principal activities expressed above, each activity type shall be deemed to include activities customarily associated with and appropriate, incidental and subordinate to the principal activity when such accessory activity is located on the same zone lot as such principal activity and meets the further conditions set forth in article III, section 3-105. Accessory uses designated with the letter (P), in table 5-102A, are permitted as a matter of right and no permit is required to conduct the activity in question. Those accessory uses designated with the letters (ASP) require a permit obtained from the Office of the Zoning Administrator. Permits for accessory uses designated (ASP) shall be issued upon demonstration that the activity in question meets the requirements established for such activity article III, section 3-105. The third classification of accessory uses designated by the letter (C) require approval as a conditional use by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Upon issuance of any permit for a conditional accessory use such use or activity shall be continuously subject to compliance with any operational standard or criteria established by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals. 
    5-102.6 Temporary uses. The temporary uses and structures specified in article III, section 3-106, as permissible within residential districts, may be permitted for the limited time periods indicated for each such use or activity. 
    5-102.7 Uses not permitted. Any uses or structures not allowable as permitted uses, conditional uses, temporary uses or accessory uses are prohibited within the various residential districts. 
    5-102.8 Restriction of buildings permitted on residential zone lots. Only one principal building may be permitted on any zone lot, except as may otherwise be approved as follows: 
1.  As part of a complex of dwellings subject to the provisions of subsections 5-104.1 or 5-104.2. 
2.  As part of a PUD, Planned Unit Development District as provided in this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2001-34, 10-22-2001; Ord. No. 2004-34, 8-9-2004; Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 5-102) 
Sec. 5-103. - Bulk regulations. 
    5-103.1 General[ly]. The minimum lot dimensions, maximum lot coverage, maximum density, minimum front, rear, interior and street side yards, maximum building heights and minimum separation between buildings on the same zone lot within any base residential district shall be as indicated in table 5-103a, Bulk regulations for residential districts, and the additional bulk regulations specified in this section. For certain uses, alternative bulk regulations may be specified in this article or other articles of this ordinance. Bulk regulations for PUD, Planned Unit Development Overlay Districts shall be as specified in article VIII, section 8-207, Residential development standards. 
    5-103.2 Lot dimensions. No lot shall be created and no building permit or zoning approval shall be issued for any lot that does not meet the following minimum dimensional requirements, unless otherwise provided in the development plan of a planned unit development: 
1.  Lot area. 
a.  Minimum area. Within the various residential districts, the minimum horizontal area of a lot shall not be less than the greater of: that indicated in table 5-103a, Bulk regulations for residential districts, or that required to meet the provisions of article XIII, Environmental and performance standards. 
b.  Reduction in lot area prohibited. No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in area so that yards, lot area per dwelling unit, lot width, building area, or other requirements of the zoning ordinance are not maintained. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for a public purpose. 
2.  Lot width. The minimum lot width (measured at the building line) shall not be less than indicated in table 5-103a, or otherwise specified in this ordinance.

3.  Lot frontage. All lots shall have a minimum of 50 feet of frontage on a publicly dedicated and maintained street or a permanent access easement as defined and regulated by this ordinance, except that lots located along the terminus of a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum of 35 feet of frontage. 
4.  Maximum permitted lot coverage. Within the various residential districts, the maximum zone lot coverage by all buildings, principal and accessory, shall not, except as provided in subsection 5-104.3, exceed the percentage of the total area of the zone lot indicated in table 5-103a. 
    5-103.3 Density regulations. 
1.  Basic requirement. The residential density permitted upon any zone lot found within the residential districts is controlled by the greater of the minimum lot size specified or, in the instance of multiple dwelling units permitted on a single lot, the development area required for each dwelling or rooming unit permitted to locate thereon. This is determined by dividing the total area of the zone lot by the development area per dwelling or rooming unit which is presented in table 5-103a. 
2.  Adjustment for lot area remainder. In all districts where residential uses are permitted, if an amount of lot area not allocated to a dwelling unit is less than that required for one additional dwelling, the remaining lot area may be used to satisfy lot area requirements if it represents not less than three-fourths of the total required. 
    5-103.4 Height regulations. 
1.  Basic requirements. The maximum permitted height for buildings shall not, except as provided in subpart 2 of this section, exceed that set forth for the various residential districts in table 5-103a. 
2.  General exception to height regulations. The height limitation contained in the district regulations does not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, radio towers, water tanks, ventilators, chimneys or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the eave height of a building and not intended for human occupancy. 
3.  Buildings to be approved by fire department. Any building exceeding 35 feet in height shall be approved by the fire department prior to the issuance of any building permit. The fire department may stipulate special fire protection measures as a condition of approval of any such structure. In any such instance, the protection measures specified by the fire department shall become a supplemental design provision applicable to such use. 
    5-103.5 Yard regulations. 
1.  Application of the lot line equivalent to measurement of yards. The following provisions shall apply in the determination of a lot line equivalent: 
a.  A front lot line equivalent is a straight line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. In the case of rounded property corners at street intersections, the foremost point of a side lot line shall be assumed to be the point at which the side lot line and the front lot line would have met without such rounding. 
b.  A rear lot line equivalent is a straight line joining the rearmost points of the side lot lines. 
c.  A side lot line equivalent is a straight line joining the ends of the front yard line and the rear yard line on the same side of the zone lot. 
In all residential districts, the width or depth of a yard shall be measured perpendicular to lot line equivalents. 
2.  Yard diagrams. The yard diagrams as set forth in illustration 2-102.2A can be found on file in the Planning Department, shall be used in clarifying the meaning of the [terms] "line" and "yard" [in the] definitions in this section. 
3.  Permitted obstructions in required yards. In all residential districts, the following shall not be considered obstructions when located within a required yard, except that these items shall comply with subpart 4 of this section, Obstructions prohibited at street intersections: 
a.  In any yard. 
Air conditioning units, provided that no such unit shall extend more than one-half the required width of the yard. 
Arbors and trellises. 
Awnings or canopies projecting from a building wall over a required yard not more than six feet, and having no supports other than provided by the wall or its integral parts. 
Bay windows not projecting more than two feet into the required yard. In no case shall bay windows be located less than five feet from any lot line. 
Chimneys projecting not more than three feet into and not exceeding two percent of the area, of the required yard. 
Driveways subject to other specific provisions of this ordinance related directly thereto. 
Eaves, gutters, or down spouts, projecting into or over required yards not more than 24 inches or 20 percent of the width of such yard, whichever is the lesser distance. 
Fire escapes or staircases, the riser of which shall be at least 50 percent open, and whose vertical projection downward onto a required yard does not project more than three feet into, and not exceeding ten percent of the area of the required yard. 
Flagpoles having only one structural ground member. 
Fountains. 
Mailboxes. 
Open terraces, including natural plant landscaping. 
Sculpture or other similar objects of art. 
Street furniture such as, but not limited to, benches, drinking fountains, trash receptacles, ash trays, light standards, or directional signs. 
Vehicular parking areas, unless, otherwise, specifically prohibited by applicable sections of this ordinance. 
Vents necessary for use of fallout shelters constructed below grade of such yards, but excluding all other parts of such shelters. 
Walls, including retaining walls, or fences not exceeding six feet in height measured from finish grade level at any point along the length of, and on any side of, such walls, including retaining walls, or fences, and not roofed or structurally part of a building. 
b.  In any rear yard. 
1.  In any rear yard, clothes poles, clothes lines and recreational equipment shall be allowed. 
2.  In any rear yard, accessory buildings shall be allowed under the following conditions:

c.  In any front or side yard. In any front or side yard, accessory buildings shall only be allowed by conditional use granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon a finding that the following requirements have been met: 
1.  The building conforms to the principal building in architecture and external building materials; and 
2.  The building is not located within any required front or side yard setback; and 
3.  The building height shall be the lesser of 20 feet or the height of the principal building. 
4.  A plot plan is submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals that demonstrates compliance with all plot plan requirements for residential construction. 
5.  The property: 
(i)  Has direct frontage on Old Hickory Lake; or 
(ii)  Exceeds five acres, has topographic constraints or other unique physical irregularities that render the rear yard unusable for the location of an accessory building, and is zoned AR-40 or RS-40. 
4.  Obstructions prohibited at street intersections. On a corner lot, no fence, wall, hedge, or other planting or structure that will materially obstruct vision between a height of 21/2 feet and ten feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets shall be erected, placed, or maintained within the triangular area formed by the street lines at such corner lots and a straight line joining such street lines at points which are 35 feet distance from the intersection of the street lines and measured along said street lines. In case of rounded street lines at the intersecting streets, such measurement shall be made from the point of intersection of the tangents of the curve constituting the rounding. (See the [following] illustration 5-103.5A, Vision clearance area:) 
Y = Corner Sight Distance, measured from point "c" and "c" to "d." b = Eye level from a car stopped at the intersection on the minor road; for this regulation "b" is situated 3.75 feet above the higher order street. a and d = A point 4.5 feet above the centerline of the higher order street. c = Approximate center of intersection. The entire area of the clear sight triangle described by points "a," "b," "c," shall be designed to provide an unobstructed view across it from point "b" to all points 4.5 feet above the roadway along the centerline from point "a" to point "d."

5.  Basic requirements. In all residential districts, the minimum requirement for front, side and rear yards shall be as set forth in table 5-103a. 
6.  Special conditions affecting yards. 
a.  Front yards to be measured from future street lines. For the purpose of providing adequate space for future widening of streets, required front yards shall be determined by the right-of-way as shown on the latest official major thoroughfare plan. 
b.  Rear yard exception for through lots. In all residential districts, no rear yard regulations shall apply to any through lot which extends less than 250 feet in depth from street to street. The depth of such lot shall be considered to be the mean length of its side lot lines. In lieu thereof a front yard shall be required for each street frontage. 
c.  Yard requirements for zone lots of unusual shape. In all residential districts, wherever a zone lot is of such unusual shape that the yard provisions of these regulations cannot be specifically applied, the Zoning Administrator may substitute special yard requirements for such lot only to the extent that these regulations are inapplicable and not to exceed the average of the yard requirements on adjacent lots in the district. 
d.  Special yard requirements for agricultural activities. Within those residential districts where agricultural activities are permitted there shall be provided a minimum yard from all property lines of not less than 200 feet for all permitted barns and other structures, including feed lots and pens, where animals are maintained. 
e.  Special yard requirements for corner lots. The minimum required width of a side yard abutting a street shall be one-half the minimum required front yard depth for the district. Parking within this side yard is prohibited. 
f.  Minimum side yard for residential structure with facade parallel to a side lot line. For any residential structure constructed with a front and/or rear building facade parallel to a side lot line, the required side yard shall be not less than one-half the minimum required front yard depth for the district. 
g.  Special provisions for front yard setback. Any alteration, addition or construction of a building or structure on a zone lot shall extend no closer to the street which abuts the designated front yard than the average of the distances of the buildings located within 100 feet on each side of the lot whereon the alteration, addition or construction is to occur; provided that no building shall be required to provide a front yard of greater than twice the minimum front yard for the district. The average front yard requirement shall not prohibit alterations or additions to an existing structure which has irregular front walls provided said alteration or addition extends no closer to the street than the existing closest front wall to the street. The Board of [Zoning] Appeals shall have jurisdiction to vary from this strict application upon property where such provision would create an undue hardship. 
h.  Special yards and setbacks along district boundaries. Along such portion of the boundary of any Multifamily (R-M) or Manufactured Home [Park] (R-MHP) District, which coincides with a side or rear lot line of a zone lot in any other residential district, the following shall apply: 
i.  Residential buffer yards. An open area unobstructed from the ground to the sky shall be provided within the multifamily or R-MHP district, said area being at least 30 feet in width or depth. Such open area shall not be used for accessory off-street parking, or for accessory off-street loading, or for storage or processing of any kind. 
ii.  Special front setbacks.

All developments involving condominium or cooperative ownership shall be reviewed and approved under the provisions for planned unit developments (See article VIII). 
2.  Master site development plan required. It is the express purpose of these provisions to establish design criteria and to provide for implementation of these provisions by Planning Commission review of the master development plan required for all such development by article XIV, subsection 14-103.2. Provided, however, that in any instance where this use is located within a planned unit development this requirement may be fulfilled by submission of the plans required by that section. 
3.  Design criteria, general. It is the intent that multifamily dwellings where they are permitted: 
a.  May be appropriately intermingled with other types of housing; 
b.  Shall not contain more than 12 dwelling units per floor on a single unbroken frontage; and 
c.  Shall constitute groupings making efficient economical, comfortable and convenient use of land and open space. 
4.  Design criteria, detailed. 
a.  Each dwelling unit shall be provided with reasonable visual and acoustical privacy. A fence at least six feet in height shall enclose the boundary of each multifamily development site. A detail of the proposed fence is to be presented with the site development plan. The aesthetic and protective nature of the proposed fence shall be considered an integral element of the overall site design and shall be reviewed as part of the design review process. Where in the judgment of the Planning Commission alternative measures such as landscaping or placing of berms are found to provide equal or superior protection, these measures may be substituted for the fence. 
b.  Paved pedestrian walkways shall be provided for convenient and safe access to all living units and recreational facilities from the streets, driveways, parking courts or garages and for convenient circulation and access to all facilities. 
c.  The appearance and character of the site shall be preserved and enhanced by retaining and protecting existing trees and other site features to the maximum extent feasible. Prior to any site clearing or development activity the developer shall submit a landscape plan along with the site development plan. Where necessary to provide both internal and external privacy and to screen out objectionable features such as noise or automobile lights, additional new plant material shall be added. 
d.  Existing trees, shrubs, evergreens and ground cover shall be retained to the extent that they enhance the project, are effective as a screen planting or are useful in protecting slopes from erosion. 
e.  An adequate amenity package for occupants of the apartments shall be provided. The amenity package shall as a minimum include the following: 
i.  Exterior sitting areas with a total minimum area of 20 square feet per bedroom, easily accessible by paved walkways to the residents such facilities are designed to serve. Generally, such facility shall be located no more than 750 feet from any residential building it is to serve. All sitting areas shall be equipped, with benches, picnic tables and other passive recreational facilities. All such sites shall be suitably landscaped to enhance their intended function.

The density standards established for individual districts are to be maintained on an overall basis and thereby provide desirable and proper open air space, tree cover, recreation areas or scenic vistas; all with the intent of preserving the natural beauty and environmental integrity of the area, while at the same time maintaining the necessary maximum population density limitations of the base zoning districts. 
1.  General provisions. The provisions contained within this section are intended to provide a flexible procedure for locating dwellings upon sites. As such, the provisions do not constitute a use but an alternative procedure for the spacing of buildings and the use of open areas surrounding those buildings. It is necessary, however, that the purposes and intent of this ordinance be ensured and that proper light, air and privacy be made available for each dwelling unit. The master site development plan required in subpart 2 of this section, is intended to provide not only an accurate statement of the development scheme proposed for each such development but an enforceable legal instrument whereby the Planning Commission may be ensured that the general purposes, standards, etc., contained in this ordinance are being met. 
2.  Master site development plan required. 
a.  Contents. A master site development plan containing the information required by the provisions of article XIV, subsection 14-103.2, shall be prepared and submitted to the Planning Commission for review and approval along with a sketch plat as required by the subdivision regulations. In addition to the information required to meet the provisions of subsection 14-103.2, the master development plan shall show: 
i.  Topographic features, both existing and proposed, with contours of not more than two-foot intervals where slopes average 12 percent or less and five-foot intervals in areas where slopes are greater than 12 percent. 
ii.  Location of any open space that is proposed to be held in common ownership. 
iii.  Proposed ground coverage, floor area and heights of all buildings. 
iv.  Where any lot or roadway is proposed for location upon any portion of the site where the natural topography exceeds 12 percent such alteration shall be evaluated by a licensed geotechnical engineer and a report of findings and recommendations submitted with the plan of development. 
b.  Coordinated review. Upon receipt of a master site development plan and sketch plat containing information as required above, the Planning Commission may: 
i.  Concurrently review the site development plan and sketch plat; 
ii.  Jointly approve, approve with modification, or disapprove these documents; and 
iii.  In the instance of approval, or approval with modification, transfer the site development plan to the Zoning Administrator for enforcement. 
c.  Enforcement. Upon approval of a master site development plan, the Zoning Administrator shall note the boundary and extent of such development upon the official zoning map and shall become responsible for enforcement of the plan. Only minimal adjustments involving the placement of any structure will be permitted once a site development plan has been approved. Any other change shall require submission of a proposed amendment to the approved plan. 
3.  Development standards. The following standards and requirements shall apply to all developments subject to the provisions of this section: 
a.  General standards for development. In the interest of promoting the most appropriate and economical use of the land while assuring that the character of the residential district is maintained, the Planning Commission in its review of a proposed development shall consider the following: 
i.  Protection of the character, property values, privacy and other characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood; 
ii.  Provision for surface drainage control, sewage disposal and water supply, recreation and traffic control; and 
iii.  Preservation and protection of existing trees, ground cover, top soil, streams, rock outcroppings and scenic or historic sites from dangers and damage caused by excessive and poorly planned grading for streets and building sites. 
b.  Availability of public utilities. Generally all public utilities, specifically including water and a central sewage collection and treatment system shall be available at the site. Where public sewer is not available, no lot or housing site may be created which has less area than the greater of, 30,000 square feet or that required to meet standards of the County Department of Environment and Conservation. All septic fields for each dwelling unit shall be located within the area of fee simple ownership of said dwelling unit. 
c.  Permitted density. The density permitted is intended to be consistent with that allowed within conventional developments offering no common open space. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted shall be computed as follows: 
i.  From the gross acreage available within the development shall be subtracted: any portion of the site where the full use of the land is not available to the landowner because of restrictions thereon; specifically including any portion of the site which lies within a floodway district. 
ii.  The area remaining after the above adjustments shall be divided by the minimum lot area per family for the applicable dwelling unit type and zone district in which the dwelling unit is located. For developments located in more than one zoning district, the density shall be computed separately for that portion of the development lying within each district. No developmental density may be transferred across zoning district boundaries. 
d.  Minimum lot area. Within all developments approved under the provisions of this section the minimum area of lots designated as residential building sites shall be as follows: 
i.  Lots served by public sewer. The minimum size of lots served by public sewer shall be as indicated in table 5-104.3a. 
ii.  Lots served by on-site sewage disposal systems. The minimum size of lots served by on-site sewage disposal systems shall be the greater of, 30,000 square feet or the area required to meet standards of the County Department of Environment and Conservation. 
e.  Lot width and yard requirements. Within any development approved under the provisions of this section the following yard requirements shall apply: 
i.  Lots adjacent to conventional residential development. All lots located along the periphery of a development site adjacent to or directly across a street from existing conventional residential lots shall have minimum width, measured at the setback line, equal to 90 percent of the width required by the basic provisions established for the district within which the development is located. Such lots shall contain at least 80 percent of the minimum lot area required by the basic provisions established for the district within which the development is located. 
ii.  All other lots. The provisions for spacing of buildings set forth in subpart f (below) shall apply to all buildings and structures approved under the provisions of this section. 
f.  Building spacing. The minimum space between any two buildings shall be the greater of that required to meet the minimum distances established in table 5-104.3a, or the separation required by adopted building and fire codes. 
g.  Lot coverage. Lot coverage shall not exceed the [following] maximum building envelope standards in table 5-104.3a:

ARTICLE VI. - COMMERCIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 6-101. - Purposes of commercial districts. 
    6-101.1 General purposes. The commercial districts established by this ordinance are designed to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity and other aspects of the general welfare. These goals include, among others, the following: 
1.  To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations in proximity to established residential areas, for local retail and service trades catering specifically to the recurring shopping needs of the occupants of nearby residences. 
2.  To protect both retail and service developments and nearby residences against fire, explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation and other hazards, and against offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust and other particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare and other objectionable influences. 
3.  To protect both retail and service developments and nearby residences against congestion, by regulating the intensity of retail and service developments consistent with their marketing functions, by restricting those types of establishments which generate heavy traffic, and by providing for off-street parking and loading facilities. 
4.  To provide sufficient and appropriate space, and in particular sufficient area, to meet the area's expected future need for modern, planned commercial floor space, including the need for off-street parking space in areas where a large proportion of customers come by automobile, and to encourage the tendency of commercial establishments to concentrate in integrated planned developments, to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants. 
5.  To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for commercial districts to satisfy specific functional needs of the area, and in particular the need for medical services, and the needs of the general public traveling along major thoroughfares. 
6.  To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for the mixture of compatible residential and restricted commercial developments where standards for development will provide protection for the environmental essentials of either. 
7.  To provide appropriate locations for transitional uses intervening between commercial developments and residential areas, and thereby alleviate the friction inherent between dissimilar activities. 
8.  To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for all types of commercial and miscellaneous service activities. 
9.  To provide freedom of architectural design, in order to encourage the development of more attractive, efficient and economic building forms, within appropriate standards which ensure that buildings are in character with their surroundings. 
10.  To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development in accord with a well considered plan, to promote stability of commercial development, to strengthen the economic base of the area, to protect the character of the districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of land and buildings. 
    6-101.2 Specific purposes. 
1.  CG, Commercial-General Districts. This district is designed to provide for a wide range of commercial uses concerned with retail trade and consumer services; amusement and entertainment establishments; automotive and vehicular service establishments; transient sleeping accommodations; drive-in stores; eating and drinking places, financial institutions; and offices. The uses in this district service a broad market spectrum and, therefore, ease of automotive access is a requirement. However, it is not intended that this district permit uses which generate large volumes of truck traffic. Community facilities and utilities necessary to serve these districts, or necessary for the general community welfare are also permitted. Appropriate open space between commercial and residential areas is required. This classification is intended to recognize an existing undesirable development pattern but not repeat or significantly expand the pattern beyond those areas where such is already established. 
2.  CI, Commercial Interchange Districts. This district is designed to provide adequate space at major freeway interchanges for uses which serve the needs of the motoring public. Automobile and other vehicular service establishments, transient sleeping accommodations, and eating and drinking establishments primarily characterize this district. In addition, commercial trade and service uses are permitted if necessary to serve the recurring needs of persons frequenting these districts. Community facilities and utilities necessary to serve these districts, or necessary for the general community welfare are also permitted. Bulk limitations required of uses in these districts, in part, are designed to maximize building in proximate residential districts. Appropriate locations for this district are near major transportation interchanges in clustered development patterns and not patterns of striped commercial development extending in a continuous manner along major traffic arteries. 
3.  CMU, Commercial Mixed Use Districts. These districts are designed primarily to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for establishments and uses engaged in general retail, restaurant, professional offices, commercial services, residential dwellings, and services ancillary thereto. As these districts tend to generate relatively large volumes of vehicular traffic and may have other characteristics detrimental to residential environments, their locations are most suitable on properties with sufficient frontage on arterial streets. Where these districts must necessarily abut existing or proposed residential areas external to the development, efforts to minimize incompatibility shall be made by providing appropriate buffers and through proper site design. In addition, a selection of community facilities and utilities considered necessary to service the principal uses in these districts or necessary for the general community welfare, are permitted. Mixed-use developments may be permitted through the planned unit development process as described in [section] 8-207 of this [Zoning] Ordinance. 
4.  CNS, Convenience Neighborhood Service Districts. These districts are intended to provide locations for retail and personal service operations serving a limited market area and engaged in the retail sale of goods and/or services from the site of frequently and recurrently needed items for personal consumption or household use. The permitted establishments are those which provide for regular local shopping and which, therefore, are visited frequently by customers. Community facilities and utilities necessary to serve these districts, or necessary for the general community welfare are also permitted. These districts may occur along and at the intersection of arterial and community collector streets, characteristically are small, and are widely distributed throughout the community for convenient accessibility. It is expressly intended that these districts be limited in gross land area and building bulk so as to maintain compatibility with the surrounding residential environment. The bulk regulations are established to provide for maximum compatibility between the commercial activity in these districts and adjacent residential activity. The establishment of a new district of this nature must be preceded by the development of residential areas capable of supporting the proposed activities. 
5.  OPS, Office/Professional Service Districts. These districts are designed to provide for transitional uses between more intensive commercial activities occurring along major traffic arteries and residential areas. The permitted uses are ones which tend to produce relatively low volumes of traffic. In addition to the office activities, certain community facilities are permitted which are compatible with other uses permitted within these districts. The intensity of use and building bulk permitted within these districts is controlled by more restrictive regulation consistent with their intended transitional function. 
6.  CTC, Commercial Town Center Districts. This district is designed to provide for a wide range of commercial uses concerned with retail trade and consumer services; amusement and entertainment establishments; eating and drinking places, financial institutions; and offices. The uses in this district service a broad market spectrum and, therefore, ease of automotive access is a requirement. Community facilities and utilities necessary to serve these districts, or necessary for the general community welfare are also permitted. Mixed-use developments may be permitted through the planned unit development process as described in [section] 8-207 of this [Zoning] Ordinance. Appropriate open space between commercial and residential areas is required. 
7.  CRC, Commercial Retail Center Districts. These districts are designed to provide for a wide range of commercial uses concerned with retail trade and consumer services; eating and drinking establishments, financial institutions, offices, drive-in stores and general retail. The uses in this district service a broad market spectrum and, therefore, ease of automotive access is a requirement. However, it is not intended that this district permit uses which generate large volumes of truck traffic. Community facilities and utilities necessary to serve these districts, or necessary for the general community welfare, are also permitted. Appropriate open space between commercial and residential area is required. This classification is intended to allow for thoroughfare retail uses not permitted in CTC or OPS districts, while recognizing the existence of nearby or adjacent residential areas.

    6-102.2 Principal permitted uses (P). Principal permitted uses are permitted as a matter of right within the district indicated, subject to the general requirements established for the district wherein the use is located. 
    6-102.3 Uses permitted with supplemental provisions (SUP). A use permitted with conditions is an activity, use or structure which is permitted subject to a finding by the Zoning Administrator that the specific standards indicated for the use in question have been met. Only those uses and structures so indicated in table 6-102A, may be allowed within the districts indicated. 
    6-102.4 Conditional uses (C). A conditional use is an activity, use, or structure which may require large land area, have unique operating, traffic generating or other characteristics that may tend to dominate or adversely affect the area more than do other uses permitted within the same zone district. Because the impacts of these uses cannot be satisfactorily predetermined for every possible location within a zone district, these land uses are permitted only upon approval by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals. Each conditional use is subject to a finding by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals that the specific standards indicated for the use in question have been met. Only those uses and structures so indicated in table 6-102A, may be allowed within the districts indicated. 
    6-102.5 Accessory uses. In addition to the principal activities expressed above, each activity type shall be deemed to include activities customarily associated with, and appropriate, incidental, and subordinate to the principal activity when such accessory activity is located on the same zone lot as such principal activity and meets the further conditions set forth in article III, section 3-105. Accessory uses designated with the letter "P" in table 6-102A, are permitted as a matter of right and no permit is required to conduct the activity in question. Those accessory uses designated with the letters "ASP" require a permit obtained from the Office of the Zoning Administrator. Permits for accessory uses designated "ASP" shall be issued upon demonstration that the activity in question meets the requirements established for such activity article III, section 3-105. The third classification of accessory uses designated by the letter "C" require approval as a conditional use by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Upon issuance of any permit for a conditional accessory use such use or activity shall be continuously subject to compliance with any operational standard or criteria established by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals. 
    6-102.6 Temporary uses. The temporary uses and structures specified in article III, section 3-106, as permissible within residential districts may be permitted for the limited time periods indicated for each such use or activity. 
    6-102.7 Uses not permitted. Any uses or structures not allowable as permitted uses, conditional uses, temporary uses or accessory uses are prohibited within the various commercial districts.

Juliet and within the jurisdiction of the Regional Planning Commission shall include construction of all greenway sections that are included in the current and in any future greenway plans for the city. In any development, all parcels of land which touch or lie within the proposed route of a new greenway shall be constructed by the developer. Construction and related expenses for design, acquisition of right-of-way and construction of the greenways will be the responsibility of the developer. All greenway sections will be constructed per current City of Mt. Juliet, TDOT and FHWA standards and specifications, whichever is greater. Examples of said specifications include, but are not limited to, design, materials, thickness and width of greenway, as well as required signage, meeting ADA requirements, etc. Construction of said greenway sections will be completed by ten percent of development build out and all greenway sections will be dedicated to the City of Mt. Juliet. The developer, property owner or their designated agent may request a waiver or variance from this ten percent requirement should the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship. Said waiver, variance or adjustment will not adversely affect the community objectives of the comprehensive plan.

No. 2016-40, § 3, 8-8-2016) 
Sec. 6-104. - Supplemental design provisions. 
    6-104.1 Mixed-use development standards for density, height, lot size and open space. The provisions of this section apply to any mixed-use development located on any zone lot or portion of a zone lot in any commercial district. 
1.  Provisions applicable to mixed-use developments. The provisions appearing below shall apply to all mixed-use developments (buildings and/or sites) where such are permitted within any commercial district. 
a.  Maximum bulk permitted. For any mixed-use development the height, density, bulk, lot size and open space provisions applicable to the RM-16 district (see article V, table 5-103a) shall apply. Unless modified through the PUD process these provisions and the provisions of [subsection] 5-104.1, Development standards for multi-family dwellings, shall apply. 
b.  Calculation of residential density. To determine the residential density permitted within any mixed-use development the following procedure shall be utilized: 
i.  The zone lot upon which the development is located will be apportioned as to its nonresidential-residential components as follows: 
a)  For a site containing mixed-use buildings the total GFA (gross floor area) will be calculated and the percent commercial/residential determined. The percent residential GFA will then be applied to the total acreage of the site. This acreage will be used to calculate the maximum density. A minimum of five percent of the GFA of the entire site shall be commercial. 
b)  For a mixed-use site a determination will be made as to the area of the property used for commercial/residential activities. The acreage used for residential uses will be used to calculate the maximum density. A minimum of ten percent of a site shall be used for commercial activities and uses. 
c)  For the development scenarios in 'a' and 'b' above, and variations thereto, the Zoning Administrator shall make a final determination on the methodology for calculating density. 
d)  The residential density approved for any project will be subject to review and approval by the Board of Commissioners based on the quality and characteristics of the project. The Board of Commissioners is under no obligation to approve the maximum allowable density for a project. 
ii.  The residential density permitted will then be calculated in a like manner as for any zone lot located within said district. 
iii.  In no instance, however, shall the total building bulk permitted be increased beyond that established for the district within which the mixed building(s) is located. 
c.  Applicability. The requirement in table 6-102A for a mixed-use building or mixed-use site to be approved through the PUD process contained in article VIII of the Zoning Ordinance shall not authorize such uses without the development being submitted as: 1) part of a new PUD application, or 2) an amendment (per subsection 8.203.11) to an existing PUD. In either case, mixed-use developments shall not be authorized without specific action by the board of commissioners. An existing PUD, although it may contain CMU base zoning, shall not be exempt from this requirement. 
    6-104.2 Development standards for commercial complexes. 
1.  Purpose. The provisions of this section are applicable to all commercial complexes as defined by this ordinance (see article II, section 2-102). The intent of this provision is to ensure coordination of certain critical design elements within commercial complexes by Planning Commission review of the master development plan required for all such development by article XIV, subsection 14-103.3. Provided, however, that in any instance where this use is located within a planned unit development this requirement may be fulfilled by submission of the plans required by that section. 
2.  Parking and access control. The parking and access control provisions contained in article IX, subsection 9-102.7, Joint parking facilities, shall apply within all commercial complexes. 
3.  Design standards. The following design standards shall apply to all development plans submitted for property located within any commercial complex: 
a.  Site drainage shall be designed to incorporate all buildings and structures included with the total development site. In that site drainage may adversely affect other off-site properties, the Planning Commission may require the developer of the commercial complex to post a pre-construction performance bond to ensure the proper completion of drainage improvements. 
b.  All commercial complexes shall be subject to the design standards in article VI, [sub]section 6-103.7. 
4.  Standards for internal walkways. The following design standards for internal walkways shall apply within all commercial complexes: 
a.  Walkways, a minimum of five feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to the building. At a minimum these walkways shall connect street crossings to the major points of building entry. 
b.  Walkways shall be provided along the full length of the building on any side which provides building access to the public or where public parking is available, to provide safe and comfortable pedestrian access to the building. 
c.  Internal walkway surfaces shall be designed to be visually attractive and distinguishable from driving surfaces through use of durable, low maintenance materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort. 
    6-104.3 Special provisions applicable to CNS, Convenience Neighborhood Service and OPS Office/Professional Service Districts. 
1.  Purpose. The special provisions set forth herein are intended to provide design criteria for commercial activities proposed for location on a zone lot or portion of a zone lot within Convenience Neighborhood Service (CNS) or Office/Professional Service (OPS) Districts. It is the express purpose of these provisions to establish design criteria and to provide for implementation of these provisions by review of the site plan required by article XIV, subsection 14-103.3. Provided, however, that in any instance where this use is located within a planned unit development this requirement may be fulfilled by submission of the plans required by those sections. 
2.  Design criteria, general. It is intended that commercial activities when permitted within these districts generally shall be small, unobstructive and produce negligible off-site impact. To this end, no individual commercial establishment shall be of such size or character as to create the impression of general commercial development. In addition, hours of operation, outdoor display of goods, signage and lighting shall be restricted so as to reduce or eliminate possible negative influences upon the surrounding residential neighborhood. 
3.  Design criteria, detailed. 
a.  Location. These facilities are intended to meet the very limited function of providing convenience goods and services to the surrounding residents. The locations for these operations are limited to intersections of arterial or major collector streets which are identified on the latest adopted major street plan. 
b.  Maximum size of establishments. No individual commercial establishment in CNS districts shall have a gross floor area exceeding 5,000 square feet. There shall be no size limitation for commercial establishments located in OPS districts. 
c.  Building design. Buildings must be constructed of masonry and wood and shall be residential in scale and architectural design. 
d.  Conduct of operations. All sales, service, or display in connection with commercial establishments shall be within completely enclosed buildings, and there shall be no display, service, or storage outside such buildings. No public address systems or other devices for reproducing or amplifying voices or music shall be mounted outside such buildings or be audible beyond any line of the lot on which the building is situated. 
e.  Exterior storage. Exterior storage of goods or materials of any kind is prohibited. Placement of waste disposal facilities is permitted in the rear of the commercial operation only and shall not be located in any front or side yard. Such facilities shall be totally screened using similar exterior materials from which the outside walls of the principal building is constructed and shall be maintained in a clean and orderly manner. 
f.  Lighting. During hours of darkness when convenience establishments are in operation, parking areas and pedestrian ways on the premises shall be lighted to an intensity of at least 0.6 footcandle. No such lighting shall be directed in a manner which illuminates adjoining residential premises and no source of incandescent or mercury vapor illumination shall be directly visible from any residential property, or from any street. No neon lights inside or outside structures shall be visible from any residential property, or from any street. 
g.  Noise. No noise detectable at the property line may be generated on the site. 
h.  Special sign provisions. No signs intended to be read from off the premises shall be permitted in connection with convenience establishments except one sign, not exceeding 16 square feet in area, mounted flat against the side of the building, for each face of the building exposed to a public street. Where more than one convenience establishment is located in the same building, signs in accordance with the above formula may be permitted for each. No such sign shall extend or be mounted above or beyond the wall of the building. 
4.  Special parking provisions. Where any commercial use or activity permitted within a CNS or OPS district adjoins any existing residential use, the following special provisions may be utilized, singly or in combination, in order to offset any negative impacts of the parking upon the use and enjoyment of the adjoining residential activity: 
a.  Parking shall be restricted or prohibited within front or side yards which adjoin a residential use or activity. 
b.  No parking area may be located within any buffer yard required by the provisions of subsection 6-103.4, subpart 6, Special provisions applying to required yards and building setbacks along district boundaries coincident with side or rear lot line of zone lot in any residential district. 
c.  Off-site parking may be located on a lot other than the same lot to which the spaces are accessory provided that: 
i.  Such spaces are located in a mixed-use or commercial district; 
ii.  Such spaces are located to draw a minimum of vehicular traffic to and through streets having predominantly residential frontage; 
iii.  Such spaces are located no farther than 400 feet from the nearest boundary of the lot occupied by the activities to which they are accessory; 
iv.  Such spaces are in the same ownership as the uses to which they are accessory and necessary instruments are executed to ensure the required number of spaces will remain available throughout the life of such uses; and 
v.  Such spaces conform to all applicable district regulations of the district in which they are located. 
5.  Special yard requirements. Along such portions of the boundary of any CNS or OPS district where such lot abuts or is contiguous to any residential zone lot, [a] buffer yard, as required by subpart 6 of subsection 6-103.4, shall be required. Such yards may be used only for purposes of screening. 
6.  Maximum size of CNS, Convenience Neighborhood Service Districts. Due to limited service nature of the CNS, Convenience Neighborhood Service District and the potential for negative impact upon nearby residential activities no CCNS, Convenience Neighborhood Service District shall be created which exceeds two acres in size.

ARTICLE VII. - INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 7-101. - Purposes of industrial districts. 
    7-101.1 General purposes. The industrial districts established by this ordinance are designed to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity and other aspects of the general welfare. These goals include, among others, the following: 
1.  To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the needs of the area for all types of distributive, industrial and related activities, with due allowance for the need for choice of suitable sites. 
2.  To protect distributive, industrial and related activities, as well as residential and related activities by providing for separation of these uses, and, as far as possible, provide that appropriate space needs for distributive and industrial activities are available by prohibiting the use of such space for residential purposes. 
3.  To encourage industrial development which is free from danger of fire, explosions, toxic or noxious matter, radiation, smoke, dust or other particulate matter, and other hazards, and from offensive noise, vibration, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare, and other objectionable influences, by permitting such development in areas where this ordinance restricts the emission of such nuisances, without regard to the industrial products and processes involved. 
4.  To protect adjacent residential and commercial areas, and to protect the labor force in other establishments engaged in less offensive types of industrial and related activities, by restricting those industrial activities which involve danger of fire, explosions, toxic or noxious matter, radiation, smoke, dust, or other particulate matter, and other hazards, or create offensive noise, vibration, heat, humidity, glare, and other objectionable influences, by permitting such development in areas where this ordinance restricts the emission of such nuisances, without regard to the industrial products or processes involved. 
5.  To protect industrial activities and related developments against congestion, as far as is possible and appropriate in each area, by limiting the bulk of buildings in relation to the land around them and to one another, and by requiring space off public ways for parking and loading facilities associated with such activities. 
6.  To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development, to promote stability of industrial and related development, to strengthen the economic base of the area, to protect the character of these districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of land and buildings and to protect the City's tax revenues. 
7.  To protect adjacent residential and commercial districts from any negative impacts attributable to sites devoted to industrial activities. 
    7-101.2 Specific purposes. 
1.  I-R, Restrictive Industrial Districts. This class of district is intended to provide space for a wide range of industrial and related uses that conform to a high level of performance criteria and have the least objectionable characteristics. These districts may provide a buffer between other districts and other industrial activities that have more objectionable influences. Except as specified in article III, subsection 3-105.2, subpart 6, Residential occupancy in connection with nonresidential activity, new residential activities are excluded, and community facilities and commercial establishments which provide needed services for industry and are complementary thereto are permitted. 
2.  I-G, General Industrial Districts. This class of district is intended to provide space for the types of industrial activities which by reason of volume of raw materials or freight, scale of operation, type of structures required, or other similar characteristics require locations relatively well segregated from nonindustrial uses. Except as specified in article III, subsection 3-105.2, subpart 8, Residential occupancy in connection with nonresidential activity, new residential activities are excluded, and commercial establishments and community facilities which provide needed services for industry and are complementary thereto are permitted. 
3.  I-S, Special Industrial Districts. This class of district is intended to provide suitable areas for intense, potentially noxious and/or dangerous industrial operations, including open land operations. It is specifically intended that all newly created districts be so located as to prevent negative impact upon adjoining uses. To this end, these districts are to be protected from encroachment by other activities. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 7-101.2) 
Sec. 7-102. - Uses and structures. 
    7-102.1 General provisions. Principal uses of buildings or other structures and land have been classified and combined into major classes and activity types in article III of this ordinance. The procedure for interpreting the classes and type of activities is provided in article III, section 3-101, table 7-102A, presents a tabulation of uses and structures which are classified as principal permitted (P), permitted with supplemental provisions (SUP) or conditional (C) uses within the various industrial districts. The supplemental design provisions with which (SUP) and (C) uses and activities are required to comply appear in article III, section 3-104, Supplemental use regulations. 
    7-102.2 Principal permitted uses (P). Principal permitted uses are permitted as a matter of right within the district indicated, subject to the general requirements established for the district wherein the use is located. 
    7-102.3 Uses permitted with supplemental provisions (SUP). A use permitted with supplemental provisions is an activity, use or structure which is permitted subject to a finding by the Zoning Administrator that the specific standards indicated for the use in question have been met. Only those uses and structures so indicated in table 7-102A, may be allowed within the districts indicated. 
    7-102.4 Conditional uses (C). A conditional use is an activity, use, or structure which may require large land area, have unique operating, traffic generating or other characteristics that may tend to dominate or adversely affect the area more than do other uses permitted within the same zone district. Because the impacts of these uses cannot be satisfactorily predetermined for every possible location within a zone district, these land uses are permitted only upon approval by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals. Only those uses and structures so indicated in table 7-102A, may be allowed within the districts indicated. 
    7-102.5 Accessory uses. In addition to the principal activities expressed above, each activity type shall be deemed to include activities customarily associated with, and appropriate, incidental, and subordinate to the principal activity when such accessory activity is located on the same zone lot as such principal activity and meets the further conditions set forth in article III, section 3-105. Permits for accessory uses designated "ASP" shall be issued upon demonstration that the activity in question meets the requirements established for such activity article III, section 3-105. The third classification of accessory uses designated by the letter "C" require[s] approval as a conditional use by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Upon issuance of any permit for a conditional accessory use such use or activity shall be continuously subject to compliance with any operational standard or criteria established by the Board of [Zoning] Appeals.

Sec. 7-104. - Supplemental provisions. 
    7-104.1 Development standards for I-S, Special Industrial Districts. 
1.  Operation and intent. The I-S, Special Industrial District, is intended to provide a mechanism for managing a wide variety of high impact, potentially noxious and/or dangerous, but necessary uses. Certain of the potential uses that may locate within the district have associated with them some special impact or potential hazard related to materials, processes or products which can not be evaluated as to effect on the surrounding area or environment in advance of the use being proposed for a particular location. At the time an application is filed for approval of an I-S district, a review of the location, design configuration and its impact will be conducted. This evaluation shall consider the proposed use, the site development plan required for all such development by article XIV, subsection 14-103.3, and all operational and environmental data required to be submitted. The express goal of this review is to determine appropriate design criteria and environmental safeguards to be applied to such use in order to protect the health and safety of the public at large. The review will formulate a basis for a detailed recommendation to the Board of Commissioners as to conditions under which the proposed use may be permitted to locate within the planning jurisdiction through creation of an I-S, Special Industrial District. 
2.  Development plans and review process. 
a.  Procedure for submission and review. The process for review and approval of any I-S, Special Industrial District, consists of three progressive elements: 
i.  Review and recommendation of a preliminary site development plan containing the information required by article XIV, subsection 14-103.3, and all operational and environmental data required by subpart 2 of this section. 
ii.  Consideration by the Board of Commissioners of the requested I-S district, as specified in this section. 
iii.  Review and approval of a final site development plan as specified herein. 
b.  Operational data required. Sufficient information shall be presented to fully divulge the operational nature, intensity and ultimate extent of the proposed activity. This information shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
i.  The nature of materials to be utilized and processes involved in the proposed operation, to specifically include a detailed listing of types and expected quantities of all materials classified as hazardous by the Federal Department of Environmental Protection or by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conversation. 
ii.  Average number of vehicles entering and leaving the site on a daily basis and the anticipated routes of travel. 
iii.  Detailing of types and current status of all federal and state permits required for operation of the proposed facility. 
iv.  Detailing of all safety and protective measures to be utilized in connection with the operation as well as an indication of the system proposed for dealing with complaints. 
v.  A general indication of the anticipated duration of the proposed use and, details of plans and methodologies proposed for removal of the activity and/or reclamation of the site. 
vi.  A listing of the type and quantity of emissions expected to be released from the site. 
vii.  Effects of the proposed use on groundwater and air quality. 
viii.  Effects on surface water runoff and potential for any contamination of the same. 
ix.  A detailed listing of soils and geological conditions found upon the site. 
c.  Planning Commission recommendation. The Planning Commission shall consider the preliminary site development plan and forward a detailed recommendation concerning its disposition to the Board of Commissioners. This recommendation may contain suggestions for specific conditions and/or limitations to be applied to the use should the Board of Commissioners approve the zoning request. 
d.  Action by Board of Commissioners. After review and recommendation by the Planning Commission, the applicant may proceed to the Board of Commissioners with the proposal. At the meeting of the Board where the proposal is presented, the preliminary site development plan along with the action recommended by the Planning Commission shall be presented for review. The Board of Commissioners may approve or disapprove the proposal, or in an instance where the Planning Commission has recommended approval with conditions or recommendations for alterations, the Board may establish specific conditions within the purview of this ordinance for approval. 
Upon action by the Board of Commissioners approving the site development plan and the proposed change in zoning classification, the applicant may proceed to prepare and present to the Planning Commission a final site development plan. In no event shall a building permit be issued for any portion of a development subject to this procedure until a final site development plan has been approved. 
In the event that the action by the Board of Commissioners is a conditional approval, such conditions shall be agreed to in writing by the applicant before the zoning approval shall become final. Moreover, such acceptance by the applicant shall cause the activity to be continuously subject to compliance with the conditions set out in the grant of approval (and accepted by the applicant). Any violation of these conditions shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance to be punished as set out in article XIV. 
e.  Special information required for final site development plan. Following the action by the Board of Commissioners creating the I-S district, the applicant may proceed to prepare and present for review by the Planning Commission a final site development plan. Such plan shall contain the information specified in article XIV, section 14-103. Additionally, all such plans shall contain the following: 
i.  Approved state and federal permits. Copies of all permits required by state and federal law for operation of the facility shall be provided. 
ii.  Site restoration or reclamation plan. Depending upon the nature of the proposed use, a site restoration or reclamation plan may be required as a condition of zoning approval. Where such is required, said plan shall accompany the final development plan. Adequate provision, as determined by the City Attorney, shall be made to ensure implementation of said plan regardless of the future financial capabilities of the applicant. 
f.  Review of approval action. In the event that any site development plan shall be disapproved, such action shall, upon request by the applicant, be reviewed by the Board of Commissioners. The Board shall consider the report submitted by the Planning Commission and such other information as it may require in order to determine whether such development in its view meets the test of substantial compliance and complies with other standards of review, herein, established. Should the Board of Commissioners uphold the Planning Commission in its action, it shall notify the applicant that final approval of the development plan is denied. Should the Board of Commissioners override the Planning Commission's recommendation to disapprove the plan, it shall notify both the applicant and the Planning Commission of its decision and the action of the Board of Commissioners approving the plan shall become final. 
3.  Site location and design. 
a.  General location criteria. Any site proposed for classification as an I-S, Special Industrial District shall meet the following criteria: 
i.  The proposed site will be located in areas apart from concentrations of residential developments and community facilities where concentrations of people will be present. 
ii.  The proposed use will not pollute or deteriorate air quality, surface or subterranean water, or any other natural features. 
iii.  The proposed site will not be located in an area that could contaminate the source of an existing public water supply.

ARTICLE VIII. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

Sec. 8-101. - Operation and intent of overlay districts. 
    8-101.1 Purpose and intent. Overlay districts are hereby established as a means of addressing specific aspects of land use control or development that transcend conventional zoning district provisions. Included are overlay district provisions that permit greater design flexibility; an overlay to protect areas subject to flooding; and an overlay district designed to regulate the location of adult entertainment establishments. 
    8-101.2 Applicability. An overlay district shall represent a mapped geographic area depicted upon the official zoning map. Overlay districts may be applied to the base zone districts so indicated by this ordinance and may encompass one or more of those districts. Unless expressly stated to the contrary in this article, all lands encumbered by an overlay district shall conform to all other applicable provisions of this ordinance. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 8-101) 
Sec. 8-201. - Planned unit development districts. 
    8-201.1 General provisions. 
1.  Intent and purpose. The PUD, Planned Unit Development District regulations are an alternative zoning process that allows for development of land in a well planned and coordinated manner. This procedure is intended to provide opportunities for more efficient utilization of land than would otherwise be the case under the conventional provisions of this ordinance. The planned unit development provisions permit a greater mixing of land uses not easily accomplished by the application of conventional zoning district boundaries, or a framework for coordinating the development of land with provision of adequate roadways and public services. In return, the PUD districts require a high standard for protection and preservation of environmentally sensitive lands, well planned living, working and shopping environments and timely provision of essential utilities and streets. 
2.  Consistency with the general plan and area development plans. No planned unit development shall be approved unless all plans for development are found to be consistent with the then current issue of the General Plan for the City and any adopted special development plans for the area in which the planned unit development is proposed. The Planning Commission shall make a formal, written finding regarding consistency of any proposed planned unit development, said report to include findings that the development: 
a.  Will be consistent with the currently effective General Plan as well as any special development plan for the area. 
b.  Is likely to be compatible with development permitted under the general development provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
c.  Will not significantly interfere with the use and enjoyment of other land in the vicinity. 
3.  Application of the district. 
a.  General[ly]. A Planned Unit Development Overlay District may be applied over any base zoning district established in article IV of this ordinance. 
b.  Provisions may be made mandatory. In the event that the adopted development plan for an area where any development is proposed so recommends, the Board of Commissioners shall require that all petitions for reclassifications of land within the area shall be formulated and administered in accordance with this section, including any amendments thereto. As appropriate for their respective areas, adopted development plans shall also contain recommendations which may differ from or supplement provisions of this article respecting new or modified PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts; design standards for signage, setbacks, parking and other matters, to be made applicable either area-wide or within particular PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts, or both. The Board of Commissioners shall not entertain proposals for reclassification of land within such areas until it has formally acted upon these recommendations. 
4.  Relation of planned unit development regulations to general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations; variations on equal satisfaction of public purposes. The planned unit development regulations that follow shall apply generally to the initiation and regulation of all PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts. Where there are conflicts between the special planned unit development regulations herein and general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements, these regulations shall apply in PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts. 
Where actions, designs, or solutions proposed by the applicant are not literally in accord with applicable planned unit development or general regulations, but the Board of Commissioners makes a finding in the particular case that public purposes are satisfied to an equivalent or greater degree, the Board may make specific modification of the regulations in the particular case, provided that where floor area and similar ratios (other than off-street parking) have been established by these regulations, the Board shall not act in a particular case to modify such ratios. 
Except as indicated above, notwithstanding procedures and requirements generally in effect, procedures and requirements set forth herein and in guides and standards officially adopted as part of regulations for particular classes of PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts shall apply in PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts, to any amendments creating such districts and to issuance of all required permits therein. 
5.  Jurisdiction of Planning Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals. Those activities which require conditional use permits under various provisions of this ordinance may be permitted within planned unit developments provided that such activities are approved initially as part of the master development plan by the Planning Commission and the Board of Commissioners. Thereafter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may approve such uses. 
6.  Ownership and division of land. No tract of land may receive preliminary approval as a planned unit development, unless such tract is under the unified control of a "landholder" as defined by this ordinance. Unless, otherwise, provided as a condition of approval of a planned unit development, the landholder of an approved planned unit development may divide and transfer parts of such development. The transferee shall complete each such unit, and shall use and maintain it in strict conformance with the adopted master development plan. A report identifying all property owners within the area of the proposed district and giving evidence of unified control of its entire area shall be submitted along with any application for approval of a master development plan. The report shall state agreement of all present property owners and/or their successors in title: 
a.  To proceed with the proposed development according to the regulations in effect when the map amendment, including such modifications as are set by the Board of Commissioners in the course of such action creating the PUD, Planned Unit Development District, becomes effective. 
b.  To provide bonds, dedications, guarantees, agreements, contracts and deed restrictions acceptable to the Board of Commissioners in the course of such action. 
c.  To bind further successors in title to any commitments under subparts a and b, above. 
7.  Staging of development. The Planning Commission may elect to permit staging of the development, in which case, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Each stage shall be so planned and so related to existing surroundings and available facilities and services that failure to proceed with subsequent stages will not have an adverse impact on the planned unit development or its surroundings. 
b.  Each stage of the development shall, at the time of approval of any final site development plan for any portion of that stage, be assured adequate public services to serve all development proposed for that stage. 
8.  Status of previously approved PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts. Any Planned Unit Development District which was approved under the provisions of Ordinance No. 86-21, as amended, and is not completely developed at the time of approval of this ordinance may continue under the development plan as approved. In any instance, however, where a change in the approved development plan is proposed such change shall conform to the provisions of this ordinance.

In any instance where the Board of Commissioners may act either to approve a proposed development which the Planning Commission had recommended for disapproval or to conditionally approve the proposed development plan, the Board shall provide specific guidance to the Planning Commission relative to: 
a.  Overall design of the plan; 
b.  Any modifications required; and 
c.  Any additional information which may be required by the Planning Commission in order for it to determine substantial compliance between the preliminary and final development plan. 
7.  Planned unit development and the official zoning map. Upon approval by the Board of Commissioners, the Zoning Administrator shall place the extent of the planned unit development on the official zoning map identified by the ordinance number providing approval. Similarly in the instance of action by the Planning Commission abolishing or removing the planned unit development, the zoning administrator shall remove the PUD district from the official zoning map. 
8.  Recording of PUD district. Within 60 days following enactment of an adopting ordinance by the Board of Commissioners, all owners shall record with the Register of Deeds a boundary plat or suitably comparable document identifying that the affected properties are subject to the provisions of a Planned Unit Development Overlay District.

9.  Addition of land uses not included within an approved preliminary master development plan or listing of alternative uses allowable within the base zoning district. The proposed addition of any use not authorized within an approved preliminary development plan and accompanying listing of alternative nonresidential land uses may be added to the plan only when approved as provided, herein. The Planning Commission shall hear all such proposed amendments. In the course of its consideration of any alteration presented hereunder, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing. Said hearing is held for the purpose of making a recommendation to the Board of Commissioners as to disposition of the requested change. The action by the Planning Commission on the request for change shall be in the form of a resolution to the Board of Commissioners for amendment of the approved preliminary development plan. A report detailing the action recommended by the Planning Commission shall accompany the submission of Board of Commissioners. 
    8-203.4 Final approval of a proposed planned unit development. The approval by the Board of Commissioners of the preliminary development plan shall authorize and form the basis for the Planning Commission's final approval of said development. The final approval by the Planning Commission of the planned unit development shall be subject to the procedures and requirements of this section. 
1.  Application for final approval. Following approval of a preliminary planned unit development plan by the Board of Commissioners, the landholder may make application to the Planning Commission for approval of final development plans for all or a portion, (provided the portion is consistent with the staging schedule approved with the preliminary development plan), of the proposed planned unit development. No action shall be taken on any final development plan for any portion of a planned unit development until the landholder demonstrates that all land included within the portion of the development for which final approval is requested is owned by the landholder and that any options have been closed. 
The application for approval of the final development plan shall include all aspects of the preliminary application, the proposed final master development plan, other required drawings, specifications, covenants, easements, and conditions and forms of bond as were set forth by the Planning Commission resolution of preliminary approval. Copies of legal documents required by the Commission for dedication or reservation of common open space and/or for creation of a nonprofit association shall be submitted with the final development plan. 
2.  Final approval of stages. The application for final approval and the final approval by the Planning Commission may be limited to each stage as appropriate in a large planned unit development, in compliance with the staging plan approved as part of the preliminary development plan. 
3.  Final master development plan of a planned unit development. The application for final approval shall be sufficiently detailed to indicate the ultimate operation and appearance of the development, or portion thereof, and shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
a.  A site development plan containing the information required by [sub]section 14-103.3, Site development plans. At a minimum, such plan shall provide the following: 
i.  A grading plan indicating the anticipated finished topography of the area involved (contours shall be shown at vertical intervals no greater than two feet where topography does not exceed ten percent and five feet elsewhere). 
ii.  A circulation diagram indicating the proposed movement of vehicles, goods and pedestrians within the planned unit development and to and from existing thoroughfares. This shall specifically include: width of proposed streets; a plan of any sidewalks or proposed pedestrian ways; and any special engineering features and traffic regulation devices needed to facilitate or ensure the safety of the circulation pattern.

An open space and recreation facilities plan indicating all land and facilities proposed to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved for parks, parkways and other public or semi-public open space uses including any improvements which are to be deeded as part of any common use area. (Such information shall include detailed site designs indicating all intended uses, equipment and facilities along with building or construction plans for the same.) 
iv.  A drainage plan sufficient to meet the requirements of the stormwater management plan adopted by the City. 
v.  A landscaping plan indicating all proposed landscaping and buffers. 
vi.  Information regarding the physical characteristics of the surrounding area and developments within 300 feet of the proposed planned unit development. 
vii.  A plan for each building site showing the approximate location of all lots, buildings, structures and improvements and indicating the open spaces around buildings and structures. Within residential developments, typical building envelopes shall be shown. 
viii.  A plan for proposed utilities including sewers, both sanitary and storm, gas lines, water lines, fire hydrants and electric lines showing proposed connections to existing utility systems. 
ix.  Within nonresidential developments, an off-street parking and loading plan indicating ground coverage of parking areas. 
b.  A detailed land use map and a listing of land uses approved for the development. (Note. For nonresidential sites located within the development, the listing of approved land uses shall include the list of alternative land uses, other than the uses shown on the plan, which were approved within the preliminary planned unit development plan.) 
c.  A tabulation of proposed residential densities to be allocated to various parts of a residential planned unit development. 
d.  Final drafts of all proposed covenants and grants of easement which are proposed for filing with final plats. Such documents shall be in a form approved by legal council. 
e.  Final drafts of all proposed documents establishing a homeowners' association or similar organization created for the purpose of owning and maintaining any common open space or facilities associated therewith. 
f.  A detailed listing of all conditions of approval to which the particular development, or individual sites located therein, are subject. 
If the application is deemed incomplete by the Zoning Administrator, a written request shall be made within ten days after the original submittal, for further information. In such case, the application shall be held in abeyance until deemed complete. No plan shall be formally presented for Planning Commission action until such plan is found complete and ready for review. 
4.  Action on final master development plan. In reviewing a final plan, the function of the reviewing agencies is twofold. First, the plan must be found to be in substantial compliance with the previously approved preliminary development plan. Secondly, all new information must be reviewed to determine its quality and compliance with all substantive requirements of this ordinance. 
a.  Review procedure. 
i.  Application for final approval shall be made to the Planning Commission. 
ii.  The completed final plan must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator ten days prior to the meeting of the Planning Commission where the plan is to be presented. Ten copies of the plan and related documents will be required. 
iii.  Within 30 days subsequent to the formal presentation of the final plan to the Planning Commission it shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to present data and findings of the various departments and agencies of the government concerning the proposed plan to the Planning Commission. 
iv.  The Planning Commission may approve the final plan if it finds: 
(a)  That the final plan meets the provisions for substantial compliance with the preliminary plan set forth in subsection 8-203.5 (below); and 
(b)  That the plan complies with all other standards for review which were not considered when the preliminary plan was approved. 
5.  Approval with modification. Should the Planning Commission require any modification in the final development plan, or any portion thereof, such modifications shall be agreed to by the applicant in writing prior to formal acceptance and filing of the final development plan. 
6.  Filing of an approved final development plan. Upon formal action by the Planning Commission approving a final development plan, or in the instance of conditional final approval, upon acceptance of the modifications as set forth in subpart 5 of this section, said plan and all maps, covenants and other portions thereof, shall be filed with the following: 
a.  The Zoning Administrator. 
b.  The City Recorder. 
7.  Disapproval. If the Planning Commission finds that the final plan does not meet the test for substantial compliance set forth in subsection 8-203.5, or does not comply with other standards of review it shall disapprove the plan. In the event of disapproval, a written report shall be prepared by the Planning Commission and sent to the applicant. This report shall detail the grounds on which the plan was denied to specifically include ways in which the final plan violated the substantial compliance provisions or other standards of review. 
    8-203.5 Determination of substantial compliance. The final development plan shall be deemed in substantial compliance with the preliminary development plan provided modifications by the applicant do not involve changes which in aggregate: 
1.  Violate any provisions of this article; 
2.  Vary the lot area requirement as submitted in the preliminary plan by more than ten percent; 
3.  Involve a reduction of more than five percent of the area shown on the preliminary development plan as reserved for common open space; 
4.  Increase the floor area proposed in the preliminary development plan for nonresidential use by more than two percent; and 
5.  Increase the total ground area covered by buildings by more than two percent; 
6.  Involve any land use not specified on the approved preliminary development plan or the alternative list of uses for nonresidential sites. 
In any instance wherein a final development plan, including minor changes authorized under the provision of subsection 8-203.10, Minor site modifications to an adopted final planned unit development plan, is found not to meet the test of substantial compliance as set forth herein such plan may only be approved upon adoption of appropriate amendments to the adopted plan. 
    8-203.6 Failure to begin planned unit development. If no actual construction has begun in the planned unit development within three years from the date of approval of the final development plan, or section thereof, said approval shall lapse and be of no further effect. No further developmental activity may take place until the existing development plan is reinstated to an active status or a revised development plan meeting all conditions of this ordinance is approved. 
    8-203.7 Maintaining a current development plan. Building permits may be issued only within such portion(s) of a planned unit development for which a current final development plan is in effect. In spite of prior approvals, no action shall be taken in furtherance of any plan for a planned unit development for which a current final development plan is not in effect. In any instance where the approval of such plans may have lapsed due to noncommencement of actual construction, (see subsection 8-203.6) the following actions may be taken: 
1.  Reinstatement of previously approved development plan. In the event that actual construction may not have begun and/or the approval of the final development plan shall have lapsed, such plan may be reinstated by action of the Planning Commission and development may proceed, provided that no change is proposed that would require amendment of the plan. 
2.  Amending a lapsed development plan. In the event that actual construction may not have begun, approval of the development plan shall have lapsed and revisions and/or alterations are proposed that exceed the minor site modifications authorized by subsection 8-203.10, and thus would require amendment of the plan, such action may be accomplished only upon approval of a new preliminary development plan. 
    8-203.8 Enforcement of the development schedule. The construction and provision of all common open spaces and recreational facilities which are shown on the approved preliminary development plan must proceed at no slower rate than construction of dwelling units. From time to time the Planning Commission shall compare the actual development accomplished with the approved development schedule. If the Commission finds that the rate of construction of dwelling units or other commercial or industrial structures is substantially greater than the rate at which common open spaces and recreational facilities have been constructed and provided, then the Planning Commission may take either or both of the following actions: 
1.  Cease to approve any additional final plats; 
2.  Instruct the Zoning Administrator to discontinue issuance of building permits. 
In any instance where the above actions are taken the Planning Commission shall gain assurance that the relationship between the construction of dwellings or other structures of a commercial or industrial nature and the provision of common open spaces and recreational facilities is brought into adequate balance prior to continuance of construction. 
    8-203.9 Building permits and use and occupancy permits. Building permits and use and occupancy permits shall be issued for uses, buildings and other structures in planned unit developments in accordance with this section; otherwise, permits and certificates shall be issued in accordance with the other provisions of this ordinance as applicable. 
1.  Site plans. Site plans shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of article XIV, subsection 14-103.4. (Note. See subsection 14-103.4, for those uses and structures which require site plans.) 
2.  Building permits. Building permits may be issued for structures, buildings, activities, or uses only in strict compliance with the adopted final development plan of the planned unit development, including any conditions of approval. No building permit shall be issued for the area included in a preliminary planned unit development until the final development plan has been approved. 
2.  Use and occupancy permits. A use and occupancy permit may be issued only when the Zoning Administrator determines that the structure, building, activity, or use as a part of a planned unit development conforms with the adopted final development plan, including any conditions of its approval. 
    8-203.10 Minor site modifications to an adopted final planned unit development plan.

    8-203.11 Amendments in an approved final development plan during the period of initial construction. During the period of actual development or construction of any planned unit development, (or when developed in stages of any portion of the total development) the provisions of this section shall apply to all proposed modifications which exceed the minor adjustments permitted by subsection 8-203.10. Once a planned unit development, or portion thereof, has been completed, any further changes or alterations shall be governed by the provisions of subsection 8-203.12. 
All proposed additions of uses not approved in the final master development plan as well as any decreases in the number of parking spaces or vision clearance area shall be subject to these amendatory provisions. In addition all minor modifications which exceed the cumulative changes in the ground coverage ratio, etc., permitted under subsection 8-203.10, shall be governed by the provisions of this section. 
1.  Addition of uses not authorized in the approved development plan, but allowable within the base zoning district. The proposed addition of any use not authorized within an approved preliminary development plan and listing of alternative nonresidential land uses but allowable within the base zoning district wherein such use is proposed, may be added to the plan only when approved as provided, herein. The Planning Commission shall hear all such proposed amendments. In the course of its consideration of any alteration presented hereunder, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing. Said hearing is held for the purpose of making a recommendation to the Board of Commissioners as to disposition of the requested change. The Commission's action on the request for change shall be in the form of a resolution submitted to the Board of Commissioners for amendment to the approved preliminary plan. A report detailing the action recommended by the Planning Commission shall accompany the submission to the Board of Commissioners. All additions of uses not approved in the preliminary development plan must be made by the Board of Commissioners under the procedures authorized by this ordinance for amendment of the zoning map. 
2.  Addition of residential density, floor area of nonresidential uses and all other changes, other than changes in use, not authorized in the approved development plan, but allowable within the base zoning district. All proposed additions other than the additions of uses governed by subpart 1 of this section, including addition of residential density or nonresidential use area which exceed the minor changes permitted under subsection 8-203.10, and were not authorized in the approved preliminary development plan, but are allowable within the base zoning district, shall be considered as provided herein. 
All amendments to an approved development plan proposed under this section shall first be presented to the Planning Commission for a recommendation. In the course of its consideration of any amendment proposed hereunder the Planning Commission may hold a public hearing for all residents and parties who in the judgment of the Planning Commission have an interest in the amendment. 
The Planning Commission shall hear the proposed amendment and shall forward its recommendation to the Board of Commissioners for action. The Board of Commissioners shall hold a public hearing for all residents and other interested parties prior to any final action on any amendment proposed hereunder. Should the Board of Commissioners concur in the proposed amendment to the development plan, the Planning Commission may adopt said amendment only with an amended preliminary plan as a basis for such action. 
    8-203.12 Control of planned unit development following completion. 
1.  Issuance of certificate of completion. Upon completion of a planned unit development, or when developed in stages, of any portion of said development, the Zoning Administrator shall note completion of the final development plan. 
2.  Changes in the use of land or bulk of structures within a planned development after completion. After a planned unit development, or portion thereof, has been certified as complete, the use of land and construction, modification, or alteration of any buildings or structures within the planned development will be governed by the approved final development plan, to the extent that such provisions are applicable. In any instance where a change in the completed development is proposed, the Planning Commission shall review the final development plan and shall provide an evaluation of the proposed change to the agency to whom application for the change has been made. Such evaluation shall as a minimum indicate the Commission's findings concerning consistency of the proposed change with the approved development plan and impact upon the continued successful operation of such development relative to its original purpose and intent. In the course of its consideration of any change proposed hereunder the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing for all residents and parties who in its judgment have an interest in the proposed amendment. No changes may be made in the final development plan, unless required for the continued successful functioning of the planned development or unless such are required by changes in conditions that have occurred since the final plan was adopted or by changes in the development policy of the community. Changes may be made in the approved final development plan only upon application to the appropriate agency under the following procedure: 
a.  Any minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be authorized by the Planning Commission if such extensions, alterations or modifications are determined to be consistent with the purposes and intent of the recorded final development plan. 
b.  Any uses not authorized by the approved final development plan, but allowable as a permitted use, a use permitted with supplemental provisions or a conditional use in the base zoning district within which the applicable portion of the planned development is located, may be added to the recorded final development plan under the procedures provided by this ordinance for the approval of conditional uses. (See subpart 5 of subsection 8-201.1, Jurisdiction of Planning Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals.) 
c.  Unless an amendment to the final development plan is approved as set forth below, a building or structure that is totally or substantially destroyed may be reconstructed only in compliance with the final development plan. 
d.  Provided that no amendment approved hereunder may act to abrogate or annul any covenant which provides for the use, operation or continuance of the common open space, changes in the use of common open space may be authorized by an amendment to the final development plan. 
e.  All other changes in the final development plan must be made by the Board of Commissioners, under the procedures authorized by this ordinance for amendment of the zoning map. 
f.  No changes in the final development plan which are approved under this section are to be considered as a waiver of the covenants limiting use of land, buildings, structures and improvements within the area of the planned development, and all rights to enforce these covenants against any changes permitted by this section are expressly reserved. 
3.  Resubdivision of a planned unit development after completion. A planned unit development may be subdivided and resubdivided for purpose of sale or lease after the certificate of completion has been issued under the procedures set forth below: 
a.  If the subdivision or resubdivision of planned development will create a new plot line, the applicant shall make application to the Planning Commission for approval of a subdivision or resubdivision. The Planning Commission may approve the subdivision or resubdivision of each section of the subdivided or resubdivided planned development if it meets the provisions of this article governing density, common open space and dimensional requirements. 
b.  All sections of a subdivided or resubdivided planned development are to be controlled by the final development plan rather than by the provisions of the zoning ordinance that otherwise would be applicable. 
c.  The owners or lessees of a subdivided or resubdivided planned development may jointly make application for a conditional use or for an amendment to the adopted final development plan. 
(Ord. No. 2002-23, 8-12-2002; Ord. No. 2007-32, 8-13-2007; Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 8-203; Ord. No. 2012-35, § 1, 6-11-2012) 
Sec. 8-204. - Common open space. 
    Any common open space established by an adopted final master development plan for a planned unit development shall be subject to the following: 
8-204.1 Quality, use and improvement of common open space. 
1.  Common open space shall be used for amenity, site protection or recreational purposes. The uses authorized for common open space shall be appropriate to the scale and character of the planned unit development considering its size, developmental density, expected population, topography and other factors. 
2.  No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the approved final development plan, unless such plan has been amended by action of the Board of Commissioners upon recommendation of the Planning Commission to specifically allow the change of use. No matter how authorized, no change may be considered as a waiver of any of the covenants limiting the use of common open space areas, and all rights to enforce these covenants against any use so permitted are expressly reserved. 
3.  Common open space may, subject to approval by the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners, consist of improved or unimproved land. All such land shall be designated as to its intended use upon the final development plan, all site plans and all plats. 
4.  The final development plan shall indicate the intended use of all common open space located within the development. In the case of improved recreational space, such plan shall indicate in detail the design of such spaces along with a listing of all recreation facilities and equipment proposed for location within these spaces. 
8-204.2 Assurance involving the provision of common open space. The Planning Commission shall require adequate assurance, in a form and manner that it approves, that the common open space shown on the final development plan will be provided and developed. The following methods of assurance are illustrative of the types of assurances required. They may be used singly, in combination or in conjunction with other similar methods: 
1.  The City may accept a letter of credit, corporate surety, or other acceptable financial guarantee in an amount sufficient to purchase the common open space shown on the approved development plan or final plat. This surety is to be presented with the final subdivision plat for the lots served by the open space. 
2.  The title to the land shown as common open space may be put in escrow. The escrow agreement shall provide that the land is to be held in escrow until the Planning Commission has certified to the escrow agent that the planned development has been completed, at which time the common open space is to be conveyed as provided in this section. The escrow agreement may provide for release of common open space by the escrow agent in stages. In such instance, the Planning Commission is to certify completion of each stage of the planned unit development to the escrow agent and the escrow agreement must provide that the open space may be conveyed in stages. 
3.  In general, the construction and provision of all common open spaces and public and recreational facilities shown on the master development plan must proceed at no slower rate than the construction of dwelling units. From time to time, the Planning Commission shall compare the actual development with the development schedule. If the Commission finds that the rate of construction of dwelling units or commercial structures is substantially greater than the rate at which common open spaces and public recreational facilities have been constructed and provided, then the Planning Commission may either cease to approve additional final plats and/or instruct the Zoning Administrator to discontinue issuance of building permits. 
8-204.3 Conveyance of common open space. All land and improvements shown on final development plan as common open space shall be conveyed according to a schedule and in the manner set forth herein. 
1.  Schedule for conveyance. A schedule for conveyance of all common open space shall accompany and be an integral part of any preliminary development plan approved under authority of this ordinance. Such plan shall as a minimum provide the following information: 
a.  A listing and description of all real property and any facilities located thereon that is to be conveyed; 
b.  A detailed schedule for development of the open space land and construction of the facilities; 
(Note. This schedule shall be directly linked to the proposed schedule for development of the project as a whole. The schedule shall reference the various phases and sub-phases of the project in such a manner as to clearly indicate when in the overall development of such project all open space land and improvements are to be constructed.) 
c.  A detailed schedule for conveyance of the open space land and improvements; and 
(Note. This schedule shall reference the various phases and sub-phases of the project in such a manner as to clearly indicate when in the overall development of such project all open space land and improvements are to be conveyed. The schedule shall further indicate any improvements that are to be added to open space lands following conveyance.) 
d.  Where any land within an approved PUD, Planned Unit Development District is proposed to be subdivided into residential lots and such site contains improved recreational open space (see definition) the recreational open space and all improvements shall be completed and conveyed either at the time of filing of the final plat or at the time streets and other improvements located within such development are offered for public dedication or acceptance by a maintenance organization created pursuant to subsection 8-204.4. 
2.  Methods of ownership and conveyance. Common open space within a development shall be owned, administered and maintained by the City or some form of owner's organization created pursuant to the provisions set forth herein. The following methods, either individually or in combination, may, subject to approval by the City, be utilized as vehicles of ownership and control of open space: 
a.  Dedication to government agency. The City shall have the first and last offer of dedication of open space. Dedication shall take the form of a fee simple ownership. The City may, but shall not be required to accept open space provided: 
i.  Such land is accessible to the residents of the City; 
ii.  There is no cost of acquisition other than the costs incidental to the transfer of ownership, such as title insurance; and 
iii.  The City agrees to and has access to maintain such lands. 
Where the City accepts dedication of common open space that contains improvements, the City may require the posting of financial security to ensure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements. Such surety shall run for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication and the amount shall not exceed 15 percent of the actual cost of said improvements. 
b.  Homeowners' association. Open space may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture establishing an association, funded trust, or similar organization meeting the requirements of subsection 8-204.4, below, for the maintenance of the common open space within the planned development. The common open space shall be conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants to be approved by the Planning Commission. Such covenants shall provide for maintenance of the common open space in a manner that ensures its continuing use for its intended purposes specified on the final development plan. 
c.  Condominiums. The common open space and improvements may be controlled through use of condominium agreements, approved by the City. Such agreements shall be in conformance with the State's Horizontal Property Act. All open space land within such developments shall be held as a common element. 
d.  Dedication of easements. The City may, but shall not be required to, accept easements for public use of any portion or portions of undeveloped open space land, title of which is to remain in ownership by a condominium or homeowners' association, provided: 
i.  Such land is accessible to City residents;

8-204.5 Maintenance of common open space. 
1.  The ultimate owner of the open space (typically a homeowners' association) shall be responsible for raising all monies required for operations, maintenance, or physical improvements to the open space through annual dues, special assessments, etc. The homeowners' association shall be authorized under its bylaws to place liens on the property of residents who fall delinquent in payment of such dues, assessments, etc. 
2.  In the event that the association or any successor organization shall at any time fail to maintain the undivided open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the adopted master development plan, the City may serve written notice upon the owner of record, setting forth the manner in which the owner has failed to maintain the undivided open space in reasonable condition. 
8-204.6 Failure of maintenance organization. Failure to adequately maintain the common open space in reasonable order and condition constitutes a violation of this ordinance. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain common open space, or any successor organization shall at any time after establishment of the planned unit development fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the adopted master development plan, the Zoning Administrator may serve written notice upon such organization and/or the owners or residents of the planned unit development and hold a public hearing. After 30 days when deficiencies of maintenance are not corrected, the Zoning Administrator shall call upon any public or private agency to maintain the common open space for a period of one year. When the Zoning Administrator determines that the original organization does not have the capability to continue maintenance of common open space, the agency appointed under the provisions of this section may continue maintenance for yearly periods. The cost of such maintenance shall be assessed proportionately against the properties within the planned unit development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a special assessment to the property tax or a lien on said properties.

Sec. 8-205. - Minimum performance standards. 
    In addition to satisfying all other applicable provisions of this ordinance, approval of a master development plan shall be based upon a demonstration that the following design and development objectives have been satisfied: 
8-205.1 Protection of environmentally sensitive areas. Approval of a master development plan for any PUD district shall be based upon a demonstration that the proposed development plan will result in greater protection and preservation of environmentally sensitive areas than would otherwise result under provisions of the base zoning district. Areas to be protected shall fully comply with all provisions of article XII, pertaining to protection of areas with steep slopes, designated wetlands and floodplain areas along streams, major drains and sinkholes. 
8-205.2 Adequate streets, utilities and drainage. Approval of a master development plan for any PUD district shall be based upon a demonstration that streets, utilities and drainage features will be of adequate capacity to serve the proposed development. As a part of a master development plan proposal, a property owner may offer to improve or otherwise provide adequate facilities to support the proposed intensity of development. Public facilities already included in an adopted capital improvements budget may be considered a demonstration of adequate capacity if the proposed funding is timed with anticipated construction of the development. 
8-205.3 Coordinated vehicular access. Approval of a master development plan for any PUD district shall be based upon a demonstration that the internal traffic circulation system will be adequate to support the operational needs of the development itself in a manner that maintains the integrity and operational capacity of the community's major street network to standards equal to or greater than levels of operation existing at the time such development is approved. 
8-205.4 Preservation of historic and/or archaeological sites. All reasonable measures shall be taken to incorporate features of historic or archaeological significance into the design of any PUD district in a manner which contributes to the protection and preservation of those features. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 8-205)

In a case of conflict between the provisions of this article and any other provision of this ordinance, the provisions of this article shall apply within PUD districts. 
8-206.2 Landscaping and buffering. Within any planned unit development, landscaping and buffering shall be provided which meets or exceeds the purposes and intents for such established in article X. It is intended, however, that within PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts, alternative means may be employed to achieve an equal level of protection to that resulting from strict application of the provisions of article X. This provision is intended to permit and encourage use of flexible techniques to achieve a transitional character through site design that minimizes the harmful impact of noise, dust and other debris, motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusion, and other objectionable activities or impacts conducted on or created by an adjoining or nearby use. 
8-206.3 Parking, loading and access. All planned unit developments shall be subject to the provisions of article IX, Parking, loading and access, provided that the Planning Commission may permit a variance from off-street parking and loading requirements in approving a final development plan. 
8-206.4 Neighborhood relationship. A planned unit development shall be harmonious and not conflict with surrounding residential neighborhoods. It shall be planned, designed and constructed so as to avoid undue traffic congestion in the surrounding residential area and provide a satisfactory relationship of land use with the surrounding residential area, making use of landscaping, screening, open space and placement of buildings where required by accepted land planning principles. 
8-206.5 Architectural compatibility. Architectural features deemed essential to ensure compatibility with surrounding properties shall be incorporated. Architectural compatibility should be limited to those portions of the development which abut adjacent properties or can be seen from the frontage street. Examples of architectural features which may be important for ensuring compatibility include building bulk, height, roof slopes, building orientation, overhangs, porches and exterior materials. 
8-206.6 Permitted land uses. Land uses permitted within any PUD district shall be established based upon the underlying zoning district(s). Any land use classified as a (P) or (SUP) by the land use tables applicable to the underlying district may be permitted within a corresponding PUD district. Any land use classified as a conditional (C) use may be permitted within a PUD district if approved initially as a part of a master development plan, or, upon completion of the development, by the Board of Zoning Appeals (See subpart 5, Jurisdiction of Planning Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals, of subsection 8-201.1) based upon a favorable recommendation by the Planning Commission. 
8-206.7 Preservation of natural features. Mature trees, vegetative cover, watercourses, stone walls, existing relief and other natural site features shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible. Abrupt changes in natural slope shall be avoided. Preservation shall be directed toward: 
1.  Enhancing the quality of new development; 
2.  Protecting the natural environment; 
3.  Providing buffering between new development and surrounding properties; and 
4.  Preserving the existing neighborhood character. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 8-206)

Sec. 8-208. - Nonresidential development standards. 
    8-208.1 Uses permitted. 
1.  General[ly]. In general, the uses and activities permitted within the underlying base commercial or mixed-use zoning district may be permitted within commercial planned unit developments (CPUD) which overlay those districts. Provided, however, that such uses may be further restricted as provided in subpart 2 of this section, below. 
2.  Findings of appropriateness. Due to the unique ability of the planned unit development process to tailor individual developments so as to achieve balanced and reasonable use of the land while maintaining an assured measure of protection for surrounding owners, it is necessary that limited discretion be afforded the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners in the process of selecting uses within particular developments. In this regard, it is necessary that the uses permitted within a particular development establish and maintain a high degree of compatibility with the immediately surrounding area. To this end, the selection of uses permitted within each individual commercial planned unit development will be guided by: 
a.  The use provisions established for the base district which the commercial planned unit development overlays. 
b.  The appropriateness of each use given the intended function of each type commercial planned unit development. 
c.  The unique nature of the property surrounding each development. 
d.  Consistency with any adopted area development plan which may be applicable to the proposed site. 
This process may result in limitations, restrictions or the prohibition of particular uses permitted within a base zoning district from a commercial planned unit development which overlays that district. 
    8-208.2 Location and required area of commercial planned unit development. 
1.  Review of adopted long-range general plan required. In no event shall the location, composition, and extent of a proposed commercial planned unit development be approved unless such development is consistent with the actions and policies regarding land development adopted by the Planning Commission. 
2.  Market analysis for commercial planned unit development. The Planning Commission may require a market analysis for any proposed commercial planned unit development. The market analysis will be utilized, among other things, to determine the impact of the proposed development on the long-range development of the commercial land use in the area, to determine the timing of any proposed development, to limit the extent of convenience districts serving a particular residential area; to ascertain the effects of a proposed development upon lands used or zoned for commercial purposes; to form a basis for evaluating the estimated effects on traffic, and other purposes which assist in an understanding of the public interest pertinent in the evaluation of a proposed development. The market analysis, if required, shall be provided by the landholder and the landholder shall provide any other economic data or analysis as may be reasonably requested by the Planning Commission or Board of Commissioners. 
    8-208.3 Bulk, height and building spacing requirements. 
1.  Building coverage ratio. Individual buildings located within a commercial PUD, Planned Unit Development District may exceed the maximum lot coverage ratio established for the base zoning district wherein the commercial planned unit development is located. However, in no instance shall the aggregate site coverage of all buildings located within the commercial PUD, Planned Unit Development District exceed the coverage provisions established for the base zoning district in which such site is located. Building coverage ratios shall be calculated on a pro rata basis when more than one underlying base zoning district exists within a commercial planned unit development. If land uses are proposed to be redistributed across the boundaries of underlying zoning districts, maximum floor areas shall be assigned to each component of the master development plan and recorded by plat or equivalent instrument with the first phase of the final master development plan. 
2.  Maximum building height. The building height provisions established for the base zoning wherein the commercial planned unit development is located shall apply to all buildings. 
3.  Building spacing and yards. 
a.  Provisions applicable along residential district boundaries. Along all portions of a district boundary where a commercial planned unit development adjoins residentially zoned land not included within the PUD district, all nonresidential buildings shall be located a minimum of 60 feet measured from the site boundary to the nearest building line. 
b.  Provisions applicable along all other district boundaries. Unless, otherwise, specified in the approved master development plan for the commercial planned unit development, all development located along district boundaries shall provide minimum yards and building separations specified for the base zoning district. Within the commercial PUD, Planned Unit Development District, such yards shall be landscaped and maintained in a manner appropriate to a residential neighborhood for a distance of ten feet from the lot line adjacent to any street. No such required landscaped area shall be used for off-street parking, loading or storage of any kind. No landscaping adjacent to a street shall be located where it impairs visibility of or from approaching traffic, or creates potential hazards for pedestrians. Where the site plan indicates potential adverse effects (such as automobile lights) of parking or other characteristics of a commercial activity, a wall, fence, or appropriate vegetative screening shall be required to be erected and maintained in such manner as to eliminate such effects or reduce them to an acceptable level. If there is to be parking on the premises after dark, such buffering shall at a minimum prevent lights from automobiles parked or maneuvering incidental to parking from shining across adjacent residential property below a height of five feet. 
c.  Provisions applicable to internal portions of a commercial PUD, Planned Unit Development District. Except as provided in subparts a. and b. of this [sub]section, the minimum yard requirements of the base district shall be waived within commercial PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts. Minimum building separation shall be as provided herein. Along all sides of buildings where vehicular access is from a public street buildings shall be set back a minimum of 60 feet. In cases where a building wall is not located directly adjacent to an interior side or rear lot line that is not adjacent to an alley, a yard with a minimum width or depth from the lot line of 15 feet or the distance required by applicable building and fire codes shall be provided. Permitted obstructions within such yards shall be limited to those listed in article VI, subsection 6-103.4, subpart 1. 
4.  Outdoor storage or sales activities. Unless, otherwise, specified in the approved master development plan for the commercial planned unit development, all outdoor storage facilities and outdoor sales activities are prohibited in any commercial PUD, Planned Unit Development District. This provision shall not be construed to exclude seasonal displays, short-term charitable events of no more than 90 days duration, the outdoor display of new or used automotive vehicles or trailers for sale or rent, or the incidental display of goods or chattels for sale or rent in a commercial PUD, Planned Unit Development District, by an establishment having activities that occur principally within a building. 
5.  Lighting provisions. No direct source of illumination which may be located in a commercial planned unit development shall be visible beyond the boundary of such development. No illumination of any kind shall exceed one footcandle power at or beyond the boundary of such development and shall not flash or blink, or appear to flash or blink, or shall be animated or appear to be animated. 
6.  Landscaping provisions. The provisions of subsection 8-206.2, Landscaping and buffering, shall apply fully within all commercial PUD, Planned Unit Development Districts. In particular, off-street parking areas, service areas for loading and unloading other than passenger vehicles, and areas for storage and collection of refuse and garbage shall be screened.

Sec. 8-301. - Floodplain district regulations. 
    8-301.1 Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Tennessee has in sections 13-7-201 through 13-7-210, Tennessee Code Annotated, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mt. Juliet, Tennessee Board of Commissioners, does ordain as follows: 
    8-301.2 Findings of fact. 
1.  The Mt. Juliet, Tennessee Board of Commissioners, wishes to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and in order to do so must meet the requirements of 60.3 of the Federal Insurance Administration Regulations found at 44 CFR ch. 1 (10-1-2004 edition). 
2.  Areas of Mt. Juliet are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
3.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
    8-301.3 Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This ordinance is designed to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers involved in the accommodation floodwaters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    8-301.4 Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are: 
1.  To protect human life, health and property; 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects; 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodable areas; 
6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize blight in flood areas; 
7.  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodable area; and 
8.  To maintain eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been pre-identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.

Sec. 8-303. - General provisions. 
    8-303.1 Application. This ordinance shall apply to all areas within the incorporated area of Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. 
    8-303.2 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified on the Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, Federal Emergency Management Agency, flood insurance study (FIS) and flood insurance rate map (FIRM), community panel Nos. 470290, 0019, 0127, 0129, 0131, 0132, 0133, 0134, 0140, 0142, 0145, 0151, 0153, 0161 and 0162, dated, May 18, 2009, along with all supporting technical data, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. 
    8-303.3 Land subject to flood. In applying the provisions of this section, land subject to flood shall be defined as follows: 
1.  Along all streams and watercourses identified as having special flood hazards by the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA) appearing on the maps cited in [sub]section 8-303.2, above. 
2.  Along other small streams and watercourses. The lands lying within 100 feet of the top of the bank of the channel measured horizontally, unless the developer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that the property in question is free from the danger of flooding, or that adequate measures have been taken to allow the watercourse to safety accommodate floodwaters. The developer shall submit such data or studies based on the watershed characteristics, probable runoff and other topographic and hydraulic data prepared by a registered professional engineer as the Planning Commission may reasonably require to make its determination of the flood susceptibility of the property. 
3.  Along sinkholes and other low places. All lands lying below the elevation of the lowest point in the watershed boundary, unless a study prepared by a registered professional engineer demonstrates that a lower elevation would be safe from the danger of inundation by the 100-year flood. 
    8-303.4 Requirement for development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformity with this ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
    8-303.5 Compliance. No land, structure or use shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. 
    8-303.6 Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance conflicts or overlaps with another regulatory instrument, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
    8-303.7 Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under Tennessee statutes. 
    8-303.8 Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Mt. Juliet, Tennessee or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
    8-303.9 Application of the district. To enable the district to operate in harmony with the plan for land use and population density embodied in this ordinance, the F-1, Floodplain District is created as a special district to be superimposed on other districts contained in these regulations and is to be so designated by a special symbol for its boundaries on the zoning map. Except where in conflict with the specific requirements of the F-1, Floodplain District, permitted uses, accessory uses, minimum lot requirements, minimum yard requirements, maximum height and requirements for off-street parking and loading shall be determined by the requirements of the basic district regulations contained elsewhere in this ordinance. 
    8-303.10 Proposal for stream channel alteration. When a developer proposes to offset the effects of a development in the floodway or on the flood carrying capacity of any stream by the construction of channel improvements, he shall submit to the Planning Commission an engineering study which fully evaluates the effects of such development. The study shall use the 100-year flood, as herein defined, and the equal degree of encroachment rule as the basis of all such analysis. All adjacent communities and the State of Tennessee, Local Planning Assistance Office, shall be notified by the developer via certified mail of all such intended activities prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. In addition, the developer shall ensure the City of Mt. Juliet, in writing, that the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse will be maintained such that its flow capacity is not diminished by debris accumulation, silt deposition, or vegetative growth. 
    8-303.11 Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the [City of] Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, from taking such other lawful actions to prevent or remedy any violation.

Specifically, the following information is required: 
1.  Application stage. 
a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor, including basement, of all buildings where base flood elevations (BFEs) are available, or to the highest adjacent grade when applicable under this ordinance. (See subpart 2, below.) 
b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential building will be floodproofed where BFE's are available, or to the highest adjacent grade when applicable under this ordinance. (See subpart 2, below.) 
c.  Design certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the proposed nonresidential floodproofed building will meet the floodproofing criteria in [sub]section 8-304.2. (See subpart 2, below.) 
d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
2.  Construction stage. Within unnumbered A zones, where flood elevation data are not available, the Zoning Administrator shall record the elevation of the lowest floor on the development permit. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be determined as the measurement of the lowest floor of the building relative to the highest adjacent grade. USGS Quadrangle maps may be utilized when no more detailed reference exists to establish reference elevations. 
For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the Zoning Administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or floodproofing level upon the completion of the lowest floor or floodproofing. Within unnumbered A zones, where flood elevation data is not available, the elevation of the lowest floor shall be determined as the measurement of the lowest floor of the building relative to the highest adjacent grade. 
Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of, a registered land surveyor and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for a nonresidential building, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of, a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The Zoning Administrator shall review the above-referenced certification data. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project. 
    8-304.3 Duties and responsibilities of the Zoning Administrator. Duties of the Zoning Administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Review of all development permits to ensure that the permit requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied, and that proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
2.  Advice to permittee that additional federal or state permits may be required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements are known, require that copies of such, permits be provided and maintained on file with the development permit. This shall include section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334. 
3.  Notification to adjacent communities and the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, Local Planning Assistance Office, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submission of evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
4.  For any altered or relocated watercourse, submit engineering data/analysis within six months to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure accuracy of community flood maps through the letter of map revision process. Ensure that the flood carrying capacity within an altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
5.  Record the elevation, in relation to mean sea level or the highest adjacent grade, where applicable of the lowest floor including basement of all new or substantially improved buildings, in accordance with [sub]section 8-304.2. 
6.  Record the actual elevation; in relation to mean sea level or the highest adjacent grade, where applicable to which the new or substantially improved buildings have been floodproofed, in accordance with [sub]section 8-304.2. 
7.  When floodproofing is utilized for a structure, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain certification of design criteria from a registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with [sub]section 8-304.2. 
8.  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this ordinance. 
9.  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency then the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements or other development in zone A, on the City's FHBM or FIRM maps meet the requirements of this ordinance. 
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not been established and where alternative data is not available, the Zoning Administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in section 8-302). All applicable data including elevations or floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in [sub]section 8-304.2. 
10.  All records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance shall be maintained in the office of the Zoning Administrator and shall be open for public inspection. Permits issued under the provisions of this ordinance shall be maintained in a separate file or marked for expedited retrieval within combined files.

All applicable data including elevations or floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in [sub]section 8-304.2. Buildings located in all A zones may be floodproofed, in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and are built with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the Zoning Administrator as set forth in [sub]section 8-304.2. 
3.  Elevated building. All new construction or substantial improvements to existing buildings that include any fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation, or required height above the highest adjacent grade, shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
(1)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
(2)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the finish grade; and 
(3)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
b.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the elevated living area (stairway or elevator); and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms in such a way as to impede the movement of floodwaters and all such petitions shall comply with the provisions of [sub]section 8-305.2 of this ordinance. 
4.  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on: 
(1)  Individual lots or parcels; 
(2)  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
(3)  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements of new construction, including elevations and anchoring. 
b.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that either: 
(1)  When base flood elevations are available the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated on a permanent foundation no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
(2)  Absent base flood elevations the manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements) at least three feet in height above the highest adjacent grade. 
c.  Any manufactured home, which has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood or that has substantially improved, must meet the standards of [sub]section 8-305.2. 
d.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
e.  All recreational vehicles placed on identified flood hazard sites must either: 
(1)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
(2)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached structures or additions; 
(3)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of this section above if on the site for longer than 180 consecutive days. 
5.  Standards for subdivisions. Subdivisions and other proposed new developments, including manufactured home parks, shall be reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a floodprone area, any such proposals shall be reviewed to ensure that: 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
d.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that are greater than 50 lots and/or five acres in area. 
    8-305.3 Standards for areas of special flood hazard with established base flood elevations and with floodways designated. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in [sub]section 8-303.2, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new construction, substantial improvements or other developments within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted; provided, however, it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or new development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not result in any increase [of] the water surface elevation of the base flood level, velocities or floodway widths during the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
2.  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 8-305. 
    8-305.4 Standards for areas of special flood hazard zones A1-30 and ae with established base flood elevations but without floodways designated. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in [sub]section 8-303.2, where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been designated (zones A1-30 and AE), the following provisions apply: 
1.  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
2.  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with [sub]section 8-305.2. 
    8-305.5 Standards for streams without established base flood elevations or floodways (A zones) and sinkholes. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in [sub]section 8-303.2, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided (A zones), or where a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 8-303, then the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of section 8-305, only if data is not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2 and 3) shall apply: 
2.  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principle. 
3.  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction or substantial improvements of existing [buildings] shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of [sub]section 8-305.2 and elevated buildings. 
    8-305.6 Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in [sub]section 8-303.2, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one foot above the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of [sub]section 8-305.2 and elevated buildings. 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at least one foot above the specified FIRM flood level, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be floodproofed to at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide such certification to the Zoning Administrator as set forth above and as required in [sub]section 8-304.2. 
3.  Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
4.  The Zoning Administrator shall certify the elevation or the highest adjacent grade, where applicable, and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
    8-305.7 Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99 zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-303, are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but where base flood elevations and flood hazard factors have not been determined. Within these areas (A-99 zones) all provisions of section 8-304 and [sub]section 8-305.1, shall apply. 
    8-305.8 Standards for unmapped streams. Located within Mt. Juliet, Tennessee are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no encroachments including fill material or structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the locality. 
2.  When new elevation data is available, new construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 8-304. 
3.  Within any identified sinkholes, the following shall apply: 
a.  All new residential building shall be elevated at least one foot above the lowest point within the rim of the sinkhole and all nonresidential buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above that elevation, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or new development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation, assuming conditions of the base flood discharge and only normal ground absorption within the sinkhole, to the rim of the sinkhole. 
b.  In no event, however, shall any residential building be located lower than or any nonresidential building be located or floodproofed to any elevation lower than one foot above the elevation of the 100-year flood.

Sec. 8-306. - Variance procedures. 
    The provisions of this section shall apply exclusively to areas of special flood hazard within Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. 
8-306.1 Board of Zoning Appeals. 
1.  The Mt. Juliet Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
3.  In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and: 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other property to the injury of others; 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
g.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
h.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; and 
i.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
4.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this ordinance. 
5.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
8-306.2 Conditions for variances. 
1.

Sec. 8-501. - Village Commercial District Overlay. 
    8-501.1. Intent. It is the intent of the Village Commercial District Overlay to encourage the redevelopment of the original commercial areas of the City that were substantially developed prior to 1972. The CTC commercial zoning allows a wide variety of uses, including retail, professional office, service oriented business, residential and/or combinations of the above uses; the Village Commercial District Overlay encourages a more compact arrangement and a pedestrian-oriented approach for development activity. Within the Village Commercial District Overlay (VCDO) as shown on the zoning map of the City, the regulations set out in this section shall apply. 
    8-501.2. Purpose. Due to smaller, narrower properties within the VCDO and the existing architectural character of the quaint, yet functional smaller retail buildings similar to the original historic Mt. Juliet, it is envisioned that the future character of the VCDO will reinforce and respect these desirable characteristics by incorporating residential architectural features (i.e., pitched roofs, porches). 
    8-501.3. Application of the district. 
a.  General[ly]. The provisions of the VCDO are mandatory and shall be applied to all real property located within the area designated as sub-district A: Village Commercial Sub-District in the map specified in illustration 8-500A which are zoned Commercial Town Center (CTC). 
b.  Relation of CTC [and] VCDO to other regulations. The VCDO regulations that follow shall apply to all CTC zoned property in designated area. Where there are conflicts between these regulations and general; zoning, subdivision, or other regulations, the provisions of the VCDO shall prevail. 
c.  Implementation. The responsibility and jurisdiction for the implementation of and approvals for the VCDO shall be with the Mt. Juliet Regional Planning Commission. 
    8-501.4 VCDO technical standards. For all new development or redevelopment within the VCDO district, the following technical standards shall apply: 
1.  Standard width of building at designated frontage should occupy at least 25 percent of the setback line along the front of the property, to a maximum of 150 feet.

2.  Setback line shall be a minimum of 30 feet and a maximum of 50 feet behind the public sidewalk area located in the right-of-way. Any new or renovated building shall maintain, to the greatest extent feasible, a transitional front build-to-line consistent with all storefronts or buildings previously approved or constructed under these standards and located within the same street block. 
3.  Minimum required side setback yard, 20 feet (intended for use as a public utility and drainage easement.) 
4.  Minimum required rear setback yard, ten feet. Side yards between adjoining buildings shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible.

6.  Vehicle access control. The location and design of all driveways and accesses that allow vehicles to enter public streets from any lot developed in this zoning district shall comply with vehicle access control regulations set forth in article IX of this ordinance; however, in recognition of a more compact arrangement of mixed-use development in the district, the Planning Commission may grant exceptions to the technical standards related to minimum distance of driveways from intersection and property lines and minimum radius of driveway curves. The use of shared driveways and rear service lanes to access public streets shall be encouraged to the greatest extent feasible and practical. Service entrances and overhead doors shall not be permitted to face or access a public street directly. 
7.  Erosion control and stormwater management. The control of erosion during development and the design of drainage systems suitable to handle the additional stormwater runoff after the site is developed shall comply with the requirements of article XII of this ordinance and the subdivision regulations of the City.

    8-501.6 Design standards. For all new development or redevelopment within the VCDO district, the following design standards shall apply: 
1.  Height variation. All buildings should be similar in height to the greatest extent feasible. The Planning Commission may require the upper stories of a building that will be taller than the average building height on a block to be recessed further back from the front build-to-line. The above height limitations and restrictions do not prohibit the use of an architectural feature such as a tower, cupola, etc., located above the roofline, provided the feature is in character with the architecture of the building and area; the total height of the building and feature does not exceed two stories, plus mechanical/elevator penthouse; and the feature is not designed or used for placement of elevated wall signs. 
2.  Scale/massing. Individual buildings should use human-scaled/pedestrian oriented architectural features. Individual building should clearly articulate the first story and primary entrances, with display windows encouraged for retail stores. The ground floor should be clearly delineated from the upper stories and the upper floors from the top of the front facade roofline. Large blank walls greater then 25 feet in length and large monolithic box-like structures shall be avoided. Larger buildings should be designed to divide the mass of the facility to create a visual impression of a series of smaller building or sections. Windows, doors, shutters, columns, masonry detailing and variations in the roofline, building wall recesses and variations in colors and materials should be used in areas of over 25 feet in length to break up the mass of a single building. 
3.  Exterior materials and details. High quality materials which are durable and attractive shall be used on all buildings. The building shall have an exterior facade (excluding windows, trim and doors) covered in wood, brick, cast stone, cultured stone or an alternative masonry material acceptable to the Planning Commission. Wood accents shall be used for brick and wood construction. Use of vinyl or aluminum siding is prohibited. 
4.  Roofing. All new buildings shall have a pitched roof with a minimum pitch ratio of 4:12 (four inch[es of rise] for every 12 inches of length). 
5.  Window/door openings. Each floor facing a public street shall have windows covering a minimum of 20 percent and a maximum of 40 percent of the wall area. Buildings should have clearly defined and highly visible customer entrances, which should be recessed or framed by a sheltering element such as an overhang, canopy, awning or other roof form. Individual framed windows and doors should be residential in style, instead of continuous horizontal "ribbon or band" type. Reflective glass, overly tinted glass and glass curtain walls and other continuous, floor-to-ceiling windows shall be avoided. The patterns of window openings and details of bays should be used to create a sense of scale and add visual interest to building facades. Wall openings should not span vertically more than one story. 
6.  Awnings. The design of awnings, including the selection of material and color, should complement the architectural style and character of the building. Canvas awnings are preferable. The use of plastic, metal and aluminum awnings should be avoided.

Sec. 9-101. - Purposes and applicability. 
    9-101.1 Purposes. The following regulations on accessory off-street parking spaces are adopted in order to provide needed spaces off the streets for parking in connection with all activities which may be located in the City to reduce traffic congestion resulting from use of the streets as places of storage for automobiles, to protect the character of neighborhoods, to provide for a higher standard of development within the area and thus promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
    9-101.2 Applicability. 
1.  General[ly]. For every use, activity, or structure permitted by this ordinance and for all buildings or structures erected in accordance therewith, there shall be provided sufficient space for access and off-street standing, parking, circulation, unloading and loading of motor vehicles that may be expected to transport its occupants, whether as patrons, residents, customers, employees, guests, or otherwise, to an establishment, activity, or place of residence at any time under normal conditions for any purpose. When a use is expanded, accessory off-street parking and loading shall be provided in accordance with the regulations herein for the area or capacity of such expansion in combination with the previously existing uses, structure, or activity. 
2.  New and complying development. New development occurring after the effective date of this ordinance and development existing on the effective date of this ordinance and complying with the number of off-street parking spaces required by this article shall be subject to the following provisions: 
a.  Every use of a building or land hereafter established shall provide the minimum off-street parking and loading spaces as required by this article. 
b.  The number of parking and loading spaces required by this article may be reduced when the land use or floor area of a building is changed or reduced to a use or floor area for which fewer parking or loading spaces are required. 
c.  When a building is expanded or a land use is changed so as to increase the number of spaces required, the number of such spaces shall be increased. 
3.  Existing noncomplying development. Developments with legally noncomplying parking and loading areas shall be subject to the following provisions: 
a.  No reduction below requirements. Existing parking and loading spaces shall not be reduced below the minimum required by this article. 
b.  Redevelopment not increasing parking requirements. Zoning permits and certifications of zoning compliance may be issued for a change of use or remodeling or structural alterations in developments containing legally noncomplying parking and loading areas, without requiring compliance with this article, provided that such redevelopment does not result in an increase in the number of required parking or loading spaces. 
c.  Redevelopment increasing parking requirements. Developments with legally noncomplying parking and loading areas shall be subject to the following provisions: 
i.  Minor change. Any building expansion or change of use that results in an increase of 25 percent or less over the number of parking spaces that would be required under this article for the lot prior to the redevelopment activity shall be required to provide only the additional parking or loading spaces in excess of the number that would be required under this article for the previous development. Only the expanded portion of the parking or loading area shall be required to comply with the provisions of this article. 
ii.  Major change. Any building expansion or change of use that results in an increase of more than 25 percent over the number of parking spaces that would be required under this article for the lot prior to the redevelopment activity shall be required to bring the entire development on the lot into full compliance with all of the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 9-101)

    9-102.2 Repair, service or sales use of parking facilities. It shall be unlawful to use any required off-street parking or loading facilities for motor vehicle repair work, service, display or sales of any kind, except as expressly permitted elsewhere in this article. 
    9-102.3 Use of required parking as commercial or public lot. No area designated as a required parking area in connection with any designated building or use shall be operated as a commercial or public parking lot providing parking spaces for the general public or for the occupants, tenants, customers, clients or residents of any other use or activity for a fee or other compensation. 
    9-102.4 Ingress and egress. All entrances and exits to parking and loading areas from a public right-of-way shall be subject to specific approval of the Planning Commission by approval of a site development plan in accordance with article XIV, subsection 14-103.4. In no event shall parking and loading spaces be provided in a manner requiring the backing out of vehicles into public rights-of-way. 
    9-102.5 Location of parking or loading space. All required off-street parking or loading spaces shall be provided on the same parcel of land occupied by the use or building to which it is appurtenant. Provided, however, that where there are, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, practical difficulties in satisfying the requirement for parking space and/or if the public safety or convenience would be better served by another location, the Planning Commission may authorize subject to the following conditions an alternative location: 
1.  Required accessory off-street parking facilities may be provided elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal use served is located, provided that the property occupied as parking is in the same possession, either by deed, by easement, or by long-term lease which has a term equal to or exceeding the projected life of the facility occupied by the principal use, and further provided that the owner shall be bound by covenants filed on record in the Office of the County Clerk, requiring the owner and his heirs and assigns, as well as subsequent owners, heirs or assigns, to maintain the required number of off-street parking spaces during the existence of such principal use. 
2.  Pedestrian access shall be available within a walking distance of not more than 500 feet measured from the nearest point of public access to the building to the nearest part of the accessory parking area. 
3.  Such separated parking space shall be usable without causing unreasonable traffic congestion, detriment to any residential neighborhood, or hazard to pedestrians or vehicular traffic. 
    9-102.6 Phasing of parking facilities within industrial developments. When any manufacturing activity is located within any industrial district, the construction of required parking spaces may be phased as required by occupant loading facilities. 
    9-102.7 Zoning of accessory parking. All accessory parking facilities, whether provided in fulfillment of or in excess of the requirements of this article, and whether located on the same or on a different lot from the principal use, shall be located on property zoned within the same or a less restrictive zoning district as the principal use served by the parking. 
    9-102.8 Joint parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be provided and used collectively or jointly in any zoning district in which separate off-street parking facilities for each constituent use would be permitted, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  A legally sufficient written agreement assuring perpetual joint usage of said common parking for the combination of uses or buildings is properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form and execution by the City Attorney, and filed with and made part of the application for a building permit. 
2.  Up to 25 percent of the parking spaces required for a theater or other place of evening entertainment, for a church, for multifamily dwelling units, or for a school, may be provided and used jointly by banks, offices, retail stores, repair shops, service establishments, and similar uses not normally open, used, or operated during evening hours, if specifically approved by the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners; provided, however, that written agreement assuring the retention for such purpose shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form and execution by the City Attorney, filed and made part of the application for a building permit. Such approval may be rescinded by the Board of Commissioners of the City and additional parking shall be obtained by the owners in the event that the Board determines that such joint use is resulting in a public nuisance or otherwise adversely affecting the public health, safety or welfare. 
    9-102.9 Variance in the required number of parking and loading spaces. The number of parking and loading spaces to be constructed may be less than the number of spaces required herein in the event that the following conditions are met to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission: 
1.  Evidence is submitted firmly documenting that the special nature of the use, activity, or building proposed requires less parking area or spaces than required by this ordinance for the same. 
2.  The site development plan submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission in accordance with article XIV, subsection 14-103.3, indicates that the location and layout of that portion of the parking requirement deemed unnecessary can and will be constructed accordingly in the event that the Planning Commission determines at any time that all or any portion of this parking is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare. 
3.  In no event shall that portion of the required parking or loading which is so designated, but not constructed as provided herein be counted as open space or other nonpaved area required by other provisions of this ordinance.

Sec. 9-104. - Off-street parking lot design standards. 
    9-104.1 Design objectives. Parking areas shall be designed with careful regard given to orderly arrangement, topography, amenity of view, ease of access and as an integral part of the overall site design. For reasons of use and appearance, it is desirable that parking areas be level or on terraces formed with the slope of the land. Changes in level between such terraces should be formed by retaining walls or landscaped banks. Efforts shall be made to ensure that a parking area does not dominate a site or building. Such efforts may include depressing the level of the parking area, construction of earth berms, dividing large lots into smaller sub-lots and other similar techniques. Wherever possible, the size of parking areas visible from public streets shall be minimized. 
    9-104.2 Submission of site plan. Any application for a building permit, or for a conditional use permit where no building permit is necessary, that requires five or more accessory off-street parking spaces to be provided on a zone lot, shall be accompanied by a site development plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned. Said plan shall show the location design and layout of such parking facilities and shall be subject to approval by the Planning Commission. A site plan drawn to meet the requirements of article XIV, subsection 14-103.3, will comply. There shall be included either as a part of the parking area site plan or as a separate plan a landscaping plan for the parking area. Such landscape plan shall show any trees, shrubs, flowers, or ground covers together with; retaining walls or screens; walkways; and traffic barriers. (See article X.) 
    9-104.3 Design of parking stalls and maneuvering spaces.

Sec. 9-105. - Off-street loading. 
    9-105.1 Computing loading requirements. The number of loading spaces required for a specific development proposal shall be based on the requirements listed in subsection 9-105.2, Off-street loading space requirements, and the following provisions: 
1.  Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in this section, the Zoning Administrator shall apply the loading requirements specified for a listed use most similar to the use for which said permit is requested. 
2.  Multiple uses in a building. When a building contains more than one use, and the floor area used for each use is below the minimum for required loading spaces but the aggregate total floor area is greater than the minimum, then off-street loading space shall be provided as if the entire building was used for that use in the building for which the most spaces are required. 
3.  Fractions. When measurements determining the number of required additional loading spaces beyond the floor area ranges given in subsection 9-105.2, Off-street loading spaces requirements, result in fractions, any fraction less than one-half shall be disregarded and any fraction of one-half or more shall be rounded upward to the next highest full number. 
    9-105.2 Off-street loading space requirements. The minimum number of off-street loading spaces to be provided for a building shall be as indicated in table 9-105A. 
    9-105.3 Loading area design standards.

Sec. 9-106. - Access management. 
    9-106.1 Traffic impact studies. See the Subdivision Regulations for details and requirements regarding traffic study requirements for development or redevelopments. 
    9-106.2 Protection of residential areas. In order to minimize the destabilizing effects on residential areas, access to commercial and industrial activities shall be designed so as to minimize the intrusion of nonresidential and nonlocal traffic onto local residential streets. 
    9-106.3 Access control. In order to promote the safety of the motorist and pedestrian and to minimize traffic congestion and conflict by reducing the points of contact, the following access control regulations shall apply (see illustration 9-106A): 
Illustration 9-106A 

1.  Access from arterial or collector public ways. The city may require: 
a.  That corner lots or double frontage lots not derive access from arterial or collector public ways. 
b.  That access to residential lots from collectors and minor arterial shall be provided by joint driveways. 
c.  That direct access to residential lots from major arterial highways designated in the major thoroughfare plan not be permitted. 
2.  Minimum separation between driveways. For each permitted nonresidential driveway, there shall be a corresponding minimum road frontage of: 
a.  At least 200 feet along routes designated in the major thoroughfare plan as rural arterial highways and six lane urban arterial highways. 
b.  At least 150 feet along routes designated in the major thoroughfare plan as five lane and three lane urban arterial highways. 
c.  At least 100 feet along routes designated in the major thoroughfare plan as four lane urban arterial highways and two lane collector highways. 
The City will consider requests for modifications to this standard to permit the construction of double driveways, serving the same property from the same street, on a case by case basis. Double driveways shall be allowed only on lots with more than 150 feet of road frontage. In all cases, the separation between double driveways shall be at least 25 feet and shall also be greater than the width of the wider adjoining driveway. The City may require that access to proposed new lots be provided indirectly via cross connections, joint access easements, or local access roads. Nonresidential lots of record as of the date of the enactment of this ordinance shall have direct access to at least one public way. 
3.  Minimum clearances. The minimum corner clearance between proposed new driveways and existing or proposed thoroughfares shall be at least 50 feet. In order to ensure adequate storage space for vehicles stopped at a signalized intersection, the City may require that the nearside corner clearance shall be at least 100 feet. Corner clearances shall be as defined in the Rules and Regulations for Constructing Driveways on State Highway Rights-of-Way, adopted by the Tennessee Department of Highways and effective April 3, 1967. Except when access is via a joint driveway, the distance between the frontage property line and the tangent projection of the nearest edge of each driveway, measured along the edge of the public way, shall be at least 15 feet for nonresidential driveways and at least five feet for residential driveways. 
4.  Design standards for nonresidential driveways. 
a.  For access to thoroughfares where the posted speed limit is 35 mph, or less, all nonresidential driveways shall be constructed with a minimum return radius of 15 feet and a minimum horizontal width of 25 feet. 
b.  For access to thoroughfares where the posted speed limit is 40 mph, nonresidential driveways shall be constructed with: 
i.  A minimum return radius of 20 feet and a minimum driveway width of 30 feet. 
ii.  A minimum return radius of 25 feet and a minimum driveway width of 25 feet. 
c.  For access to thoroughfares where the posted speed limit is 45 mph, nonresidential driveways shall be constructed with a right turn deceleration lane and: 
i.  A minimum return radius of 25 feet and a minimum driveway width of 40 feet. 
ii.  A minimum return radius of 30 feet and a minimum driveway width of 30 feet. 
d.  The City will review proposed driveway designs for access to other thoroughfares on a case-by-case basis. 
e.  Where required, deceleration lanes shall be designed to provide for sufficient reduction in travel speeds as well as for vehicle storage. 
f.  Driveway openings shall be no wider than necessary to ensure conformance with this standard. 
g.  All nonresidential driveways shall be permanently paved. Lanes shall be clearly designated and lane uses shall be clearly and permanently marked. 
h.  The centerline of every nonresidential two way driveway shall intersect the centerline of the public way at an angle between 75 and 90 degrees. 
i.  For other nonresidential driveways, the intersection angle shall be subject to the approval of the City. 
5.  Design standards for residential driveways. Where permitted, residential driveways fronting collector and arterial routes designated in the major thoroughfare plan shall be designed so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back onto these highways. 
6.  Relationship to state standards. Where the driveway design and location standards listed above are not in conformance with the standards of the Tennessee Department of Transportation, the City may require conformance with whichever standard is more restrictive. 
    9-106.4 Joint and shared accessways. 
1.  Joint use driveways. Wherever feasible, the City may require the establishment of a joint use driveway to serve two or more properties. If a proposed development abuts an existing development that contains an existing joint access driveway, the vehicular circulation of the proposed development shall be designed to connect to the abutting access and circulation areas. If a proposed development abuts existing undeveloped property, the vehicular circulation of the proposed development shall contain a joint access driveway which is designed to connect to the abutting property when such property is developed. 
2.  Cross access corridors. The Planning Commission, in conjunction with the City Engineer shall be authorized to designate cross access corridors on properties adjacent to arterial and major collector streets. All developments within the affected area shall be designed so as to provide for mutual coordinated parking, access and circulation systems. 
3.  Recording access easements. Whenever joint access driveways or cross access corridors are provided in accordance with the provisions of this section, no development plan shall be approved unless such plan grants an easement for cross access to and from abutting properties. Such designation shall be referenced on all plats of subdivision for any affected property. 
4.  Closing of interim driveways. Whenever a permanent joint use driveway and/or a cross access corridor is constructed as required by the provisions of this section, all preceding temporary or interim driveways shall be closed and eliminated. The owner(s) of all properties which involve the use of a permanent joint use driveway and/or a cross access corridor shall enter into a written agreement with the City to be recorded in the public records of the County and running with the land, that existing temporary and/or interim driveways shall be closed and eliminated following construction of both sides of a joint access. 
    9-106.5 Visibility areas. In order to safely accommodate vehicular movements to and from public streets, the following sight distance and visibility provisions shall be required: 
1.  Street intersections. At all points of intersection of public and private streets no fence, wall, hedge or other planting or structure that will obstruct vision at any point above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets shall be erected, placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by the said right-of-way lines and a straight line joining said right-of-way lines at points where they are 35 feet distant from the intersection of the right-of-way lines and measured along said right-of-way lines. 
2.  Driveway intersections. In all zone districts, no fence, wall, hedge or other planting or structure that will obstruct vision at any point where any private driveway intersects a public street shall be erected, placed or maintained within 35 feet in all directions measured from all points along the property line across vehicles are intended to pass. 
    9-106.6 Measurement. For the purposes of this section, distances shall be measured in the following manner: 
1.  Distance between driveways. Distances between driveways shall be measured along the right-of-way line from the nearest points of intersection of the driveways with the right-of-way line. In the event that the curb return of a driveway begins outside of the right-of-way, the point of intersection of the extension of the driveway curb or edge shall be used for measurement purposes. 
2.  Distance from intersection. The distance from street intersections shall be measured from the nearest intersection of the existing right-of-way lines or extension thereof. For streets designated to be widened at a future time by the adopted major thoroughfare plan, measurement shall be made from the ultimate right-of-way. 
3.  Distance from ramps of limited access highways. The distance from ramps for limited access highways shall be measured from the point where the right-of-way for the ramp intersects the right-of-way for the street serving the lot.

(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 10-103) 
Sec. 10-104. - Landscaping procedures. 
    When an application is made for a permit on any land where the landscaping requirements of this article are applicable, such permit application shall be accompanied by a landscaping plan. All landscape plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect or landscape contractor licensed by the State of Tennessee. Such plan shall contain the information indicated in subsection 10-104.1, or any additional information as required by the Zoning Administrator to enable a determination to be made as to whether the permit application is in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. When a site plan is required by article XIV of this ordinance, to be approved on land where the provisions of this article are applicable the landscape plan shall accompany such site plan. 
10-104.1 Plan content. Landscape plans shall be drawn to scale, including dimensions and distances, and shall clearly delineate: 
1.  Location, general type and quality of existing vegetation, including all trees which are five inches or greater in caliper, tree masses composed of trees smaller than five inches in caliper, as well as smaller trees which may be retained to fulfill the requirements of section 10-112, Street yard landscape regulations; 
2.  The number, location, species and caliper of existing trees located between the principal building and the public street right-of-way which are to be maintained or preserved for credit as per subsection 10-112.6, along with other existing vegetation proposed to be saved; 
3.  Methods and details for protecting existing vegetation during construction; 
4.  Schedules with the botanical and common name, size (at the time of planting), quantity and spacing of all proposed landscape material; 
5.  Plant lists or schedules showing both the required and proposed quantities of plants; 
6.  Plans, shown over a base map which displays existing and proposed topography, indicating the proposed location of plants and the location and description of other landscape improvements, such as earth berms, walls, fences, screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights, parking and vehicular use areas, including existing and proposed parking spaces, access aisles, driveways, loading and storage areas; 
7.  Planting and installation details and notes necessary to ensure conformance with all required standards; 
8.  Means for supplying water including irrigation systems, or the location of hydrants or other sources of water supply. A source of water must be available to meet the requirements of this article; 
9.  Any other information which the City may require to clarify the applicant's plan and it's ability to meet the stated purposes and intents of this article. 
10-104.2 As-built certification. Upon completion of the landscaping required by this ordinance, the designer shall certify that the plan has been followed in the installation. (See subsection 14-103.6, Construction to be in accordance with approved plans.) The designer shall note any areas where the installation deviates from the approved plan and the approvals, secured under the provision of subsection 10-114.4, to allow that deviation. Any and all such approvals of variance shall be obtained prior to issuance of a use and occupancy permit. 
10-104.3 Enforcement of landscaping plans. In no event shall a permanent use and occupancy permit be issued, unless and until all elements of landscaping have been installed and such installation has been certified by the City as complete and in accordance with the approved landscape plan. If, at the time application is made for a use and occupancy permit, required nonstructural landscaping (i.e. plant material) is not in place and it can be determined by the City that because of the unavailability of plant material or that requiring completion of the landscaping at the time of such request would jeopardize the health of the plant material or weather conditions prohibit the completion of planting, the developer/owner shall make the following arrangements to secure a temporary use and occupancy permit: 
1.  The developer/owner shall produce an agreement in the form of a legally binding contract between the developer and a landscaping installer/contractor specifying the manner and the date by which the landscaping, as shown on approved plans, is to be installed. The maximum period for installation of the required landscaping shall be the lesser of one year or one growing season from the date of application for a temporary use and occupancy permit. The City shall be a third party beneficiary to said contract. This agreement shall be secured by a bond or letter of credit made payable to the City in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the landscaping plus 50 percent. In the event of the failure of the developer to execute this contract and thereby perform the work specified in the plan, the City shall call the bond or letter of credit and fund the contract to have the work accomplished. 
2.  The developer shall also agree in writing that he, or his successors or assigns shall provide the required planting as specified in the contract required in [subpart] paragraph 1, above, as a condition for issuance of a permanent use and occupancy permit and that no permanent use and occupancy permit shall be issued unless and until such landscaping is installed. The developer/owner shall also agree that the principal use shall be discontinued should the required planting not be provided as specified in [subpart] paragraph 1, above. Violations of these provisions shall constitute an unauthorized illegal occupancy of the principal use and no further permits of any type shall be approved until the landscaping is installed.

1.  Materials and construction standards. Walls shall be constructed of natural stone, brick or other weatherproof materials arranged in a linear, serpentine, or other alignment. Fences shall be constructed of wood or other weatherproof, durable materials generally used in the exterior construction of buildings. Fence posts shall be structurally stable based on the material used, and shall have a maximum spacing of eight feet o.c [on center]. If wood is used, the posts shall be four inches by four inches minimum. Posts shall be set in or anchored to crowned concrete footings. The base of the footings shall be at least 24 inches below finished grade. If wood is used for any member, it shall be softwood treated with water-borne preservative to the American Wood Preservers Institute Standard LP-2, for aboveground use or LP-22, for ground contact use, or all heart redwood, or all heart cedar. All cut surfaces of pressure treated lumber shall be waterproofed. If another material is used, it shall be weatherproof. Slats are to be minimum one-half inch in thickness and are to be placed on the outside of the fence, unless the design is two-sided (shadowbox, etc.). All hardware is to be galvanized or otherwise rustproofed. Wood horizontal members shall be installed bark-side up. Chainlink fencing may not be used to meet the requirements of this article. Chainlink fencing may be installed in the required landscape area only if it is in addition to the required continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall or earth mound. In industrial zones, there shall be no maximum height limitation on walls or fences; in all other zones, however, there shall be a six-foot height restriction when such fences are located within side and rear yards. All walls or fences used to meet the requirements of this article shall have a minimum opacity of 80 percent and shall not be used for erection or display of any sign or other advertising device. 
2.  Height and landscaping standards. The provisions of this section shall apply to walls constructed to fulfill the requirements of this article. 
a.  Freestanding walls. Any freestanding walls (except those directly surrounding trash containers) constructed to stand above ground, the purpose of which is privacy, visual screening, odor and/or noise retention, etc., shall be a minimum of six feet in height. 
b.  Interior facing retaining walls. Walls holding earthen material such as soil, gravel, etc., back from the interior of a site shall be unrestricted as to height. 
c.  Exterior facing retaining walls. Walls holding earthen material such as soil, gravel, etc., back from the exterior of a site shall be designed and stamp certified as to design and drainage characteristics by a licensed engineer. All walls shall be landscaped as follows: 
i.  A minimum of one ornamental tree or large shrub shall be installed for each 150 square feet of terraced area. These trees are to be evenly distributed across the length of the terrace. 
ii.  A minimum of three shrubs shall be placed between each two trees. 
iii.  A planting of grass or groundcover that is deemed to provide sufficient coverage shall be placed along the entire land surface area at the top of the wall to cover and to stabilize the earth from erosion. 
    10-108.2 Earth berms. Berms shall have a minimum height of 11/2 feet, a minimum crown width of two feet, a side slope no greater than 2:1 and shall be planted and covered with adequate plant material to prevent erosion. A difference in elevation between areas requiring screening does not constitute a berm. Berms which are at slopes greater than 3:1 or greater than three feet in height shall be planted with permanent vegetation which will cover the surface to prevent erosion and which does not require mowing to maintain a neat appearance. 
    10-108.3 Plants. All plant materials shall be living plants (artificial plants are prohibited) and shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  Quality. Plant materials used to meet the provisions of this ordinance shall comply with the standards of the American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1), American Association of Nurserymen, for size, quality and form and shall have passed any inspections required under state regulations. Bare root trees are prohibited. 
2.  Deciduous trees. Deciduous trees shall be species having an average mature crown spread of greater than 15 feet in Middle Tennessee and having trunk(s) which can be maintained with over five feet of clear trunk in areas which have visibility requirements. Trees having an average mature spread of crown less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping of the same so as to create the equivalent of a 15-foot crown spread. Trees shall be a minimum of eight feet in overall height and at least 13/4 inches in caliper at the time of planting. Trees of species whose roots are known to cause damage to public roadways or other public works shall not be planted closer than 15 feet to such public works, unless the tree root system is completely contained within a barrier for which the minimum interior container dimensions shall be five feet square and five feet deep and for which the construction requirements shall be four inches thick, reinforced concrete. 
3.  Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet high. 
4.  Understory trees. Trees and shrubs which are typically between ten and 25 feet in height at maturity in Middle Tennessee plantings and having a particularly notable ornamental or aesthetic quality. Ex: dogwoods, redbuds, goldenrain trees, Foster hollies, crepe myrtles, Japanese black pines. 
5.  Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least two feet in average height with three canes when installed. All plants shall conform to opacity, mature height and other requirements within four years after the date of final approval of each planting or replanting. Privet (ligustrum species) cannot meet the opacity requirements and may not be used to satisfy the requirement of this article. The height of the planting shall be measured from the level of the vehicular use area at the edge closest to the screening. 
6.  Vines. Vines shall be at least 12 inches high at planting and shall be trained to grow upon walls or fences. 
7.  Grass or ground cover. Grass shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns in Middle Tennessee and may be sodded, plugged, sprigged, or seeded; except in swales or other areas subject to erosion, where solid sod, erosion control, or suitable mulch shall be used. Temporary "nurse-crop" grass seed shall be sown for immediate protection until complete coverage, otherwise, is achieved. Grass sod shall be clean and free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Grassed areas shall be planted in such a manner as to provide 100 percent coverage after two full growing seasons. 
8.  Existing landscape material. Existing landscape material which to be retained to fulfill landscape requirements shall be shown on the required plan, and any material in satisfactory condition may be used to satisfy these requirements in whole or in part when, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator such material meets the requirements and achieves the objectives of this article. Existing healthy trees may be substituted for trees required for property or vehicular use area perimeter landscaping, or for interior landscaping by using the following criteria: A six-inch to 12-inch caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 150 square feet of landscape area may be substituted for two new trees of the required minimum size; a 12-inch to 24-inch caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 250 square feet of landscape area may be substituted for three new trees of the required minimum size; a 24-inch or greater caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 300 square feet of landscape area may be substituted for four trees of the required minimum size. The Zoning Administrator shall reinspect the condition of existing vegetation upon completion of construction, at which time the Administrator may require removal of any vegetation deemed by the officer to be damaged beyond repair and the applicant shall replant the area with trees to meet the conditions, otherwise, in force. 
9.  Recommended listing of plants to be developed. A listing of plants recommended for use in meeting the various standards and requirements established by this article is to be developed and maintained by the City. Such listing shall also indicate plants with characteristics considered undesirable and not to be utilized in plantings required by this article. 
    10-108.4 Landscaping in easements. Landscaping may be located in areas reserved for utility or other easements as long as all the landscape requirements can be fully met. Otherwise, landscape buffer plantings shall be provided in addition to, and separate from, any easement. (See subsection 10-111.3, [subpart] paragraph 4.) 
    10-108.5 Landscaping at driveway and street intersections. To ensure that landscape materials do not constitute a driving hazard, a sight triangle shall be maintained at all street intersections and intersections of driveways with streets. 
    10-108.6 Joint driveways and common vehicular use areas. Vehicular use area screening shall not be required between a vehicular use area and the adjoining property where a property line divides a driveway used for common access to two or more properties nor when both of the following conditions exist: 
1.  The vehicular use areas are for the required parking for the properties or the common use of the properties (as substantiated by a reciprocal parking and access agreement); and 
2.  A site development plan for the properties has been approved by the Planning Commission. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 10-108) 
Sec. 10-109. - Vehicular surface area landscaping. 
    10-109.1 Intent, purposes and application. It is the intent of this section to modify and reduce the deleterious visual, environmental and aesthetic effects of vehicular surface areas. The landscape requirements herein have been developed to: filter and reduce the glare of headlight and reflected sunlight from parked automobiles onto the public street rights-of-way; to separate the public from the ill effects of fumes and dust; to visually modify the appearance of parking areas and vehicular surface areas, to encourage the construction of such necessary areas in a manner that more closely follows the existing natural contours of the land; to distribute planting areas around and within the parking areas; to modify the rate of stormwater runoff and increase the capability of groundwater recharge in urban areas; to provide shade, noise attenuation, filtering the air of particulate and gaseous pollutants and other beneficial environmental effects to the microclimate; to prevent the overcrowding of land; and to break the visual blight created by large expanses of vehicular surface areas. These requirements shall apply to all vehicular surface areas, required or otherwise, regardless of the zoning district wherein they are located. 
    10-109.2 Street yard vehicular surface plantings. 
1.  Applicability. All edges of vehicular surface areas within 50 feet of any street right-of-way are required to have a visually modifying screen or barrier between the vehicular surface area and the right-of-way. 
2.  Plants and materials. The owner may use natural plants, fences, walls or earthen berms or any combination thereof to meet the requirements of this section so long as all the minimum criteria set forth below are met. 
a.  The natural plants, fences, walls, earthen berms or combination thereof, must occupy a minimum of 75 percent of a vertical rectangular plane equal to the peripheral length of the vehicular area in feet, times an average of three feet six inches as measured from the surface edge of the vehicle area. Such rectangular plane shall be exclusive of driveways and sight lines used for automobile ingress and egress. No additional consideration towards meeting the 75 percent average requirement shall be given for any material greater than 84 inches in height. 
b.  No more than six continuous lineal feet of vertical plane as measured and viewed perpendicular from the street may be void of any natural plants, berms, closed fences or walls or combinations, thereof. 
c.  See subsection 10-108.1, [subpart] subparagraph 1, Materials and construction standards, for standards of construction and appearance. Additional planting materials shall be provided so that no more than two-thirds of the surface area of the fence or wall is visible from the street within three years of erection of the structure. Forty percent of this plant material may be deciduous. 
d.  All berms installed shall meet the standards of subsection 10-108.2. 
e.  All natural shrubs installed to satisfy the requirements of this section shall be a locally adapted species expected to reach a minimum height of 30 inches within three years of planting. Live vegetation planted on berms may have a lesser mature height provided the combined height of the berm and the plantings after three years are at least 30 inches high. Forty percent of all shrubs may be deciduous. 
    10-109.3 Interior plantings. 
1.  Planting areas. In addition to all other landscape requirements, all vehicular surface areas, temporary or permanent (excluding parking structures) shall provide and maintain landscaped planting areas within the interior of the vehicular surface area. Each planting area shall contain a minimum of 300 square feet in area with minimum dimensions of seven feet and, except for vehicular display areas, shall contain at least one and not more than two locally adapted canopy trees a minimum of 13/4-inch caliper and a minimum height of eight feet. 
2.  Trees required. Trees shall be required at a minimum rate of one natural canopy tree for every 2,000 square feet of total vehicular surface area. All vehicular surface areas located within the same block which serve one or more businesses or uses of land or share unified ingress and egress shall be considered as a single vehicular surface area for the purpose of computing the required number of trees, notwithstanding ownership. 
3.  Planting area locations. Landscaped planting areas are to be located within or adjacent to the parking area as tree islands, at the end of parking bays, inside seven-foot wide or greater medians between rows of cars, or as part of continuous street or transitional protective yards. The number, size and shape of landscape planting areas shall be at the discretion of the owner; however, tree spacing shall not exceed a maximum of 195 feet or three double-loaded bays of parking, which ever is less. Landscaped planting areas shall be distributed in a manner, which fulfills the purposes of subsection 10-109.1. For vehicular display areas which are not required to have trees, measurements shall be made from the edge of the landscaped planting areas, and no stored vehicle shall be farther than 50 feet from the edge of any landscaped planting area. 
4.  Parking reductions permitted. The number of off-street parking spaces required in article IX of this ordinance, may be reduced by the following ratio: The square footage of required interior landscaped planting area divided by 150 but no fraction thereof, provided that no reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces authorized by article IX, in excess of ten percent shall occur without prior approval of the Board of Commissioners which shall first determine if further reductions will cause on-street parking congestion. 
5.  Shrubs within planting areas. Any vehicular surface area, including vehicular display areas, shall be provided with landscaped areas containing shrubs. Shrubs shall obtain a minimum size of 30 inches within three years of planting. All shrubs shall be a minimum of 18 inches tall when planted. No more than 40 percent of required shrubs may be deciduous. Shrubs shall be required at the rate of one shrub per 500 square feet of vehicular surface area. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 10-109) 
Sec. 10-110. - Loading area, display area and utility service area landscaping requirements. 
    10-110.1 Application. All loading areas and display areas with minimum dimensions of 15 feet or more, designated short-term storage areas and utility service areas not screened by an intervening building, established after the effective date of [the ordinance from which this article is derived], shall be screened from view from any public street right-of-way for their entire length except for necessary points of access. 
    10-110.2 Loading areas. 
1.  General screening. See subsection 10-108.1, [subpart] subparagraph 1, Materials and construction standards, for construction and appearance criteria. Additional planting materials shall be provided so that no more than two-thirds of the surface area of any closed fence or wall is visible from the street within three years of erection of the structure. The screening may also be accomplished with a natural evergreen plant material which can be expected to reach a height of six feet or greater within three years of planting. Any plant materials used to fulfill these requirements shall be a minimum of three feet in height when planted and there shall be no gap greater than four feet between plant material. 
2.  Loading areas in close proximity to residential properties. Loading areas located closer than 50 feet to a property line of land located within a residential zoning district shall be screened from view from the residential property with an earthen berm, closed fence or solid wall which is at least six feet high. (See subsection 10-108.1, [subpart] subparagraph 1, Materials and construction standards, for standards of construction and appearance of fences.) Additional planting materials shall be provided so that no more than two-thirds of the surface area of the closed fence or wall is visible from any adjoining residence within three years of erection of the structure. 
    10-110.2 Display areas. Screening for display areas may be accomplished by natural plants, closed fences, walls or earthen berms or any combination thereof to meet the requirements of this section so long as all the minimum criteria set forth below are met. 
1.  Screening standard. The natural plants, solid fences, walls, earthen berms or combinations thereof, must occupy 75 percent of a vertical rectangular plane equal to the peripheral length of the display area, in feet, times an average of two feet six inches as measured from the surface edge of the display area. Such rectangular plane shall be exclusive of driveways and sight lines used for automobile access. No additional consideration towards meeting the 75 percent average requirement shall be given for any material greater than 66 inches in height. No more than six continuous lineal feet of the vertical plane as measured and viewed perpendicular from the street may be void of any natural plants, berms, closed fences or walls or combination, thereof. 
2.  Use of fences and walls. See subsection 10-108.1, [subpart] subparagraph 1, Materials and construction standards, for standards of construction and appearance of fences. Additional planting materials shall be provided so that no more than two-thirds of the surface area of the fence or wall is visible from any adjoining residence within three years of erection of the structure. Forty percent of this plant material may be deciduous. 
4.  Use of berms. Any berms installed shall meet the standards set out in subsection 10-108.2. 
5.  Size and quality of plant material. All natural shrubs installed to satisfy the requirements of this subsection shall be a locally adapted species expected to reach a minimum height of 24 inches and a minimum spread of 24 inches within three years of planting. All shrubs shall be a minimum of 18 inches tall when planted. Live vegetation planted on berms may have a lesser mature height provided that the combined height of the berm and the plantings after three years are at a height of at least 24 inches. No more than 40 percent of required shrubs may be deciduous. 
    10-110.3 Utility service areas. Screening for utility service areas may be accomplished by locally adapted plantings, evergreen or deciduous, which are at least 18 inches tall when planted and are expected to reach a height and width equal to or greater than the utility service structures which are required to be screened. Screening for utility service areas in the right-of-way is to be installed by the utility company or the person who installed the service; in all other instances, the property owner shall install the plantings. 
    10-110.4 Temporary storage areas. Temporary storage of goods outside a building shall occur in such a manner as to screen from adjacent properties as effectively as the building and the vehicular use area. Such goods, whether in storage trailers, temporary structures or simply stacked on the site, shall be placed in a location which has been approved as a part of the site plan, and shall not obstruct required parking, loading spaces, travel ways or fire lanes, nor shall such goods be stored within a required setback. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 10-110) 
Sec. 10-111. - Transitional protective yard requirements. 
    10-111.1 Intent. This section requires transitional protective yards to be provided and maintained when certain land uses are adjacent to or directly across the street from each other to protect the uses from the traffic, noise, glare, trash, activity, vibration, odor, visual disorder and other harmful or noxious effects likely to be emitted by or associated with a more intensive use. Transitional protective yard regulations are also required to prevent adverse community appearance, to protect the character of the area, to conserve the values of buildings and land and to provide adequate light and air. Transitional protective yards of differing depths and widths are required depending upon the combination of uses and the adverse effects which the uses have. 
    10-111.2 Location and extent of protective yards. Transitional protective yards are measured from the property line of the property to be screened to vehicular surface areas, buildings, the loading, display, storage and service areas. No transitional screening shall be required in street yards provided in accordance with the provisions of section 10-112, Street yard landscape regulations. Transitional protective yards may overlap other yard areas but yard areas used as transitional protective yards must comply with the requirements of this section. Nothing contained in this section shall reduce the minimum requirements of any other yards required by this ordinance. Whenever two or more transitional yards are simultaneously applicable, as for example a property which contains two or more uses, then the more stringent regulation is controlling. If two or more different uses are present on one lot, only those uses which constitute ten percent or more of the gross floor area of the building or land area shall be considered. 
    10-111.3 Planting materials. 
1.  Trees. All deciduous trees which are planted to meet the minimum requirements of this section shall be a minimum height of eight feet in height and 13/4 inches in caliper and shall have an expected mature height of 35 feet or greater, unless subject to an overhead utility line, in which case the mature height may be less. One-half the required trees shall be locally adapted natural evergreen species, a minimum of six feet in height at the time of planting. Two evergreen trees, a minimum of 41/2 feet in height at the time of planting, may be substituted for each required evergreen tree. These trees shall be distributed throughout the transitional protective yard in accordance with the approved landscape plan. 
2.  Shrubs. Shrubs planted to meet the minimum requirements of this section shall be a minimum of 11/2 feet in height when planted and be expected to reach a height of six feet or greater within five years of planting. Shrubs planted on berms may have a lesser mature height provided that the combined height of the plantings and the berm after five years is at least six feet. Shrubs shall be planted in such a way as to form a continuous row, with no shrub being greater than ten feet from another as measured from the property line. Shrubs shall be planted in two or more overlapping rows, and a minimum of 50 percent of the required shrubs shall be locally adapted evergreen species. 
3.  Quantities of material required. In the required transitional protective yard, natural trees and shrubs shall be planted in the quantities shown on the chart entitled, Transitional protective yard requirements of subsection 10-111.4 (below). All required plantings shall be no further than 50 feet from the property line, which is to be screened. 
4.  Plantings within easements. With the exception of easements for overhead utility services, vegetative screening shall not be placed within a utility or drainage easement if the easement holder or the City object to such plantings. Vegetative screening shall not be placed within the flowage area of swales or drainage ditches. Should either the easement holder or the City object to vegetative screening in the easement, the required plantings shall be installed in the same number as otherwise required in the portion of the transitional protective yard remaining after exclusion of the easement area. (See subsection 10-108.4.) 
5.  Modifications and alternatives. The height and quantity of required planting materials and fencing in areas immediately contiguous to street yards required by section 10-112, may be modified as an alternate method authorized by section 10-107, when such screening will not serve any useful purpose due to the location of uses, vehicles, buildings, structures, storage, loading, display or service areas or when such screening will obstruct traffic visibility. 
    10-111.4 Determination of transitional protective yard requirements. Generally, a transitional protective yard shall be located at the perimeter of the building site along zoning district boundaries, or otherwise coincident with the edge of a specified facility that is to be screened, and shall not be located within in any portion of the public right-of-way. The following procedure shall be followed to determine the standard of transitional protective yard required along a zoning district boundary: 
Step A. Determine the zone district for the proposed development site as well as that of the abutting site(s). 
Step B. Determine the transitional protective yard standard required for each building site boundary (or portion thereof) by referring to table 10-111.4. Read down the column beneath the zone district of the proposed site development and across the row, which listed the zone district of the abutting site. The letter in the grid square where the column and the row intersect is the required standard for the transitional protective yard. 
Step C. Select one width/screening option from the appropriate group among those listed in figures 10-111.4A through 10-111.4D. Any of the listed screening variations shown on the appropriate figure shall satisfy the requirement between the abutting zone districts. (Ex: A-1, A-2, or A-3, may be used to meet the requirements for an A standard, transitional protective yard). 
Step D. When calculating required numbers of plant materials, round all fractions to the next whole number. 
Calculation of Required Plants for a C-3, Transitional Protective Yard for 275-foot Frontage Required canopy trees 275/100 x 6 = 2.75 x 6 = 16.5, round up to 17 canopy trees Required understory trees 275/100 x 3 = 2.75 x 3 = 8.25, round up to 9 understory trees Required shrubs 275/100 x 24 = 66 shrubs  





    10-111.5 Existing vegetation. 
1.  Credit for existing vegetation. So long as the required level of visual barrier is provided by the resulting transitional protective yard, existing vegetation which meets or exceeds the quantity, spacing and height standards, may be used to satisfy the requirements of subsection 10-111.3. Provided, however, no encroachments shall occur within the greater of either a seven-foot radius or one foot in diameter for each inch of circumference of the existing tree and that the provisions of subsection 10-112.6, are met. 
2.  Reduction of required plantings. The amount of required shrubs in a transitional protective yard may be reduced by 50 percent, if in that yard existing trees meeting the space, quantity and specification requirements of subsection 10-111.3, are preserved and protected from encroachment, and the reduced number of shrubs still meets the intent of this ordinance for screening at the level of the groundplane. 
3.  Supplemental plantings. Supplemental natural evergreen shrub plantings may be required, however, if it can be reasonably inferred that after five years, the existing vegetation will not continually provide a yearround foliage screen between properties from the natural grade to six feet above grade. Where such supplemental shrub plantings are required, the plantings shall have a minimum height of 11/2 feet when installed with an expected height of six feet or greater within five years after planting and shall be planted so that there are no horizontal gaps greater than ten feet between shrubs as measured along the property lines. Where the existing vegetation on site does not meet the established criteria for spacing, quantity and size of plant, then the owner shall be required to plant only those trees and shrubs necessary to meet the established standards for the transitional protective yard required for the specific situation. All plants used for this purpose shall meet the standards set out in subsection 10-111.3. 
    10-111.6 Fences, walls and earthen berms. 
1.  Installation of closed fence or solid wall. A fence or solid wall may be used as the sole means to meet the requirements of this section, only if the ground area required for transition protective yards, other than such yards for uses requiring transitional protective yard standard D, adjoining either property developed residentially or zoned for any residential use, exceeds 20 percent of the lot area. 
2.  Height requirements. See [sub]section 10-108.1, [subpart] subparagraph 1, Materials and construction standards, for standards of construction and appearance of fences. 
3.  Width of transitional protective yards with closed fences and solid walls. If a fence or wall is erected pursuant to subpart 1 of this section, the width of the transitional protective yard may be reduced to one-half the required width. 
4.  Grade changes of six feet or more. Whenever a wall or fence is authorized to be constructed, in lieu of such construction, a natural or manmade grade separation at least six feet in elevation may be substituted; provided that the side slopes of such grade are not greater than 3:1, the developing property is located at an elevation lower than the properties to be screened and the change in grade achieves a similar screening effect as the wall or fence. 
5.  Earthen berms. Any earthen berm installed in a transitional protective yard which reduces the width of the transitional yard shall be constructed to meet the standards set out in subsection 10-108.2 and shall be planted in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10-111.3. A steeper slope than that specified in subsection 10-108.2, may be used in exceptional cases when all the following are met: 
a.  The steeper slope is sufficiently stabilized; 
b.  The screening objectives of subsection 10-111.3, are better achieved; and 
c.  Physical constraints of the site prevent the use of a flatter slope. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 10-111) 
Sec. 10-112. - Street yard landscape regulations. 
    10-112.1 Intent. It is the intent of this section to establish a landscape planting area parallel to the recorded public street right-of-way. This area shall contain plantings of trees and other live vegetation to provide a more pleasing view from the ways of travel, to provide continuity of vegetation throughout the City, to reduce the amount of impervious surface and reduce stormwater runoff, to filter air, provide shade and otherwise improve the microclimate and to preserve a remnant of the City's natural vegetative cover. 
    10-112.2 Applicability. Any use of land, including vehicular surface areas and parking structures, established after the effective date of [the ordinance from which] this article [is derived] shall provide a street yard along any existing or proposed public street right-of-way adjacent to or adjoining the property except those portions of the lot used for driveway construction in accordance with article IX, are exempt from all street yard requirements. The street yard shall be required as follows: 
1.  For existing developed lots with unexpired building permits issued prior to the time this article becomes applicable to the property, the required street yard shall be at least five feet wide as measured perpendicular to the public street right-of-way abutting the property. 
2.  For existing undeveloped lots platted prior to the application of this article to the property, the required street yard shall be at least five and no more than 25 feet wide measured perpendicular to the public street right-of-way abutting the property. The minimum area of the street yard in square feet, shall be equal to the length of the property line measured along the right-of-way, in linear feet, times ten. Widths in excess of 25 feet in width shall not be calculated in determining the minimum area. 
3.  For all new lots developed or otherwise platted and recorded after application of this article to the property the required street yard shall be at least 71/2 and no more than 25 feet wide measured perpendicular to the public street right-of-way abutting the property. The minimum area of the street yard, in square feet, shall be equal to the length of the property line measured along the right-of-way, in linear feet, times 15. Widths in excess of 25 feet in width shall not be calculated in determining the minimum area. 
4.  For properties which are either acquired by a condemner or which have a change in the type of use which results in a change in the type of occupancy of a building, the applicable required minimum street yard width as determined in [subparts] subsections 1. through 3., above, shall be provided in the same manner as set forth in subsection 10-103.4, except that the multiplier of five contained in subsection 10-103.4, shall be increased to equal the width of the applicable required minimum street yard. 
5.  For properties which have expansions or additions made after application of this article, the required minimum street yard widths shall be provided as set forth in subsection 10-103.4. 
    10-112.3 Alternative street yards. In lieu of the average 15-foot wide street yard area required by subsection 10-112.2, a minimum street yard area equal to 12 times the length of the recorded public right-of-way abutting the property may be substituted as an alternative, provided: 
1.  An inventory of all existing trees located within the street yard and sized five caliper inches or greater is shown on the site plan, or landscape plan, when no site plan is required. The inventory shall contain as a minimum the scientific name, caliper and location of all trees identified on the inventory; and 
2.  The species of existing trees shown on the inventory should have the characteristics required in subsection 10-112.5; and 
3.  The minimum number of existing trees shown on the inventory shall equal the average rate of six caliper inches of trees for each 50-foot linear distance of the street yard measured parallel to the street; and 
4.  One or more of the following requirements are met: 
a.  All trees shown on the inventory are [to be] preserved. Preservation of existing trees shall be done in accordance with subsection 10-112.6; 
b.  Each tree shown on the inventory which is not preserved in accordance with subsection 10-112.6, is replaced with one new tree equal to one-half of the caliper of the unpreserved tree, but the maximum required replacement size need not exceed six inch caliper; or 
c.  A continuous area of the street yard equal to at least 20 percent of the street yard area remains unaffected by land disturbing activities, and that located within this undisturbed area are trees at least one inch caliper which sum total of circumference or caliper equals the circumference or caliper of all trees required in that yard. 
Note. The required number of caliper inches shall be comprised of one or more trees, provided a total of six caliper inches is provided for each 50 linear feet of frontage and that no tree less than 13/4 inches in caliper shall be credited toward this requirement. 
    10-112.4 Use of street yards. Street yards required by the provisions of this ordinance shall be landscaped and properly maintained by the owner and shall have live vegetation, groundcover, grass, trees, shrubs, and may unless otherwise prohibited include fences or walls, screening for loading, utility and display areas, and plantings for vehicular surface areas. All fences shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance. No more than 15 percent of this required protective yard shall be covered with an impervious surface which may be used without limitation for walkways, fountains or walls, but not vehicular surface, storage, utility service, display, service or loading areas. 
    10-112.5 Trees within street yards. Street yards shall contain natural trees, either existing or planted, of at least eight feet in height and 13/4 inches caliper as follows: 
1.  No street yard shall contain less than one natural tree. 
2.  Each street yard shall contain an average of at least one tree for every 50 linear feet of street yard or fraction thereof, as measured from the corners of the property and shall be located so that at least one tree is within every 100 lineal feet of street yard or fraction thereof. Such street trees shall be planted at least ten feet from any tree on the right-of-way. Along street yards for display areas, the spacing of trees may be one natural tree every 150 lineal feet of the street yard or fraction thereof. 
3.  All required trees in the street yard must be a locally adapted species with an expected mature height of 35 feet or greater and an expected crown spread of at least 30 feet or greater unless subject to an overhead power line in which case the mature height may be less. 
    10-112.6 Preservation of existing trees. Preservation of existing live trees between the principal building and the public street right-of-way can be credited towards the tree planting requirements of this section according to the following ratio: The credit toward the required number of trees shall be a number equal to the value of one-sixth the sum in inches of the caliper(s) of each preserved tree(s) but no fraction thereof. To be included in the computation for credit for existing trees, each preserved tree must be a least 13/4 inches in caliper and be uniformly encircled by a protected ground area. At a minimum, this protected ground area for an existing tree shall be the greater of either a seven-foot radius or one foot in diameter for each inch of circumference of the tree, except those trees in parking lots which are already located inside planting areas with a minimum dimension of seven feet may be used. During construction activities, the protected ground area shall be clearly marked in the field. 
No credit will be allowed for any tree proposed to be retained if there is any encroachment within the protected ground area defined by a circle which has as its center the trunk of the tree or if the tree is unhealthy or dead. The replacement of dead or unhealthy trees which are used for credit may be accomplished provided the replacement trees shall be equal to the number of credited trees. 
For the purposes of this section an encroachment is defined as any change in the natural grade, construction of impervious surfaces, trenching or excavation, storage of equipment, materials or earth and the temporary or permanent parking or circulation of vehicles or equipment.

Juliet Building Codes Department upon approval of the sign through the Planning Department. 
6.  Approval of ground signs. The application for a sign permit for the erection of a ground/monument sign which is in excess of four feet in height and will require footers, may require a separate building permit application and which may be filed with the City of Mt. Juliet Building Codes Department upon approval of the sign registration through the Planning Department. Approval of the sign registration through the Planning Department does not constitute approval through the Building Codes Department. 
7.  Inspection. The Planning Department may inspect, at such times as deemed appropriate, each sign or other advertising structure regulated by this ordinance. The purpose of the inspection is to ascertain whether the structure is secure or insecure, whether in need of repair or removal, or not in conformance with the permit application or otherwise in violation of the provisions of this section.

C.  Transitional provisions. 
1.  Existing signs. All signs legally erected prior to the effective date of this ordinance are considered legal by this ordinance and may remain in place and in use, subject to certain restriction on time frames (if applicable for temporary signs), modification, replacement and other actions affecting the sign, as set forth in this ordinance. 
2.  Existing permits. All holders of permits for signs issued legally prior to the effective date of this ordinance may erect the signs which are the subject of such permits within the times allowed by such permits, and such signs shall then be treated as though they had been erected prior to the effective date of this ordinance. However, such permits may not be extended or amended unless the sign which is the subject of such permit will conform to all of the requirements of this ordinance. 
3.  Existing violations. All violations of the sign regulations repealed by this ordinance shall remain violations of this ordinances of the City of Mt. Juliet and all penalties and enforcement remedies set forth hereunder shall be available to the City of Mt. Juliet as though the violation were a violation of this ordinance. However, if the effect of this ordinance is to make a sign that was formerly nonconforming become conforming, then enforcement action shall cease except to the extent of collecting penalties (other than removal of the sign) for violations that occurred prior to the effective date of this ordinance. 
D.  Nonconforming signs. The utilization of a nonconforming sign and/or sign structure, as defined herein, may continue subject to the conditions and requirements noted below. When the use of a property changes (including but not limited to the redevelopment of the site or a change in the use of the business, the sign on that property must be brought into compliance with the provision of this article. 
1.  With the exception of repairs, maintenance and alterations (allowed pursuant to state law), no alterations to a nonconforming sign/sign structure shall be allowed. Unless otherwise allowed by law, any structural or other substantial improvement to a nonconforming sign (except for printing or refinishing/refacing the surface of the existing sign face or sign structure so as to maintain the appearance) shall be deemed an abandonment of the nonconforming status and shall result in the reclassification of such sign as an illegal sign. 
2.  Prior to any new sign being permitted or constructed on any site, all nonconforming signs that do not constitute off-site signs shall be brought into full compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any portion of a sign or structure declared unsafe by a City of Mt. Juliet Building Inspector. Such signs may be improved only to bring the sign in conformance with applicable safety requirements.

(Ord. No. 2016-30, § 1(Exh. A), 6-13-2016) 
Sec. 11-103. - Design guidelines and standards. 
    All signs shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
A.  Design review and conformance. Compliance with the following design standards is required for all new permanent signs including replacement signs for which a permit is required as per Appendix, Table A. The Planning Department shall, prior to the issuance of a sign permit as required, review such proposed signs and approve or deny as to conformance with the design standards contained in this ordinance. Denials and waivers, as applicable and in accordance with section 11-109, may be appealed through the Planning Commission. 
B.  Design principles. Signs should be designed with consideration to the effect the sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area. Signs can complement or detract from the character of a building. Therefore, particular attention should be given to the way in which the sign will read and whether its design, size, materials, shape, illumination, location, configuration, and character are appropriate to its intended audience or whether a more appropriate sign could better serve its intended purpose and, at the same time, be less visually disruptive. 
C.  Design guidelines. 
1.  Wall signage should be consistent in size within each development and should be proportional to the building on which each sign is placed. A sign which meets the maximum size limitations may not be appropriate to the scale of the buildings, its architectural features and the character established by the adjacent buildings. 
2.  Wall signs should match the architectural character of buildings within the development and area of the building on which the sign is to be placed in terms of style, location, configuration, materials and color. 
3.  Wall signs should not obstruct or crowd architectural elements or details such as cornices, pilasters, windows and other features which define the design of the building. 
4.  Sign materials must be permanent, durable, low maintenance and of similar quality to the principal structure. Appropriate materials for ground sign background, frame, support and ornamentation includes brick, natural stone (Including panels and limitation stone), wood and EIFS or similar material when use in combination with brick or stone. 
5.  Signs consisting of plastic faced channel letters should not be more than two colors. However, this is not to say that logos and other accents combined with letters may not have other colors. Any back lighting should be white in color. 
6.  Signs should not be of a material, color or design that attracts attention excessively and disrupts the public environment. 
7.  Entire signs may not be in the shape of a product or motif, i.e. soda bottle, burger or boot, however, may contact a shape/element within the sign. 
8.  Signs should be primarily for identifying the business and not predominantly for advertising products sold or services rendered. 
9.  Ground signs shall be in monument style in nature and design. Ground signs must be placed on a base of at least a minimum base of 12 inches in height flush with the sign and ground. Any sign posts must be concealed within the base and structure of the sign, i.e. with brick columns. 
10.  The ground sign base shall be constructed of the same material as the principal building with integrated colors. Where the principal building is not constructed of brick or stone, acceptable base materials shall include, brick, stone, stucco and split face block, or other materials acceptable to the Mt. Juliet Regional Planning Commission. 
11.  The ground sign base should be complemented by shrubs, flowers and/or other landscaping. This landscaping should be of a low-growing variety so as not to block the visibility of the sign. This landscaping should also be designed to hide or shield any external light source. 
12.  For sites with no principal building, the requirement for a monument design shall not be mandatory. However, the voluntary use of a monument sign shall use base materials as stated in [subsection] 10 above. If a monument sign is not used, supports for the sign shall include two vertical members spaced a width equal to the sign. Exposed metal, including 'painted' metal, shall not be used. 
13.  All freestanding signs will need to contact Building Codes to verify any required regulations and permits of the City of Mt Juliet Building Codes Department. 
D.  Computations. For commercial/industrial wall sign computation, see section 11-108.C.6. 
1.  Computation of sign area of individual signs. The sign area shall be determined by computing the area of the smallest square, rectangle, circle, triangle or combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits of the sign face (including any open areas within the sign face), writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. The sign face describes the entire area of a sign upon, against or through which the sign copy is placed including any background. 
2.  Computation of area of two-faced signs. Only one side of a two-faced sign shall be included in the computation of sign area. Where the inside angle of a two-faced sign exceeds 45 degrees, both sign faces shall be counted toward the sign area. 
3.  Computation of height. Sign height is measured from the average level of the grade below the sign to the topmost point of the sign structure. Average grade shall be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or newly established grade after construction. Any (berming), filling, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign, shall be computed as part of the sign height. 
4.  Lot frontage. Lot frontage is the distance for which a lot adjoins a public street from one lot line intersecting said street to the furthest distant lot line including the distances along not more than two streets for a corner lot or a double frontage lot. 
E.  Setbacks (temporary and permanent). 
1.  All permanent signs shall be setback at least two feet from a public right-of-way or private roadway or eight feet from the edge of pavement or back of curb, whichever is greater, unless a greater distance is required to remove such sign from the sight distance triangle, or otherwise specified by these provisions. No permanent sign shall be located within a public utility or drainage easement, without written approval from the affected agencies. 
2.  All temporary signs shall be located at least ten feet back from the street curb, edge of pavement, stabilized shoulder, or back of sidewalk, whichever is greater, unless a greater distance is required to remove such sign from the sight distance triangle, or otherwise specified by these provisions. No temporary signs, except temporary signs posted on residentially zoned property with a residential use and not impeding visibility along a public thoroughfare, shall be permitted within a public right-of-way. 
F.  Spacing. Lots shall generally be limited to one freestanding sign. In order to have additional freestanding signs the following shall be met. A maximum of two freestanding signs shall be allowed for any lot. All permanent freestanding signs on any single lot shall be a minimum of 200 feet from all other signs on the same property, whether on the same or different street frontage, and shall be measured from the closest parts of any two signs unless otherwise provided for by this article. Signs shall be oriented toward the street to which they are adjacent. 
G.  Visibility triangle. All entrance signs and freestanding signs located near the corners of an intersection, shall be located outside of the sight distance triangle. Such triangle shall be measured at a distance of 35 feet running parallel along each leg of the road right-of-way connecting them to form a triangular area. This area shall be free of any permanent or temporary signs that may inhibit a clear sight visibility for motorists. Where a private driveway and a right-of-way intersect the distance shall be measured from both sides of the center line of the driveway along the right-of-way/property line to create the visibility triangle. 
H.  Sign illumination. Sign illumination shall only be achieved through the following standards: 
1.  All electrical service to ground mounted signs shall be placed underground. Electrical service to other signs shall be concealed from public view. 
2.  General illumination standards. 
a.  Illumination should not interfere or distract from the message conveyed by the sign. 
b.  Lighting for signs shall not create a hazardous glare for pedestrians or vehicles either in a public street or on any private premises. 
c.  The light source, whether internal to the sign or external, shall be shielded from view. This requirement is not intended to preclude the use of creative exposed lighting. 
d.  Illumination should be appropriate for the location, use and character of the neighborhood. 
e.  Illumination should seem integrated into the building façade or property/neighborhood character. 
f.  Illuminated signs should not be illuminated after 10:00 p.m. or the close of business, whichever is later. 
g.  Flashing, blinking, revolving, or rotating lights are not permitted. 
h.  All exposed conduit and junction boxes should be concealed from public view. 
3.  Internal illumination standards. 
a.  Internally illuminated sign cabinets that allow the entire face to illuminate are prohibited. 
b.  The sign background or field should be opaque and of a non-reflective material. 
4.  External illumination standards. 
a.  External lighting fixtures that project light on a sign from above or below are strongly enforced. Light fixtures supported on the front of the building cast light on the sign and a portion of the facade immediately around the sign. The visual impact of this should be considered in lighting selection. 
b.  Light fixtures should be simples and unobtrusive in appearance and size. 
c.  Light fixtures should be positioned as to not obscure the sign's message and graphics. 
d.  Light sources should be shielded and such that the light source is directed aware from passersby. Light sources should be directed against the sign such that is does not shine onto adjacent property or cause glare for motorists and pedestrians. Bare light bulbs should not be exposed. 
e.  Awnings with signage included should always be externally illuminated. 
5.  Styles of illumination. 
a.  Halo-style internal illumination-This form of internal illumination directs light to the wall behind the sign that results in a halo of light around the opaque lettering or logo. 

b.  Stencil-cut internal illumination (freestanding sign)-This form restricts the illuminated portions of the sign to the lettering or logo. The remaining face of the sign is opaque. Stencil-cut creates a sign that prevents the background of the sign from being illuminated. Only the logo and name of the brand would illuminate. 

c.  Channel-letters internal illumination-This style of sign is comprised of individual letters and symbols, each with its own internal illumination. 

d.  Push-through graphics and text-A mix between stencil-cut and channel-letters, where an opaque background like a stencil-cut, but has raised lettering or images that act similarly to channel-letters. 

6.  Preferred external illumination standards. 
a.  Goose-neck lighting-This form of external illumination consists of lamps that hang over the sign, where the lamps are an attractive architectural component of the building. 

b.  Spot or ground external lighting-This is a method of illumination where the source is shielded from public and is not an architectural component of the building or sign. 

c.  Direct lighting-Any method of external illumination where a light source is directed at a sign, and is adequately shielded to prevent light pollution on neighboring properties. 
I.  Unlawful cutting of trees and shrubs. No person may for the purpose of increasing or enhancing the visibility of any sign, damage, trim, destroy or remove any trees, shrubs or other vegetation located: 
1.  Within right-of-way of any public street or road, unless the work is done pursuant to any approved site or grading plan; 
2.  On property that is not under the ownership or control of the person doing or responsible for such work, unless the work is done pursuant to the express written authorization of the owner of the property where the trees and/or shrubs are located; or 
3.  In any area where such trees or shrubs are required to remain pursuant to an approved site plan, grading plan or plat. 
J.  Signs on undeveloped/vacant property. Signs on undeveloped/vacant property may be used for any purpose permitted by this ordinance. For the purposes of this requirement, a property is considered "developed" when it contains a permitted active principal use. Rights-of-way, fee simple land, and/or easements used for utilities, roads, railroads, and similar uses are considered "Undeveloped/Vacant property" and may not contain any type of changeable copy signs. 
K.  Municipal information signs. 
1.  The City of Mt. Juliet may install within public City rights-of-way municipal information signs. Such signs shall: 
a.  Provide directions only to locations within the corporate limits or urban growth boundary of the city; 
b.  Conform to the materials and construction standards established by the City; 
c.  Conform to standards set by the commission with their number, location and content. 
2.  The City of Mt. Juliet may install and/or authorize the placement of signs with non-commercial messages within the public City rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 2016-30, § 1(Exh. A), 6-13-2016; Ord. No. 2017-29, § 1, 5-8-2017; Ord. No. 2018-28, § 1, 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 11-104. - Construction and maintenance. 
A.  Code compliance. All signs shall comply with the applicable provisions of the current Building and the Electrical Codes as adopted by ordinance of the City of Mt. Juliet at all times. 
B.  Permanent installation required. Except for permitted flags, temporary banners/signs, and window signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this ordinance, all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame or structure. 
C.  Maintenance. All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, in compliance with all building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this section, at all times. Specifically: 
1.  A sign shall have no more than 20 percent of its surface area covered with disfigured, cracked, ripped/peeling paint, or other material for a period of no more than 30 days. 
2.  A sign shall not stand with bent or broken sign facing, with broken supports, with loose appendages or struts, or more than 15 degrees from vertical for a period of no more than 30 successive days. 
3.  A sign shall not have weeds, trees, vines, bird nests or other vegetation growing upon it, or obscuring the view of the sign from the street or right-of-way from which it is to be viewed for a period of no more than 30 successive days. 
4.  An internally illuminated sign shall be allowed to stand with only partial illumination for a period of no more than 30 successive days. 
5.  Damaged and/or deteriorated signs shall be restored within 60 days or removed in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. 
(Ord. No. 2016-30, § 1(Exh. A), 6-13-2016)

ARTICLE XII. - ENVIRONMENTAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 

Sec. 12-101. - Environmental performance standards. 
    12-101.1 Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish development standards for environmentally sensitive land areas, in a manner that provides for reasonable use of land while retaining to the maximum extent possible environmentally sensitive portions in a predeveloped state. These provisions are predicated on the concept that land use policy decisions are made in the context of land characteristics. Optimally, these characteristics include all physical as well as locational characteristics of a development site. The requirements and standards of this section are intended to promote low-impact development of identified environmentally sensitive areas by the use of incentives aimed at minimizing environmental disturbance. 
    12-101.2 Applicability. The provisions of this section are applicable to the following environmentally sensitive lands: 
1.  Steep hillsides. The hillside development standards apply to predevelopment conditions for new development on steep slopes. 
2.  Special flood hazard areas. The floodplain development standards apply to predevelopment conditions for new development within "areas of special flood hazard" identified in article VIII of this ordinance. 
3.  Problem soil areas. The problem soils development standards apply to predevelopment conditions for new development located within the listed soil types as identified in the Wilson County Soil Survey (USDA, Soil Conservation Service). The groundwater protection standards developed herein shall apply to any lot not served by public water and/or sewer. 
4.  Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the following: 
a.  Any construction, development or use initiated pursuant to any valid building permit or approved final site development plan issued or approved prior to adoption of this ordinance. 
b.  Any essential public utility facility, system or roadway initiated to provide utility services or access to a property. 
c.  Repair or replacement to an existing structure or building that does not increase the impervious surface area of the site more than 25 percent. 
d.  Construction of a single-family or duplex dwelling on a lot which was platted and recorded at the time of adoption of this ordinance. 
    12-101.3 Variable lot size option. Within development sites that contain steep slopes, areas subject to flooding or problem soils the clustering of residential lots on portions of a development site that are not subject to such problems is strongly encouraged. Within such developments, the provisions of article V, subsection 5-104.3, Variable lot residential development, shall apply. Portions of the development site within variable lot size developments that contain slopes of 20 percent or greater, are subject to flooding or are identified as wetlands shall be retained as open space.

    12-105.9 Nonconforming by reason of operational performance standards. Any use existing on the effective date of this ordinance, or subsequent amendment as applicable and permitted by right that does not meet the requirements of one or more of the operational performance standards established explicitly in this section or by reference shall be subject to the provisions of article XIII, subsection 13-102.11, Special provisions pertaining to uses not conforming to performance standards. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 12-105) 
ARTICLE XIII. - PROVISIONS GOVERNING NONCONFORMING USES AND NONCOMPLYING BUILDINGS OR OTHER STRUCTURES 

Sec. 13-101. - Statement of purpose. 
    The districts established in this ordinance (as set forth in district regulations, in articles V through XII) are designed to guide the future use of land in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, by encouraging the development of desirable residential, commercial and industrial areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
    As a necessary corollary, in order to carry out such purposes, nonconforming uses of land that adversely affect the development of such areas must be subject to certain limitations. The provisions governing nonconforming uses set forth in this article are, therefore, established to contain the existing undesirable conditions resulting from such incompatible nonconforming uses, which are detrimental to the achievement of such purposes. While such uses are generally permitted to continue, this ordinance is designed to restrict any expansion of such uses beyond the site which the use occupied upon the effective date of this ordinance. 
    In the case of buildings or other structures not complying with the bulk regulations or open space provisions of this ordinance, the provisions governing noncomplying buildings or other structures set forth in this article are established in order to permit the continued use of such buildings or other structures, but to limit the creation of additional noncompliance or increase in the degree of noncompliance. 
    These provisions are thus designed to preserve the character of the districts established in this ordinance in light of their suitability to particular uses, and thus to promote the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 13-101) 
Sec. 13-102. - Provisions governing nonconforming uses. 
    13-102.1 Applicability. The provisions of this section are applicable to all uses which are not permitted within the districts in which they are located. Additionally, buildings and other structures located within the floodplain are considered within the regulation of nonconforming uses. 
    13-102.2 Construction or use permit approved prior to ordinance adoption. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall layout, plans, construction, site or designated use of any development, building, structure, or part thereof where official approvals and required building permits have been granted before the enactment of this ordinance, or any amendment thereto, the construction of which, conforming with such plans, shall have been started prior to the effective date of this ordinance and completion thereof carried on in a normal manner within the subsequent six months period, and not discontinued until completion except for reasons beyond the builder's control. In the event that the activity or construction of such building or other structures is not substantially underway and being diligently pursued within the six-month period following issuance of a building permit, then such permit shall automatically lapse and the provisions of this ordinance shall apply. 
    13-102.3 Conditional use; status and alteration. Whenever the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of adoption of the zoning ordinance has authorized any use which is not permitted as of right by issuing a variance, exception, or permit to locate in a district, such authorization may be continued subject to the time of approval of said variance, exception, or conditional use permit, including any time period established for the continuation of such use. However, any change of use, alteration or expansion is subject to the provisions of this ordinance. 
    13-102.4 Repairs and alterations. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by proper authority. 
    13-102.5 Continuation of nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use which existed lawfully at the time of enactment of this ordinance and which remains nonconforming under the provisions contained herein or any use which shall become nonconforming upon enactment of this ordinance, or any subsequent amendments thereto, may be allowed to continue in operation and be permitted provided that no change in use (see subsection 13-102.6 of this section) is undertaken. 
    13-102.6 Change of nonconforming use. 
1.  General provisions. For the purpose of this article, a change in use is a change to another use either under the same activity type or any other activity type or major class of activity; however, a change in occupancy or ownership shall not, by itself, constitute a change of use. A nonconforming use may be changed to any conforming use, and the applicable bulk regulations and accessory off-street parking requirements shall apply to such change of use or to alterations made in order to accommodate such conforming use. 
2.  Land with incidental improvements. In all districts, a nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall be changed only to a conforming use. 
3.  Nonconforming to conforming use. Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use. 
    13-102.7 Expansion of nonconforming uses. Any use which shall become nonconforming upon enactment of this ordinance, or any subsequent amendments thereto, may be allowed to expand operations and construct additional facilities which involve an actual continuance and expansion of the nonconforming use provided that any such expansion shall not violate the provisions set out below. 
1.  Land with incidental improvements. In all districts, a nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be allowed to expand through the addition of buildings or other structures. 
2.  Adequate space for expansion. No expansion or any nonconforming use shall infringe upon, or increase the extent of any infringement existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance, upon any open space required by this ordinance. 
3.  Application of other provisions to expanded facilities. In the event that any proposed expansion or addition is valued at less than 50 percent of the assessed valuation (as recorded on the most current edition of the property tax records) of the improvements located upon the site, all provisions of this ordinance other than those which would act to eliminate the use of the property, shall be applicable to the expansion or addition. In the event, however, that the proposed expansion or addition is valued at 50 percent or more of the assessed valuation of the improvements located upon the site, all provisions of this ordinance other than those which would act to eliminate the use of the property, shall apply both to the existing facilities, as well as the expansion or addition. 
4.  Expansion limited. Any expansion of a nonconforming use permitted under the provisions of this article shall take place only upon the zone lot(s) on which said use was operating at the time the use became nonconforming. Nothing within this provision shall be construed so as to permit expansion of any nonconforming use through the acquisition and development of additional land. Where parking, open space or other provisions of this ordinance may so require, future expansions or additions shall be limited to that which can be accommodated without creating any new noncompliance. 
5.  Expansion upon land subject to flood. No expansion of any nonconforming use shall violate the provisions of subsection 13-102.10, Special provisions governing nonconforming buildings within floodplain districts. 
    13-102.8 Damage or destruction. Any use which shall become nonconforming upon enactment of this ordinance, or any subsequent amendments thereto, may be permitted to reconstruct damaged or destroyed facilities which involve an actual continuance of the nonconforming use provided that any such reconstruction shall not violate the provisions set out below. 
1.  Change in use prohibited. No reconstruction of damaged or destroyed facilities may occur which shall act to change the nonconforming use (as regulated in subsection 13-102.6, above) to other than a permitted use. 
2.  Land with incidental improvements. In all districts, when a nonconforming building or other structure or improvements located on "land with incidental improvements" (as defined by this ordinance) is damaged or destroyed to the extent of 25 percent or more of the assessed valuation of all buildings, and other structures or other improvements located thereon (as determined from the assessment rolls effective on the date of damage or destruction), such nonconforming use shall terminate and the tract of land shall, thereafter, be used only for a conforming use. 
3.  Infringement upon open space restricted. No reconstruction of damaged or destroyed facilities utilized by a nonconforming use shall increase the extent of any infringement upon any open space required by this ordinance. 
4.  Damage or destruction of buildings or other structures. In all districts, when any building or other structure which is substantially occupied by a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50 percent or more of the assessed valuation (as recorded on the most current edition of the property tax records) of the improvements located upon the site, such building or other structure may be reconstructed provided that no such action shall increase the extent of any infringement upon any open space required by this ordinance and that the reconstructed buildings, structures and other site improvements, shall comply as fully as possible with all other provisions of this ordinance. When the extent of damage or destruction is less than 50 percent of the assessed valuation of the improvements, the nonconforming use may be continued and the buildings or other structures may be restored provided that: 
a.  A building permit pertaining to such restoration is applied for and issued within one year of such damage or destruction. 
b.  A certificate of zoning compliance is issued within one year after the issuance of the building permit. 
c.  Such restoration shall not cause a new nonconformance nor increase the degree of nonconformance or noncompliance existing prior to such damage or destruction. Otherwise, the nonconforming use shall be deemed to have ceased active operation and the provisions of subsection 13-102.9 shall apply. 
5.  Reconstruction of flood damaged property. The provisions of subsection 13-102.10, Special provisions governing nonconforming buildings within floodplain districts, shall apply to the reconstruction of all buildings and structures associated with any nonconforming use located within the F-1, Floodplain District. 
    13-102.9 Discontinuance. When a nonconforming use of land or the active operation of substantially all the nonconforming uses in any building or other structure or tract of land is discontinued for a period of one year, then the land or building or other structure shall thereafter be used only for a conforming use. Intent to resume active operations shall not affect the foregoing provision. 
    13-102.10 Special provisions governing nonconforming buildings within floodplain districts. 
1.  General provisions. In all districts or portions, thereof, which extend into the F-1, Floodplain Districts as established by section 8-301, any building or other structure or use which is not permitted by the floodplain district provisions shall become nonconforming upon the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment as applicable. 
2.  Enlargement of buildings within the floodplain. A building or other structure which is nonconforming by reason of location within the floodplain shall not be enlarged or expanded, but may be altered, or repaired as set forth in subsection 13-102.4, or as may be expressly authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals in order to incorporate floodproofing measures provided that such alteration will not increase the level of the 100-year flood. 
3.  Special provisions governing reconstruction of buildings or structures located within floodway districts. Within any designated floodway district, any building or structure in existence prior to the effective date of this ordinance that is, hereafter, destroyed or substantially damaged by any means may be reconstructed and used as before, only if the following requirements are met: 
a.  The reconstruction does not exceed the volume and external dimensions of the original structure or does not offer any greater obstruction to the flow of floodwaters than did the original structure. 
b.  Nonresidential structures may be reconstructed only if the lowest floor (including basement) elevation is at least one foot above the level of the 100-year flood or the structure is floodproofed (in accordance with the requirements of article VIII, section 8-304) to a height of at least one foot above the level of the 100-year flood. 
c.  Residential structures may be reconstructed only if the lowest floor (including basement) of the structure is elevated to a point at least one foot above the level of the 100-year flood. 
d.  That no reconstruction or alteration permitted, hereinunder, shall result in any increase in the level of the 100-year flood. 
    13-102.11 Special provisions pertaining to uses not conforming to performance standards. 
1.  Conformance of lawful uses to applicable performance standards. In all districts, any lawful use which does not conform to one or more applicable performance standards established in article XII, may be continued for a period of ten years from the effective date of the ordinance or subsequent amendment. After ten years and six months notice by the Zoning Administrator, it shall conform to all applicable performance standards. 
2.  Conformance of nonconforming uses to applicable performance standards. In all districts where there is any use which is not a permitted use, and where there are performance standards which are applicable in the districts in which it would be permitted, but not in the district in which it is located, the use may be continued, but it shall conform to the performance standards in that district where it is a permitted use in which the most stringent performance standards apply after five years and six months notice by the Zoning Administrator. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 13-102) 
Sec. 13-103. - Noncomplying buildings or other structures. 
    13-103.1 General provisions. The provisions of this section shall control buildings and other structures which do not meet the bulk or any other provisions applicable in the districts in which they are located, except those provisions which pertain to activity or use. 
    13-103.2 Continuation of use. The use of a noncomplying building or other structure or parcel may be continued, except as, otherwise, provided by this section. 
    13-103.3 Repairs and alterations. Repairs, incidental alterations, or structural alterations may be made in noncomplying buildings or other structures subject to the provisions of subsection 13-103.4, Enlargement of conversion. 
    13-103.4 Enlargement of conversion. 
1.  Adequate space for expansion. No expansion or enlargement of any noncomplying building or other structure may be made which would either create a new noncompliance or increase the degree of any previously existing noncompliance of any building or other structure or parcel or portion, thereof. 
2.  Buildings noncomplying as to lot area. If a building does not comply with the applicable district regulations on lot area per dwelling unit (lot area of zone lot being smaller than required for the number of dwelling units on such zone lot) such building may be converted (and, in mixed buildings, the residential use may be extended, except when in the floodplain district) provided that the deficiency in the required lot area is not, thereby, increased (for example, a noncomplying building on a zone lot of 3,500 square feet, which before conversion required a lot area of 5,000 square feet and was, therefore, deficient by 1,500 square feet, can be converted into any combination of dwelling units requiring a lot area of no more than 5,000 square feet). 
3.  Application of other provisions to expanded facilities. In the event that any proposed expansion or addition to a noncomplying building or structure is valued at less than 50 percent of the assessed valuation (as recorded on the most current edition of the property tax records) of the improvements located upon the site, all provisions of this ordinance shall be applicable to the expansion or addition. In the event, however, that the proposed expansion or addition is valued at 50 percent or more of the assessed valuation of the improvements located upon the site all provisions of this ordinance shall apply to both the existing facilities, with the exception of any preexisting noncomplying conditions and the expansion or addition. 
    13-103.5 Damage or destruction of noncomplying buildings and other structures. In all districts, when any noncomplying building or other structure is damaged or destroyed such building or other structures may be restored provided that such restoration shall not cause a new noncompliance nor increase the degree of noncompliance existing prior to such damage or destruction. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 13-103) 
Sec. 13-104. - Substandard residential lots. 
    Within all districts where residential uses are authorized, a single-family dwelling may be built upon a lot which was of record upon the date of adoption of this ordinance, provided such lot contains a minimum total lot area of 5,000 square feet. 
(Ord. No. 2007-21, 5-29-2007; Ord. No. 2009-23, 5-11-2009; Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 13-101) 
ARTICLE XIV. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 14-101. - Appointment and duties of the zoning administrator.

1.  Interpretation and administration. The Zoning Administrator shall interpret and administer the provisions of this ordinance; 
2.  Use and occupancy permits and certificates of compliance. The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to issue use and occupancy permits, to certify zoning compliance, to stop work that has commenced without obtaining a required zoning permit, and to impose additional fees for required permits when work has commenced or occupancy occurs without obtaining a required zoning permit. In any instance, however, where a site plan is required by provisions of this ordinance no final use and occupancy permit shall be issued until a certificate of compliance is issued by the Zoning Administrator; 
3.  Enforcement of this ordinance. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for enforcing all provisions of this ordinance; 
4.  Information and advisement. The Zoning Administrator shall provide information to the public on all matters relating to this ordinance; 
5.  Maintain records. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain permanent and current records of this ordinance and subsequent amendments, including, but not limited to, all maps, amendments, conditional uses, variations, appeals and applications, therefor; and 
6.  Right of entry. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to enter upon any land within the jurisdiction of this ordinance for purposes of making examinations and surveys, conducting inspections of buildings, structures and use of land to determine compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and to place or remove public notices as required by this ordinance. 
    14-101.3 Powers of the zoning administrator regarding enforcement of performance standards. When the Zoning Administrator has reason to believe that there is a violation of applicable performance standards, he may issue notice specifying the nature of the alleged violation and demanding that it be corrected. The Zoning Administrator may engage appropriate governmental agencies or other experts to perform tests to determine the existence and extent of the violation. Where other experts are employed and a violation is verified, the owner of the use shall pay all test costs and correct the violation. In any instance where such fees are not paid, the City may withhold issuance of any use and occupancy permits and/or create a lien on the subject property. If the owner does not correct the violation within a reasonable time, the Zoning Administrator may proceed to enforce as with any other violation.

    14-101.5 Duties of the Zoning Administrator in enforcing floodplain district regulations. In the enforcement of the provisions of article VIII, sections 8-301 through 8-305, Floodplain district regulations, the Zoning Administrator or his designated representative shall: 
1.  Review all development permits to ensure that the requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied, and that proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
2.  Advise permittees that additional federal or state permits may be required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements are known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the development permit. This shall include section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments, of 1972, 33 USC 1334. 
3.  Notify adjacent communities, the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, Local Planning Assistance Office and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
4.  Ensure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
5.  Verify and record as the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved buildings. 
6.  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved buildings and all mechanical and electrical equipment have been floodproofed. 
7.  When floodproofing is utilized for a particular building, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain certification from a registered professional engineer or architect. 
8.  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation of the flood maps. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article. 
9.  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided, then the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, including data developed as a result of these regulations, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements or other development in zone A, on the community FHBM or FIRM, meet the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2007-21, 5-29-2007; Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 14-101) 
Sec. 14-102. - Zoning permits. 
    14-102.1 Permits required. The permits indicated within this section are required before any site grading or construction activity of any type is initiated upon any zone lot or parcel of land or before extending or changing to another activity type on any zone lot. Except as hereinafter provided, no permit pertaining to the use of land or buildings shall be issued by any officer, department, or employee of the City, unless the application for such permit has been examined by the office of the Zoning Administrator and a determination made by that office that the proposed building or activity complies with all provisions of this ordinance. Any building permit or any other permit issued in conflict with this provision or any other provision of this ordinance shall be null and void. 
1.  Application. An application for a zoning permit shall include all information and exhibits necessary to determine if the proposed activity and/or development is in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. The following zoning permits are required subject to the specific provisions of the referenced sections: 
Permit Applicable Provision Grading permit [Sub]section 14-102.2 Site utilization and reclamation permit [Sub]section 14-102.3 Foundation permit [Sub]section 14-102.4 Building permit [Sub]section 14-102.5 Use and occupancy permits [Sub]section 14-102.6  
    14-102.2 Grading permits. In any instance where no building or construction activity is to take place upon a site a grading permit may be issued by the City Engineer, provided that a tree inventory and protection plan meeting the requirements for such set out in article X, has been approved and the applicant has demonstrated that the use or activity will comply with all provisions of this ordinance. 
    14-102.3 Site utilization and reclamation permits. Site utilization and reclamation permits are required for any mining and quarrying uses and for the removal or stripping of topsoil in excess of 10,000 square feet of land area; the excavation or placement of fill material in excess of 100 cubic yards; or any excavation or placement of fill material which would infringe upon a drainageway, floodplain or wetland area as determined by the City Engineer. This section expressly exempts excavation or fill for the purpose of constructing a swimming pool, basement, garage or similar use which is deemed to be an accessory structure to a principal residential building or minor grading one foot or less in depth done for purposes of constructing a one- or two-family dwelling. 
    14-102.4 Foundation permits. In any instance where building or construction activity is proposed to take place upon a site, a building permit may be issued upon approval of a grading plan (as specified in subsection 14-103.3, of this article). Such permit may be limited to preliminary site grading and construction of the foundation only. 
    14-102.5 Building permits. Upon approval of a plot plan or site plan as specified in subsections 14-103.1 or 14-103.2, a building permit for such use may be issued. A grading permit or building permit (limited to preliminary site grading and foundation construction) may be issued prior to the issuance of a building permit with an approved site plan or a site utilization and reclamation plan forming the basis for such action. 
    14-102.6 Use and occupancy permit. All buildings, excluding one- and two-family dwelling units, which are constructed after the effective date of this ordinance or are to be occupied by any commercial, industrial, multifamily residential or community facilities activity, and all additions to previously existing buildings to be similarly utilized or occupied and all land uses for such purposes shall be subject to this provision. A use and occupancy permit shall be obtained as provided herein prior to occupancy of the building or land area. No change in a use to a use or activity of a different type or class shall take place until a use and occupancy permit has been obtained. 
1.  Permits for use and occupancy where no building permit is required. No land heretofore vacant shall hereafter be used or an existing use of land be hereafter changed to a use or activity of a different class or type, unless a use and occupancy permit is first obtained for the new or different use. Every application for a use and occupancy permit for a new use of land where no building permit is required shall be made directly to the office of the Zoning Administrator. 
2.  Application to be accompanied by certified final site plans. Any application for a use and occupancy permit involving any development for which a site plan is required by the provisions of subsection 14-103.2 of this article, shall be accompanied by the completed site certification required by subpart 5, of subsection 14-103.5 and/or a performance bond as provided in subsection 14-103.7. 
3.  Permits not to be issued. No use and occupancy permit shall be issued for any building, structure or part thereof, or for the use of land, which is not in accordance with all provisions of this ordinance. In all instances where a site plan is required in accordance with the provisions of subsection 14-103.2, no final use and occupancy permit shall be issued until a final development review has been conducted and the development has been found to be in full compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
4.  Permits for initial occupancy of new buildings. No new building shall be occupied nor any use of the land commenced before either a temporary use and occupancy permit or a permanent use and occupancy permit has been issued therefor. Provided, however, that no permanent use and occupancy permit shall be issued for any use until a final development review has been conducted and the development has been found to be in full compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. In any instance where the Zoning Administrator determines that due to the season of the year planting of landscape materials would not be desirable, a permanent use and occupancy permit may be issued provided that a performance bond is established for the uncompleted portion of the landscaping as provided in subsection 14-103.7 and a maintenance surety is established as required by subsection 14-103.8. 
5.  Temporary use and occupancy permits. In any instance where a site plan has been approved and site improvements have been bonded as provided in subsection 14-103.8, a temporary use and occupancy permit may be issued for all or a portion of the development. No temporary use and occupancy permit may be issued until the building or portion thereof for which the request is made has been determined to meet all safety codes. 
(Ord. of 10-23-2009, § 14-102) 
Sec. 14-103. - Required plans. 
    The following plans and procedures for approval thereof are required for the uses indicated: 
14-103.1 Plot plan required for one- and two-family dwellings.

14-105.4 Standards for variances. The Board shall not grant a variance, unless it makes findings based upon evidence presented to it as follows: 
1.  By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a particular piece of property at the time of enactment of this ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other exceptional and extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, the strict application of any regulation contained within this ordinance would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional or undue hardship upon the owner of such property.

3.  The variance will not authorize activities in a zone district other than those permitted by this ordinance. 
4.  Financial returns only shall not be considered as a basis for granting a variance. 
5.  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare, injurious to other property or improvements in the area in which the subject property is located, or a substantial impairment to the intent and purpose of the zoning district wherein such property is located or of the general provisions of this ordinance. 
6.  The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to the adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety.

1.  Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
2.  Standards to be applied. In its consideration of any variance from the provisions of the floodplain district regulations the Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and:

The following conditions shall apply to any variance which may be approved by the Board: 
a.  Variances may be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary, considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(i)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and that such construction below the base flood level increase risks to life and property. 
d.  The Zoning Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

Sec. IV. - Materials specification and construction procedures. 
A.  Preliminary Work. 
1.  Location and Protection of Underground Utilities. Prior to beginning excavation or grading, the subdivider shall determine, insofar as possible, the actual locations of all underground utilities in the vicinity of his operations and shall clearly mark them so that they can be avoided by equipment operators. Where such utility lines or services appear to lie in the path of construction, they shall be uncovered in advance to determine their exact location and depth and to avoid damage due to excavation or grading operations. Existing facilities shall be protected during construction or removed and replaced in equal condition, as necessary. 
Should any existing utility line or service be damaged during or as a result of the subdivider's operations, the subdivider shall take such emergency measures as may be necessary to minimize damage and shall immediately notify the utility agency involved. The subdivider shall then repair the damage to the satisfaction of the utility agency or shall pay the utility agency for making the repairs. In all cases the damaged structure shall be in as good or better condition as before the damage occurred. 
2.  Surveying and Staking. The subdivider shall be responsible for his own surveys and establish his own grades unless otherwise directed by the enforcing officer. 
3.  Removal of Obstructions. The subdivider shall be responsible for the removal, safeguarding, and replacement of fences, walls, structures, culverts, street signs, billboards, shrubs, mailboxes, or other obstructions which must be moved to facilitate construction. Such obstructions shall be restored to at least their original condition. 
4.  Clearing and Grubbing. The subdivider shall be responsible for cutting, removing, and disposing of all trees, brush, stumps, roots, and weeds within the construction area. Disposal shall be by means of chippers, landfills, or other approved methods not in conflict with state or local ordinances. 
Care shall be taken to avoid unnecessary cutting or damage to trees not in the construction area. The subdivider shall be responsible for loss or damage to trees outside the permanent easement or rights-of-way. 
5.  Traffic Control and Safety. The subdivider shall provide and maintain access to and from all properties along the line of his work. The subdivider shall also provide temporary bypasses and bridges where necessary to route traffic and shall maintain them in a safe and usable condition whenever, in the opinion of the enforcing officer, detouring of traffic to parallel routes cannot be done without hardship or excessive increase in travel by the public. 
Where single-lane bypasses are provided the subdivider shall furnish signalmen to control traffic operations and minimize delays. 
The subdivider shall provide, erect, and maintain adequate barricades, warning signs, and lights at all excavations, closures, detours, points of danger, and uncompleted pavement. 
B.  Roadway construction. 
1.  Stripping, Stockpiling, and Placing Topsoil. All topsoil shall be stripped within the street right-of-way and from any other area designated by the enforcing officer. Topsoil shall be stored in stockpiles. All organic matter within the right-of-way shall be stripped and disposed of unless directed otherwise by the enforcing officer. 
A two or three inch layer of topsoil shall be placed where seeding is required or where required by the enforcing officer. 
After the stockpiled topsoil has been placed as specified above, the area where the topsoil was stockpiled shall be neatly graded and dressed. 
2.  Excavation. Excavation shall conform to limits indicated on the plans. Excavation materials shall be removed in such manner that the slopes can be neatly trimmed. Excavation shall not be made below grade except where rock or stone masonry is encountered or undercutting of unstable materials is required. Materials removed below grade shall be replaced with approved materials thoroughly compacted. Where borrow materials are required to complete embankments or fills the subdivider shall be responsible for providing them. 
Rock excavation shall be removed to a minimum depth of 12 inches below the subgrade and backfilled with approved materials which shall be thoroughly compacted. 
Where a spring or seepage water is encountered that is not provided for on drainage plans it shall be reported to the enforcing officer. 
3.  Fills and Embankments. Embankment and fill materials shall be free from frost, stumps, trees, roots, sod, or muck. Only materials from excavation or borrow pits, or other materials approved by the enforcing officer shall be used. Materials shall not be placed on frozen ground. 
Where excavated materials are used in fill construction and the materials consist of earth and various grades of rock, the fills shall be carefully constructed with the larger or hard rock on the bottom followed by the smaller or soft rock and finally the earth fill to provide a well-compacted and void-free embankment. 
All depressions or holes below the natural ground surface, whether caused by grubbing, rock removal, undercutting, or otherwise, shall be filled with suitable materials and compacted to ground surface before fill construction is started. 
Backfilling around a structure shall have been completed and thoroughly compacted to ground surface before any embankment materials are placed thereon. 
Embankments shall be so constructed that adequate surface drainage will be provided at all times. 
Fill areas shall be compacted by a sheep's foot roller, to a density of not less than 95 percent of optimum density and within three percent of optimum moisture content per ASTM D 698, and each lift of fill materials shall be rolled until the roller "walk out". 
Fill materials shall be placed in eight inch lifts, maximum thickness. Where excavated materials consist mainly of rock too large to be placed in the normal eight inch thickness without crushing or further breaking down the pieces, such materials shall be placed in the fill in layers not exceeding three feet in depth. No rock larger than 18 inches in dimension shall be placed in fill. Care shall be taken to fill all voids between large rock and to assure that fill materials are compacted such that [text missing from original ordinance] of the top six inches of cuts or fills shall be accomplished with pneumatic-tire rollers. 
Backfill around structures shall be of crushed stone or earth meeting the approval of the enforcing officer; and the fill shall be placed and compacted in eight inch lifts and brought up evenly on all sides of the structure. 
4.  Undercutting. This work shall consist of the removal and disposal of unsatisfactory materials below grade in cut sections or areas upon which embankments are to be placed. It shall also include undercutting for pipes and box culverts where required. 
Known areas to be undercut shall be designated on the materials approved by the enforcing officer. The backfill materials shall be placed in eight inch lifts and compacted as specified for fill construction. 
Disposal of unsatisfactory materials shall be approved by the enforcing officer. 
5.  Subgrade Construction and Preparation. The subgrade shall be prepared in reasonably close conformity with the lines and grades as shown on the plans. 
Grading of subgrade shall be performed in such manner as to provide ready drainage of water. Ditches and drains shall be maintained to provide proper drainage during construction. 
Hauling over finished subgrade shall be limited to that which is essential for construction purposes, and all ruts or rough places that develop in a completed subgrade shall be smoothed and recompacted. Soft areas shall be removed and replaced with crushed stone or as directed by the enforcing officer. 
The subgrade shall be checked and approved by the enforcing officer for adherence to the plans before any base materials are placed. 
6.  Shoulders and Slopes. All shoulders and slopes shall be trimmed and shaped to conform with the cross sections shown on the plans and as specified in Section C-5, below. Rock cuts shall be sealed of all loose fragments, projecting points, etc., so as to leave a clean and neat appearance. Shoulders shall be completed where required as shown on the plans and shall be double bituminous surface treated, with care being taken to protect the surface and edges of pavement. Shoulder materials shall be placed in uniform layers and compacted by overlapped rolling of both base course and pavement. The finished shoulder shall be firm against the pavement. 
C.  Base and paving. 
1.  Base Stone. After the subbase has been inspected and approved by the City Engineer, a base shall be constructed of the width and thickness indicated in the selected roadway cross-section. 
The base course of stone shall be placed and compacted in layers or lifts upon the prepared subgrade to a finish thickness as described and shown on the plans. No single layer or lift shall exceed six inches in depth. 
The base course shall be a mix of mineral aggregate conforming to the technical specifications set forth in Section 303, Standard Specifications. 
The aggregate base shall not be spread on a subgrade that is frozen or that contains frost. The base shall be placed and spread in uniform layers or lifts without segregation of size; each layer shall be compacted to a thickness no greater than four inches. The stone shall be mixed with graders or other equipment until a uniform mixture is obtained. Each layer shall be compacted by rolling with alternate blading until a smooth, even, and uniformly compacted finish is obtained. 
The base stone shall be graded and rolled while it is still moist from the pugmill mix. If the enforcing officer determines that the mix is too dry, water shall be added with a distributor tank truck while the stone is being graded and rolled. Compaction shall be uniform for the entire width of the roadway until a density of 80 percent of the solid volume has been achieved. Placement and compaction of each layer shall be approved by the enforcing officer before materials for the next successive layer are placed. 
No pavement shall be placed until the stone base has been approved by the City Engineer. 
2.  Prime Coat. After the base stone has been prepared as outlined above, a bituminous prime coat shall be applied uniformly over the surface of the base by the use of an approved bituminous distributor. The prime coat shall be applied at the rate of the three-tenths gallon per square yard, using Grade RC-70 or RC-250, or refined tar Grade RT-2, RT-3, or emulsified asphalt, Grade AE-P. If, after the bituminous materials have been applied, they fail to penetrate before the time that the roadway is to be used by traffic, dry cover materials shall be spread at a rate established by the enforcing officer, (between eight and 12 pounds per square yard) to prevent damage to the primed surface. An excess of cover materials shall be avoided. No succeeding state of construction shall be placed upon the prime coat until it has properly cured. Aggregate for cover materials shall be Size No. 78 or 8. 
In addition to these general requirements, unless otherwise stipulated, all materials and methods of installation shall conform to the technical specifications set forth in Section 402, Standard Specifications. 
3.  Tack Coat. A tack coat shall be applied to old or existing pavement surface or to a previously prepared base or surface to provide bond for an overlaid course. The tack coat shall be applied at the rate of one-tenth gallon per square yard using materials and methods of installation set forth in Section 403, Standard Specifications. 
4.  Asphalt Base Mix. Upon completion of the application of the prime coat, or tack coat, an asphaltic concrete (hot mix) base shall be applied. The base mix shall be the thickness shown on the detail sheet for that class street. All materials and methods of installation shall conform to the technical specifications set forth in Section 307 and Section 407, Standard Specifications. The base mix shall be constructed of Grade BM (B-modified) materials, described in Section 903.06, Standard Specifications. 
Suitably sized samples for the determination of thickness and density of the completed pavement may be removed and tested, as directed by the City Engineer. The contractor shall replace without cost where samples are removed. If the deficiency in composition, density and thickness exceeds the requirements specified, they shall be removed and replaced by the contractor. Only materials that have been demonstrated by test as satisfactory for the intended use will be accepted. 
5.  Asphaltic Wearing Surface. The final asphalt wearing surface shall not be placed until a minimum of 75 percent of the residences served by the street are complete, any potholes in the binder have been repaired, the binder has been leveled, and where curbs are provided, the backfill behind such placed and compacted. 
Upon approval of the City Engineer the final wearing surface may be applied. The wearing surface shall be the thickness shown on the detail sheet for that class street. All materials and methods of installation shall conform to the technical specifications set forth in Section 411, Standard Specifications, for asphaltic concrete surface. The wearing surface shall be constructed of Grade D or E materials, described in Section 903.11, Standard Specifications, and shall utilize asphaltic cement Grade RT-4 or 5, or TRCB-5 or 6, as set forth in Section 904, Standard Specifications. 
Suitably sized samples for the determination of thickness and density of the completed pavement may be removed and tested, as directed by the City Engineer. The contractor shall replace without cost where samples are removed. If the deficiency in composition, density and thickness exceeds the requirements specified, they shall be removed and replaced by the contractor. Only materials that have been demonstrated by test as satisfactory for the intended use will be accepted. 
6.  Shoulders. Shoulder construction shall be completed by blading, moistening as necessary, and by thoroughly compacting. The shoulders shall be the width and thickness shown on the typical section as required herein and covered with a double bituminous service treatment. The surface shall be prepared as directed in advance of the surface construction. Upon completion of the prime coat, a double bituminous surface treatment shall be applied with the first course being at a rate of between 0.38 and 0.42 gallons per square yard. If the width of application is wider than the distributor, each width of spread shall not be less than one-half the surface to be treated. Areas inaccessible to the distributor shall be treated either with hand sprays or pouring pots. Immediately after each application of bituminous materials has been made, it shall be covered uniformly with Size No. 6, mineral aggregate. The aggregate shall be allowed to cure for a length of time to be determined by the chief enforcing officer before the second application is begun. 
The second application of bituminous materials shall be applied in the same manner as the first application, at a uniform rate of between 0.30 and 0.35 gallons per square yard. Mineral aggregate, Size No. 7, shall then be spread in the same manner as for the first spread at a rate between 20 and 25 pounds per square yard. 
Immediately after each spread of cover aggregate, uniform coverage shall be achieved by hand brooming. Additional aggregate shall be placed by hand on thin or bare areas. 
Immediately after spreading and brooming the cover aggregate, the entire surface shall be rolled, beginning at the edges and progressing to the edge of the pavement. Rolling shall begin within 30 minutes after the aggregate had been spread. The same rolling and curing procedures required in making the first application shall be repeated in making the second application. 
D.  Drainage system design. 
1.  Ditching and Channelization. This work shall consist of the construction of ditches adjacent to roadway shoulders and feeding to and from culverts under or adjacent to the roadway.

CHAPTER 1. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT POLICY 

Sec. 1.1. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of these regulations are: 
1.  To protect human life, health, safety and welfare, MS4 permit compliance, receive no NOVs from TDEC, EPA and COE. 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects. 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
4.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to maximize beneficial use without increasing flood hazard potential or diminishing the quality of the natural stormwater resources. 
5.  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area and generally increase the public awareness of flooding potential. 
6.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
7.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone, and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in floodplains. 
8.  To ensure a functional stormwater quantity and quality management system that will not result in excessive maintenance costs. 
9.  To encourage the use of natural and aesthetically pleasing design that maximizes preservation of natural areas through: (a) the application of low impact design and development and (b) the utilization of site landscaping and vegetation to enhance stormwater management and treatment. 
10.  To guide the construction of stormwater management facilities. 
11.  To protect or enhance stormwater quality to a level of designated use and minimize the impacts from new development or areas of significant redevelopment. 
12.  To encourage preservation of floodplains, floodways and open spaces to protect and benefit the quality of life and natural resources of the community. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 1.2. - Policy statements. 
    To implement the objectives presented above, the following general policy statements shall apply: 
1.  Each project evaluation will determine the nature and extent of stormwater management practices that are necessary to adequately serve the property and limit impacts to downstream public and private properties. The presence of LID, [a] decentralized and a regional facility will be considered in determining the extent to which management practices will be necessary. 
2.  A system of uniform requirements shall be applied to each individual project site. In general, these uniform requirements will be based on the criterion that post-development stormwater peak runoff and water quality and volume impact shall not exceed predevelopment conditions. 
3.  No construction, whether by private or public action, shall be performed in a manner that will negatively impact stormwater quantity or quality in its vicinity or in other areas whether by flow restrictions, increased runoff, or by diminishing channel or overbank storage capacity. 
4.  New construction may not aggravate upstream or downstream flooding. Existing downstream or upstream problems may be required to be corrected in conjunction with new development. 
5.  Unwarranted acceleration of erosion due to various land development activities shall be controlled to the maximum extent possible and/or practical. 
6.  New construction shall not be permitted until temporary or permanent erosion prevention and sedimentation control management practices have been placed or constructed and are operational to the City of Mt. Juliet's satisfaction. Mt. Juliet reserves the right to stop construction on properties that do not have adequate erosion prevention and sedimentation control measures. The "Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook," most current edition, as published by the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, shall provide guidelines for minimum standards for site management of erosion and sedimentation and may be supplemented by policy of the City of Mt. Juliet. 
7.  New development will be required to minimize impact to stormwater quality by applying structural and/or nonstructural management practices selected to address site-specific conditions. 
8.  Mt. Juliet reserves the right to require more stringent erosion prevention and sedimentation control practices on properties within sensitive (or impaired) watersheds proximate to waters of the state or on sites that fail to mitigate ongoing issues. 
9.  Mt. Juliet reserves the rights to require maintenance or modification of stormwater management practices that are not operating properly, as determined by the department of public works. 
10.  For properties where stormwater management practices are not feasible or are not necessary due to the presence of regional stormwater management systems, proximity to a receiving stream, or other determining circumstances, Mt. Juliet reserves the right to require on-site controls for stormwater quality. 
11.  Redevelopment of properties with or without containing on-site stormwater management practices may be permitted by Mt. Juliet provided the property and downstream public and private properties, infrastructure or waters of the state are adequately protected by a regional facility from stormwater quantity or quality impacts. 
12.  Land disturbance activities shall not be permitted within the floodway. Construction in floodplains, if permitted, shall be done in a way that protects or enhances stormwater quality and promotes land and tree conservation, greenways, floodplains preservation and hazard mitigation. 
13.  Mt. Juliet reserves the right to require a TDEC level 1 certified erosion prevention and sediment control professional to be on-site for inspection and enforcement of proper construction and maintenance of erosion prevention and sediment control management practices at a specific construction site. 
14.  The minimum diameter for all storm drains shall be 15 inches. Cross drains and/or pipes within a public right-of-way, shall be a minimum of 18 inches. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 1.3. - Stormwater management systems. 
    For the purposes of these regulations, stormwater management systems are considered to comprise two parts, the major and minor systems. A brief description of these two parts is presented below. 
1.3.1 Minor systems. The minor system of a stormwater management network is sometimes termed the "initial system" and may consist of a variety of stormwater management appurtenances ranging from inlets, manholes, street gutters, roadside ditches and swales to small channels or pipes, rain gardens, bio-swales and other LID applications. This system collects and may treat the initial stormwater runoff and conveys it to the major system. 
1.3.2 Major systems. The major system primarily consists of natural waterways, waters of the state, large storm sewers, major culverts, bridges and large water impoundments, LID systems, manmade wetlands and cisterns, but it can also include less obvious flow paths such as overland relief swales and infrequent floodplain storage. The major system includes not only the trunk line conveyance that receives the water from the minor system, but also the natural flow path that functions in case of overflow from or failure of the minor system. Properly designed overflow relief shall not flood or damage homes, businesses, or other property. It must always be remembered that the major system is needed for small, medium, and large flood events. Eventually, it will fill with water and flow whether or not it has been planned and designed, and whether or not development is situated wisely with respect to it. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 1.4. - Stormwater quantity and quality management. 
    Increased urbanization within the City of Mt. Juliet has caused radical changes to the topography, ground cover, and minor stormwater management systems within each drainage basin. These changes have adverse effects on the environment, primarily through the subsequent increase in stormwater runoff quantity and nonpoint source pollution which impacts stormwater quality. In some areas, the combination of increased runoff and the location of property near a stream causes frequent flooding (often several times per year). In these areas, upstream control of frequent as well as large flows may not provide adequate flood protection for residents and property downstream. 
    To minimize adverse stormwater quantity and quality impacts, onsite volume management of stormwater is mandatory for all developments that are not served by an adequately sized regional stormwater management facility, subject to review by the City of Mt. Juliet. Because volume management in downstream areas of a large watershed can cause increase peak flows in downstream channels, the City of Mt. Juliet reserves the right to alter the volume management criteria and to prohibit it where it would cause adverse impacts. This decision shall be based on sound engineering judgment along with supporting data and studies. Nevertheless, in all cases where volume management facilities are required, the location and design must comply with any stormwater master plans that may have been adopted. Quality: Design Storm: First Flush Two-year, 15 minutes-15-minute storm per Metro Nashville Intensity Duration Curve. 
    This policy is primarily concerned with maintaining pre-development conditions, for stormwater quality, flood storage, flow volume, and velocity; it should also be applied under certain conditions for the purpose of maintaining adequate capacity of an existing outfall or combining public and private efforts to correct existing deficiencies for flooding, erosion and stormwater quality. In some cases controlling the total volume of runoff to predevelopment levels may also be required. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 1.5. - Stormwater quality management practices. 
    Increased pollutant concentrations and loads impact the ability of the major systems and waters of the state to meet designated use goals. In many cases, the designated use goal for creeks and streams in Mt. Juliet are fishability and swimability. To minimize these stormwater quality impacts, onsite stormwater quality management practices during construction and post construction are mandatory for all developments subject to review by the City of Mt. Juliet. The extent and type of management practices implemented must be proportionate to the land use, pollutant discharge potential. Mt. Juliet encourages that a series of best management practices be implemented that optimize the use of required green and open spaces, especially along buildings and within or along parking lots. The stormwater controls shall be designed to achieve removal of 80 percent of total suspended solids (TSS) and removal of oil and grease. 
    Best management practices(BMP's)shall include but not be limited to: 
 The use of on-site landscaping and vegetation to enhance water quality treatment. 
 The use of "proprietary devices" in combination with primary or secondary BMP's that provide at least 80 percent reduction in total suspended solids (TSS) and removal of oil and grease with no bypass at peak system volume/velocity. 
  The use of low-impact development and design (LID) applications. 
    Acceptable reference documents include: 
 Volume 1- Regulations, Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County Stormwater Management Manual. 
 Volume 4 - Best Management Practices; Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County Stormwater Management Manual. 
 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Low-Impact Development (LID); at www.epa.gov/nps/lid/#guide. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 1.6. - Floodplains. 
    Development of property located within the floodplain is discouraged and, if considered for permitting shall comply with the guidelines established by the City of Mt. Juliet. Wise use of the floodplain is encouraged to minimize adverse effects on flood heights, flow velocities and stormwater quality, as well as maximize land conservation, greenways, floodplain preservation, and hazard mitigation. Buffers are required in and proximate to approved floodways and blue line streams. 
    Areas of the floodplain available for development must be protected through the use of compacted fill, elevated structures, dikes, or floodwalls. Any use of these measures must be in accordance with requirements contained herein. Other floodproofing measures are subject to the approval of the City of Mt. Juliet. (See also FEMA flood insurance guidelines.) 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 1.7. - Erosion and sediment control. 
    All development shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes soil erosion and resulting sedimentation. Under no circumstances is construction to allow sediments to leave a construction site in a way that would be a violation of the site or a violation of the requirements of the City of Mt. Juliet. Site-specific variables such as topography, soil erodibility, stormwater management features, and vegetation shall be considered when developing an erosion control plan. The exposed area of any disturbed land shall be limited to the smallest practical area for the shortest possible period of time. New developments and areas of significant redevelopment shall be required to fulfill the provision in section 5.10 of this volume. This includes the requirement that sediment detention traps shall be required at the fringes of clearing along with silt fences, berms or other equal and appropriate measures. The erosion and sediment controls shall be sized to control runoff and silt for the duration of the project. 
    All development shall comply with appropriate local, state and/or federal requirements for: 
 Approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) through TDEC (Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation). 
 Obtaining an aquatic resources alteration permit (ARAP) through the Corps of Engineers. 
 City of Mt. Juliet approval for a site grading and drainage plan. 
 City of Mt. Juliet approval for a mass grading plan. 
 City of Mt. Juliet Land Disturbance Permit Requirements. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014])

To ensure that floodplain cut and fill balances have been achieved, as-built plans, cross sections, and related calculations must be submitted for all pre-approved floodplain manipulations. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
CHAPTER 3. - PERMITTING PROCEDURES 

Sec. 3.1. - Overview. 
    This chapter explains the procedure for applying for land disturbance permits and the process by which the City of Mt. Juliet reviews permits. Responsibilities of the applicant for posting permits, maintaining compliance with regulations, meeting time limits, and obtaining other required federal and state permits are also discussed. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 3.2. - Application preparation. 
    3.2.1 Preapplication conference. All applicants are encouraged to schedule a preapplication conference with the director of public works to discuss their proposed project. While not mandatory, a preapplication conference is strongly encouraged to assure timely permit application preparation and review. This conference should be used to determine if a proposed project qualifies for exemption and to determine how technical guidelines and criteria should be applied. 
    3.2.2 Required information and checklist. Each application for a land disturbance permit shall be accompanied by a certification that a notice of intent (NOI) has been submitted to TDEC for a Tennessee general stormwater permit or certification that a permit is not required. The review of the plans will proceed if the certification indicates that the applicant will submit the permit number at a later date. If the site requires, a Tennessee general stormwater permit the permit number shall be shown on the grading plans before a grading permit is issued. This certification is presented in appendix C.2. Each application for a land disturbance permit shall contain site preparation plans certified by an appropriate registered design professional. The plans shall indicate whether or not the tract will be developed in stages and timing schedules shall be included when appropriate. In particular, site development plans shall include grading, drainage, and erosion and sediment control plans with appropriate plan and profile sheets for proposed streets or roads and details of the proposed stormwater management systems. An application checklist is provided in appendix C.1, to assist the applicant in preparing a complete application package and thereby ensure a timely review. The applicant shall attach a signed copy of the checklist with the application to certify that a complete package is being submitted. The checklist includes a requirement that the applicant be aware that certain land disturbances activities that will impact waters of the state, wetlands and/or sinkholes may be required to meet additional local, state, and federal regulations. It is the responsibility of the applicant to seek out and obtain any applicable state and federal permits, prior to the initiation of any permit for land disturbance activities. Some requirements of the checklist may not be applicable to all projects, depending on the permit being requested. These should be checked as not applicable. Omissions of any required items shall render the plans incomplete, and they shall be returned to the applicant, or the design professional, for additional information. 
    3.2.3 Grading, drainage and erosion control plans. The grading, drainage, and erosion control plans shall be of quality suitable for reproduction by electronic scanning or microfilm, and shall include as a minimum all of the following:

(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 3.3. - Application process. 
    Applications for site development plans requiring a land disturbance permit shall be submitted to the Mt. Juliet Regional Planning Commission. 
3.3.1 Initial receipt and resubmittals. Permit applications are logged in by date. A basic project information sheet and checklist must be completed in its entirety. Failure by the applicant to complete the basic information sheet and checklist on initial submission may result in a delay in the review of the proposed plans. The project information sheet is included in appendix C.1. The checklist is included in appendix C.1. 
3.3.2 Staff review. The public works staff first conducts a sufficiency review of the permit applications to determine if all basic information has been included. A sufficiency review checklist similar to the application checklist presented in appendix C.1 will be used for this purpose. Should the permit application be determined to be incomplete, the application will be returned to the applicant along with a request for any additional information. When all basic information has been supplied, the planning technician will log in the plans and conduct a technical evaluation of the permit application. This technical evaluation will be based on the technical criteria outlined in chapter 5 of this volume. 
3.3.3 Staff recommendation. If in the opinion of staff, the work described in the permit application, including drawings, conforms to the requirements of these regulations and other pertinent laws and ordinances, a positive recommendation for approval shall be submitted to the regional planning commission for consideration. However, if in the opinion of staff, the application, including the drawings, describes work that does not conform to the requirements of these regulations or other pertinent laws or ordinances, staff shall not recommend approval of the application. The plans shall be stamped "returned for correction," shall be accompanied by written reasons, and returned to the applicant. The opinion of the director of public works shall be based on the results of the sufficiency review and the technical evaluation. 
3.3.4 Revisions to approved plans. Should prior to or during construction, changes be anticipated that would constitute a revision of the plans already approved by the director of public works, the approved plans shall be revised and resubmitted in sufficient quantity by a registered engineer. The resubmission shall include a letter stating why such changes are believed necessary for the approved plans, the grading permit and the completed basic project information form presented in appendix C.1. The City of Mt. Juliet reserves the right to waive the requirement or to re-review the entire set of plans in the light of requested changes. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 3.4. - Construction procedures. 
    A person, firm, or corporation required to obtain a land disturbance permit from the City of Mt. Juliet in compliance with these regulations must do so prior to commencing any work pertaining to the permit. Corrective measures including but not limited to notice of violation, stop work orders, penalties, and injunctions may be taken as required to enforce the terms of this requirement. 
3.4.1 Posting of permit. Work requiring a land disturbance permit shall not be commenced until the requirements of section 2.2.1 permitting have been satisfied. The permit holder or his agent shall post the land disturbance permit in a conspicuous place on the construction site. The permit shall be protected from the weather and be placed to allow easy access for recording entries. The land disturbance permit shall remain posted by the permit holder until the city has issued a use and occupancy permit. 
3.4.2 Effect of permit. A land disturbance permit issued pursuant to this section shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the city, state or federal regulations; nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the City of Mt. Juliet, from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans or in construction or of violations of these regulations. 
3.4.3 Time limits of permit. Unless the work authorized by a land disturbance permit is commenced within six months after the date the permit was issued, the land disturbance permit shall become invalid and a new permit shall be required. If the work, authorized by such permit is not completed in accordance with approved timing schedules, or 12 months from the date of issuance, the permit shall be invalid. However, for just and reasonable cause, one or more extensions for periods not exceeding 90 days each may be allowed. Request for such extensions shall be submitted in writing to the City of Mt. Juliet Director of Public Works. Authorization shall also be in writing. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 3.5. - Federal and state permits. 
    Approval by the City of Mt. Juliet does not relieve the applicant of responsibility for obtaining any permits required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Tennessee Division of Ground Water Protection, region IV of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or by any other federal or state agencies. 
    When any state or federal permit requires stream and/or wetlands mitigation, then any such fee required as a part of the mitigation shall be used 1) locally onsite, 2) locally on streams within the jurisdiction, 3) locally within the extended watershed, or 4) within a negotiated adjoining agency or watershed. If this mitigation process proves impractical within six months of completion of the permitting construction, the mitigation may be directed to the state stream bank or retained locally to support development of parks and greenways. 
3.5.1 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 prohibits the unauthorized obstruction or alteration of any navigable water of the United States unless the work has been previously authorized by the Department of Army (DA) permit. The construction of outfalls, stormwater management outlets, or other structures below ordinary high water of any navigable water will require a DA permit prior to construction. Section 301 of the Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States unless the work has been previously authorized by a permit pursuant to Section 404 of the same Act. Placements of dredged or fill material below ordinary high water of any water in conjunction with stormwater management improvements (e.g., channel realignments, concrete slope paving) will require a DA permit prior to construction. The placements of dredged or fill material or any grading activities within a wetland must also be in compliance with section 404. If a permit were required, approximately 90 days would normally be required for permit processing. Depending on the nature and location of the work, it is possible that the work has been previously approved under authority of the nationwide permit and individual procession would not be required. 
3.5.2 Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation; Division of Water Pollution Control. Any activity that alters the course or physical character of a stream as defined by a hydrologic determination (HD) by the Tennessee Department of Conservation and Environment or by a jurisdictional determination (JD) by the Corps of Engineers, requires an aquatic resources alteration permit (ARAP). This permit is required for activities such as stream channelization, stream enlargement, dredging and diversions in box culverts. Section 405 of the Water Quality Act of 1987 (WCA) added section 402(p) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to require the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) to establish regulations setting forth National Pollutant Discharge Elimination (NPDES) permit application requirements. Projects must be designed with sensitivity to stormwater quality issues and must comply with Section 405 as administered by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
CHAPTER 4. - FLOODPLAIN REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 4.1. - Zoning ordinance. 
    Permitted activities within the floodplain shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of article VIII, section 8-300, floodplain districts, and article XII of the most current edition of the Mt. Juliet zoning ordinance [part B of the Land Development Code], and the most current edition of the City of Mt. Juliet subdivision regulations [part A of the Land Development Code]. The regulations and controls set forth shall be applied within the areas designed on the zoning map or on special overlays that are made a part of the zoning ordinance and may be viewed upon request at the office of the director of public works. However, nothing contained herein shall prohibit the application of the article VIII and article XII regulations to lands that can be demonstrated by competent engineering survey, using adopted profiles from which the flood protection elevation is derived, to lie within any floodplain. Conversely, any lands that can be demonstrated by competent engineering to lie beyond the floodplain shall not be subject to the article VIII and article XII regulations. Any lands within the areas designated as floodplains on the zoning map or special overlays shall be subject to the regulations on controls pertaining to floodplains as set forth in this manual. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 4.2. - Base flood and floodway data. 
    All applications for proposed projects within areas of special flood hazard shall provide base flood elevations and floodway data to establish floodplain easements and lowest floor and fill elevations. Areas of special flood hazard along with base flood elevation and floodway data for many streams in the city are available from the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and the City of Mt. Juliet files. All proposed developments near streams shown to be special flood hazard areas must be designed in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. 
    If a project is located in an unnumbered A zone, the applicant shall provide base flood elevation and floodway data as documented in a flood study when the project is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres. In addition, a flood study shall be required for areas outside unnumbered A zones, when the stream has a tributary area of one square mile or greater. 
    The flood study shall consist of plan and profile data and water surface elevation calculations. The plan view shall show the floodplain water surface limits, floodplain easement lines, base line, cross section stations, and adjacent boundaries. The profile should show stream invert, cross section stations, and computed water surface elevations. 
    The report should also show the topographic divides on the plan and the ultimate zoning categories used. Base flood elevation and floodway data submitted by the applicant for areas previously without such data or for areas not studied by FEMA, shall be reviewed by the director of public works, and if acceptable, shall be processed for adoption as part of the official floodplain management data for these regulations. When the base flood elevation and floodway data submitted by the applicant results in deviation from the data developed by FEMA, such deviation shall become official following review and approval by both the director of public works and FEMA. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 4.3. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard, the following minimum provisions are required: 
1.  New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
2.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in accordance to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
3.  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
4.  New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

9.  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of these regulations shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or replaced. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 4.4. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been provided, the provisions detailed below are required. It is the intent of the City of Mt. Juliet that all construction, whether within or adjacent to the delineated floodplains, shall be subject to the provisions of these regulations. As an example, all residential construction shall be elevated such that the lowest floor is not lower than four feet above the base flood elevation. Exceptions to this standard may be granted on appeal to the regional planning commission based on a demonstration that the regulatory elevation places an unreasonable burden upon the developers or property owners. 
4.4.1 Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvements of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than four feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards. 
4.4.2 Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles shall meet the following provisions: 
1.  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring. 
2.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than four feet above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade, support the manufactured home chassis. 
c.  The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
d.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or substantially improved must meet the standard for elevation and anchoring listed above. 
3.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
a.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, that is, it must be on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached structures, or 
b.  The recreational vehicle must meet all requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring in items 1 and 2 above. 
4.4.3 Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (including manufactured structures) shall have the lowest flood, including basement, at least two feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Structures located in A and AE zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered engineer or architect shall certify that these standards are satisfied. 
4.4.4 Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space. Design shall also allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a registered engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  A minimum of two openings having a total net of not less than one square inch shall be provided for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
3.  Openings shall be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation. Access to the enclosed areas shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
4.4.5 Floodways; conservation easement areas. Areas designated as floodways are located within areas of special flood hazard. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area because of the velocity of floodwaters, which can carry debris and potential projectiles and have erosion potential. Floodways are also used as a base in determining the width of the required stream buffer as described in section 4, paragraph 9. Thus, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments, including fill, excavation, clearing, new construction and other development, are prohibited within a designated floodway. 
2.  Areas within floodways shall be set aside as a conservation easement area in accordance with section 4.-101.401 of the subdivision regulations [part A of the Land Development Code]. 
3.  The placement of manufactured homes is prohibited within areas of special flood hazard. 
    The open space uses listed below shall be permitted within the floodway to the extent that they are not prohibited in a particular area by any base zoning ordinance and all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of these regulations are met. 
1.  Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming and wild crop harvesting. 
2.  Public and private recreational uses not requiring permanent or temporary structures designed for human habitation; some examples are parks, greenways, swimming areas, golf courses, driving ranges, picnic grounds, wildlife and nature preserves, game and skeet ranges, and hunting, fishing and hiking areas. 
3.  Utility facilities such as flowage areas, transmission lines, pipelines, water monitoring devices, roadways and bridges. 
4.4.6 Floodplain alterations. Floodplain alterations, approved by the City of Mt. Juliet, that result in the filling or elimination of floodplain storage shall provide compensating storage capacity by dredging out at least an equal amount of volume as occupied by fill. All dredged or cut materials shall be removed from the site before fill materials can be delivered; unless all fill material is generated onsite. Dredging or cut volumes below the elevation of the two-year storm event shall not be included in the compensating storage capacity calculation. Every effort shall be made to preserve natural flow lines and to avoid situations that encourage sediment deposition in slack water areas. All dredged or cut areas shall be stabilized immediately to prevent erosion. Areas to be filled must be cleared of standing trees, stumps, brush, down timber, and all objects including structures on and above the ground surface. Topsoil shall be removed and stockpiled, while other spoil materials must be disposed of offsite. Fill material obtained offsite shall not be stockpiled onsite before grading cuts are completed. Fill material shall be placed in compacted layers and the minimum distance from the perimeter of any proposed building to the top of the slope shall be either 25 feet or twice the depth of fill at that point, whichever is greater. The fill material must not have slopes equal to or greater than 3:1 unless stabilization measures approved by the city engineer are installed. All slopes shall be stabilized. No alterations can be made to the floodplain and stormwater management channels without the written approval of the director of public works. All applicable requirements of these regulations and the following specific conditions must be met before such approval will be granted: 
1.  The construction of a levee, earth fill, building, or other structure that alters a floodplain area shall be permitted based on a plan prepared by a registered engineer, showing existing and proposed elevations, existing and proposed stormwater management channels, and existing and proposed structures. The director of public works, certifying that the alteration and construction as proposed are in compliance with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of these regulations, shall approve the plan. 
2.  The same shall approve the proposed excavation, filling or change of alignment of any existing channel under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
3.  The Mt. Juliet Regional Planning Commission shall approve the plan. Any duly approved alteration of the floodplain will be so noted on the official zoning map as a matter of information. The director of public works will make this notation upon certification to the planning commission that such alteration has been completed in accordance with the approved plan. 
4.4.7 Floodproofing. Floodproofing measures such as those identified below are acceptable provided they are certified by a registered engineer or architect as being consistent with the base flood conditions for the particular area, and that floodproofing criteria for nonresidential construction in [sub]section 4.4.3 are met. 
1.  Anchoring to resist flotation and lateral movement. 
2.  Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters. 
3.  Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures. 
4.  Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of water through walls. 
5.  Addition of mass or weight to structure to resist flotation. 
6.  Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures. 
7.  Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems to prevent the entrance of floodwaters. 
8.  Pumping facilities for subsurface stormwater management systems for buildings to relieve external foundation wall and basement floor pressures. 
9.  Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or flotation debris. 
10.  Cutoff valves on sewer lines or the elimination of gravity flow basement drains. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 4.5. - Standard for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway. 
    No encroachments, including fill material and structures, shall be located within an undisturbed stream buffer. The width of said undisturbed stream buffer shall be as determined in article IV, section 4-102.102 [subdivision regulations in part A of the Land Development Code]. 
    For proposed developments located near small streams but where no base flood data or floodways have been provided or required under the federal flood insurance program or by section 4.2 of these regulations, the following provisions apply: 
1.  No encroachments, including fill material and structures, shall be located within a minimum distance of 50 feet from the top of the stream bank on each side. 
2.  New construction or substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least four feet above the base flood elevation as determined by an appropriate approximate method. 
3.  New construction and substantial improvement of nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 4.6. - Subdivision standards. 
    All subdivision projects shall meet the following provisions: 
1.  Design shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
2.  Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems shall be located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
3.  Stormwater management facilities shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
4.  Base flood elevation and floodway data shall be provided as required in section 4.2. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014])

    The existing lawful use of a structure or premises that is not in conformity with the floodplain requirements of this manual may be continued subject to the following conditions: 
1.  No such use shall be expanded or enlarged except in conformity with the provisions of this manual. 
2.  No structural alterations, additions to, or repairs to any nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall exceed 50 percent of its assessed value at the time of its becoming a nonconforming use unless permanently changed. 
3.  If such use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future used of the building and premises shall conform to the provisions of this manual. 
4.  Uses or adjuncts thereof, which are nuisances, shall not be permitted to continue as nonconforming uses. 
5.  Any alteration, addition to, or repair to any nonconforming structure permitted shall be protected by floodproofing measures pursuant to [sub]section 4.4.7. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 4.8. - Dikes and floodwalls. 
    The design of dikes and floodwalls for flood protection purposes should consider several factors, including alternate compensating storage, possible surcharge in flood heights, overtopping, and failure. 
    Dikes are generally earth embankments that can extend sections of a building. Fill material used in their construction should be dredged from the floodplain to aid in providing compensating storage. The fill material shall be placed on cleared ground, compacted in layers, and protected from seepage. Buildings shall have a minimum setback from the base of the dike of 25 feet or twice the height of the embankment whichever is greater. 
    Floodwalls are preferred for locations with limited space and can be constructed as cantilever I-type steel piles, cellular walls, buttress walls, or gravity walls. They shall be well founded with cutoffs installed to prevent seepage. Areas located behind a dike or floodwall should be drained by conduits installed with automatic flap gates to prevent backflow, or by manually operated valves that are closed during flooding, or by a combination of these methods. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 4.9. - Buffers. 
    New development and significant redevelopment in or adjacent to the floodplain and floodway shall include buffers in the proposed plans. The buffer along waterways will be an area where the surface is left in a natural state and is not disturbed by construction activity. 
4.9.1 Buffer areas defined. The buffer shall be as defined in article IV, section 4-102.102 [of the subdivision regulations in part A of the Land Development Code]. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
CHAPTER 5. - TECHNICAL GUIDELINES AND CRITERIA 

Sec. 5.1. - Adequate stormwater management systems. 
    Adequate stormwater management systems shall have the hydraulic capacity to accommodate the maximum expected stormwater discharge for a specified tributary area and precipitation duration and intensity. 
    Adequate stormwater management systems shall be designed to accomplish the following: 
1.  Account for both offsite and onsite stormwater. 
2.  Maintain natural topographic divides. 
3.  Convey stormwater to a stream, natural channel, or other existing facility. 
4.  Discharge stormwater into the natural channel by connecting the channel at natural elevations, or by discharging the stormwater into an existing facility of sufficient capacity to receive it. 
5.  Limit or control erosion and/or sediment leaving the site to predevelopment levels through the use of appropriate stormwater quality best management practices. 
    Determination of the size and capacity of an adequate stormwater management system shall take into account the future development in the watershed or affected portions thereof. The design must not adversely affect adjacent or neighboring properties. 
    It is the responsibility of the developer or property owner to pick up or acceptably handle the quantity of runoff as it flows onto their property from the watershed above, and conduct it through the property to an adequate outfall at the lower property line or beyond. The outfall must be sufficient to receive the runoff without deterioration of the downstream channel. 
    The stormwater management system for new developments shall be designed to enhance stormwater quality for runoff, or a portion thereof, entering the property from the above watershed. New developments and areas of significant redevelopment are required to control stormwater quality for runoff from their site per the requirements of section 1.5, Stormwater Quality Management Practices, to predevelopment levels through the use of best management practice. If it is not feasible to implement an on-site stormwater quality best management practices then the developer may, with approval from the director of public works, design a system that controls quality for an equivalent portion of runoff entering from the watershed above. 
    5.1.1 Minor systems. The design of pipes, inlets, and outfall structures the minor stormwater management system shall be based on a storm frequency of 25 years. This criterion shall be applied on both closed conduit and open channel systems. However, if the 25-year design flow for an open channel system is greater than 100 cubic feet per seconds (cfs), then the open or closed system shall be capable of passing the 100-year design flow within the drainage easement. In residential subdivision developments where the average lot size is less than 20,000 square feet, the following general guidelines shall be observed in the design of the minor system: 
1.  Site grading design shall minimize runoff across lots. Design priority shall be to direct runoff to the front or rear of lots along side lot lines. 
2.  Design surface runoff across lots shall not have erosive velocities. 
3.  Quantities of surface runoff greater than four cfs that flow through lots shall be collected and conveyed in a system of open channels, closed conduits, or a combination of both. 
4.  Lots should generally be graded in such a manner that surface runoff is collected in a system of open channels, closed conduits, or a combination of both. However, runoff will be permitted to cross more than one lot before it is collected if the system is designed to achieve stormwater quality benefit and does not pose a risk of erosion or other damage to public or private property. This may only be performed with approval from the director of public works. 
    Design flows may be determined by acceptable methods including the Rational Method, Soil Conservation Service (SCS) methodology, and the Unit Hydrograph Method. 
    5.1.2 Major systems. Wherever possible, natural waterways serving the major system should remain undisturbed, with proposed development situated accordingly. Detention may be required to avoid discharges that exceed the capacity of downstream natural waterways. Channelization and other related modifications to the natural waterways are discouraged. Improvements to natural open channels that are to function primarily as the major system shall be designed to pass the 100-year design flow without damage to the channel. Manmade channels designed to function, as the major system (trunk line system), shall be capable of carrying a 100-year design flow. Where manmade channels are necessary, the channels should be located as far away from buildings or structures as possible and preferably in established greenways or other conservation corridors. The on-site major stormwater management system for most developments is the natural backup system and consists of the less obvious drainageways. Ideally, this major system should provide relief such that no building will be flooded with a 100-year design flow even if the minor system capacity is exceeded. The 100-year frequency storm shall be used to compute runoff for the design of the onsite major stormwater management system. This system shall be designed to provide relief for flow in excess of the 25-year design flow. The following guidelines pertain to design of the onsite major stormwater management system: 
1.  Areas should be graded in such a manner or buildings located or constructed in such a manner that if the capacity of the minor system is exceeded; no building will be flooded by the design flow. 
2.  Critical areas to consider are sumps, relatively flat areas, and areas where buildings are located below streets or parking lots. 
3.  The 100-year frequency storm for the duration equivalent to the time of concentration shall be used to compute runoff for the major stormwater management system. 
4.  For the first trial, the same time of concentration values shall be used that were used in designing the minor stormwater management system and the minor system assumed to be completely inoperable. If no building will be flooded based on these assumptions, then the analysis can be considered complete. 
5.  If buildings will be flooded based on the assumptions used in the preceding item, more precise hydrologic and hydraulic computations are required. The minor system, overland relief swales, or surface storage should be designed so that flooding will damage no building. 
6.  In general, the minor stormwater management system should not be oversized as a basis for providing major system capacity. The major stormwater management system should be in the form of area grading or the location and construction of buildings in such a manner that overland relief swales or surface storage will provide adequate flood protection. 
    The major stormwater management system should be evident on the drainage plan, including overland relief swales and areas that may be affected by surface storage for a 100-year design storm. Calculations performed for major system design should be submitted with the drainage plan. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.2. - Open channels. 
    5.2.1 Channel capacity. Open channel capacity shall be determined by Manning's equation. 
    5.2.2 Lined channels. Open channels may be designed as hard-armored, geosynthetic or soil bioengineering lined channels. Acceptable lining material must be placed in accordance with manufacturers' requirements. Approval of lining materials is subject to review by the director of public works. Channel lining shall be required when the design velocity exceeds the allowable, nonerosive velocity for a given channel reach and no other erosion control measures provide adequate protection. 
    5.2.3 Grassed channels. The design of grassed channels shall consider the variable degree of retardant generated by different types of cover. Temporary erosion control shall be utilized during nongrowing seasons and during grass cover establishment. The engineer shall note on the drawings or in the specifications that "All grassed channels must be in a well-established condition and show no sign of erosion at the time of final acceptance by the Mt. Juliet, Department of Public Works." 
    5.2.4 Easement width. All open channels shall be located within the right-of-way of a public utility and drainage easement. Minimum easement width shall be determined from table 5-1. 
Table 5-1. Minimum Easement Width for Open Channels Top Width of Channel Easement Width Less than 5 feet 10 feet 5-20 feet 10 feet greater than top width, with minimum of 5 feet on one side Greater than 20 feet 15 feet greater than top width, with minimum of 5 feet on one side  
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.3. - Storm pipes and culverts. 
    5.3.1 Conduit capacity. Closed conduits shall be designed for the total flow intercepted by the inlets during the design storm event. 
    5.3.2 Pressure flow. Storm drain system should generally be designed as nonpressure systems. However, pressure flow systems, if coordinated with the director of public works during the preliminary design phase, may be allowed. The hydraulic gradient for pressure flow systems shall not exceed the following criteria: 
1.  An elevation greater than one foot below the established rim or inlet elevation. 
2.  More than five feet above the crown of the conduit. 
    5.3.3 Easement width. Minimum allowable easement width for stormwater pipes and culverts shall be determined from [the following] table 5-2: 
Table 5-2. Minimum Easement Width for Storm Drains Conduit Size Easement Width 15-18 inches 10 feet 21-33 inches 15 feet 36-48 inches 20 feet 54-72 inches 25 feet  
    5.3.4 Inlets. Inlets shall be designed to convey the 25-year frequency, time of concentration storm event. 
    5.3.5 Culverts. The design flow for culverts shall be based on the following return frequencies: 
1.  100-year for residential collector and commercial road crossings. 
2.  25-year for residential roads and crossings. 
    In addition, building elevations shall be checked for flooding caused by the 100-year, 24-hour storm. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.4. - Outlet protection. 
    The design discharge at the outlet of stormwater management systems shall not result in velocities that equal or exceed the erosive velocity of the receiving channel, unless energy dissipation and permanent erosion protection measures are placed at the outlet. Energy dissipation and erosion control devices shall have no overfall at the terminal end and shall discharge onto a stable section. The terminal section shall be considered stable if the terminal section design velocity is less than the erosive velocity. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.5. - Bridges. 
    All bridges shall be designed for the 100-year, 24-hour storm event. The design flow shall consider runoff from the total tributary area and will require stream channel routing, as appropriate. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.6. - Stormwater management (detention). 
    5.6.1 Release rate. The release rate from any detention facility should approximate that of the site prior to the proposed development for the two-year, ten-year and 25-year storms, with emergency overflow capable of handling at least the 100-year discharge. Detention systems must be constructed during the first phase of major developments to eliminate damage to adjacent properties during construction. In this regard, the detention systems shall be designed to function as sediment traps per the TDEC Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook and cleaned out to proper volumes before completion. If siltation has occurred, detention systems must be restored to their design dimensions after construction is complete and certified as part of the as-built submittal (see section 2.3). 
    5.6.2 Stormwater detention. Stormwater detention systems shall be designed to address the following design criteria: 
1.  The detention system shall be designed to address the stormwater runoff from the 25-year, one hour storm with a minimum of one foot of freeboard between the 25-year water surface elevation and the lowest elevation of the basin wall, including any overflow weir or notch. 
2.  The stormwater runoff for the two-year, ten-year, twenty-five year and 100-year storm shall be routed through the basin. The outlet structure shall be designed to detain the excess runoff from the two-year, ten-year, and 25-year storm. Post development flows shall not exceed pre-development flow. 
3.  If the calculated runoff for the 100-year storm over tops the basin, then an emergency overflow weir shall be provided with the outlet from this weir being designed to prohibit erosion of the basin wall and shall be located offset from the basin discharge structure. 
    5.6.3 Drawdown. Detention storage volume shall be drained within 72 hours. This requirement includes that volume above any permanent pool. Drawdown may be accomplished by a V-notch weir, perforated standpipe, small orifice, or complex geometry weir. Calculations shall be provided for sizing the drawdown orifice or other application. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.7. - Stormwater management (water quality). 
    Stormwater quality management practices are to be applied to all new developments. 
    5.7.1 Stormwater criteria. On-site stormwater quality management shall address the first-flush flow from the developed site. The first flush flow can be calculated from the two-year, 15-minute storm for Metro Nashville. Acceptable stormwater quality management applications include: 
1.  Low impact development and design (LID). 
2.  Structural or proprietary devices. 
3.  Utilization of site landscaping. 
    Stormwater quality management applications shall be designed to remove 80 percent of the total suspended solids (TSS) from the first flush runoff in addition to removal of oils and grease. 
    5.7.2 Dry and wet detention design criteria. All stormwater management dry or wet detention facilities designs shall consider the following criteria: 
1.  Bleed down or "live" storage volume of the first 0.5 to 1.0 inches of runoff and residence time to 24 to 72 hours for dry ponds and 24 to 60 hours for wet ponds. 
2.  Permanent pond volume hydraulic residence time of two to four weeks. 
3.  Sediment forebay, baffle boxes or equivalent pretreatment device with high flow (100-year storm frequency or greater) bypass. 
4.  Length to width ratio of at least 4:1. 
5.  Energy dissipating inlet structures. 
6.  Safe side slopes. 
7.  Oil and grease traps or floatable debris skimmers. 
8.  Maximum permanent pool depth of no more than 12 feet unless re-circulated with an aerator or fountain. 
9.  For wet ponds, a littoral zone of 10-30 percent pond coverage within three years of planting. 
10.  The City of Mt. Juliet strongly encourages that major stormwater management controls, especially detention facilities, be designed as off-line devices. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.8. - Stormwater infrastructure maintenance. 
    Care must be taken to ensure that any required stormwater management facilities do not become nuisances or health hazards. Stormwater quality management practices generally require more maintenance than stormwater quantity management practices. Detention facilities should be designed to require minimal maintenance, and maintenance responsibility must be clearly stated on the plans. Where flat grades or poorly draining soils are encountered, provisions for adequate low flow stormwater management system may be required. Where the retention/detention facility is planned to be used as a lake, pond, or stormwater quality management practice with a permanent pool; water budget calculations shall be performed and submitted to demonstrate that an adequate pool is expected during dry summer months. 
    All stormwater management facilities shall be within a permanent drainage easement and shall be maintained by the appropriate homeowners' association, or property owner. Stormwater management facilities located in condominium developments, apartment or townhouse complexes, single family PUDs, industrial, commercial, or institutional developments shall be within a permanent drainage easement and maintained by the property owner or homeowners' association. A stormwater maintenance agreement shall be executed, recorded and listed by deed book and page on the site development drawings before the development plan is approved. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.9. - Stormwater pollution prevention protection plan (SWPPP). 
    A stormwater pollution prevention protection plan (SWPPP) shall identify the erosion control practices and sediment trapping facilities, which are appropriate for the actual site conditions. The SWPPP shall be submitted to TDEC for approval and issuance of an NOC Tracking number. In addition, the appropriate schedule of implementation shall be identified. Particular attention is required for concentrated stormwater flows. Either concentrated stormwater flows shall be avoided or the conveyance system shall be protected sufficiently to prevent significant erosion. Sediment trapping devices are required at all points where stormwater leaves a site laden with sediment. The plan shall identify provisions including, but not limited to, the following: 
1.  Erosion prevention on denuded areas. 
2.  Nonstructural management practices to be implemented. 
3.  Perimeter controls. 
4.  Permanent stormwater conveyance structures. 
5.  Final stabilized conditions of the site. 
6.  Provisions for removing temporary control measures. 
7.  Stabilization of the site where temporary measures are removed. 
8.  Maintenance requirements for temporary management practices including minimum inspection requirements. 
9.  Maintenance requirements for any permanent measures. 
    5.9.1 Stabilization of denuded areas and soil stockpiles. Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site. Soil stabilization shall also be applied within 15 days to any portion of denuded areas, which may not be at final grade, but will remain dormant (undisturbed) for longer than 60 days. Soil stabilization refers to measures that protect soil from the erosive forces of raindrop impact and flowing water. Applicable practices include, but are not limited to, vegetative establishment, mulching, and the early application of gravel base on areas to be paved. Selected soil stabilization measures should be appropriate for the time of year, site conditions, and estimated duration of use. Soil stockpiles shall be stabilized if left undisturbed for 15 or more days. They shall be protected with sediment trapping measures that may include sediment traps or detention ponds to prevent soil loss from the project site throughout the life of the soil stockpiling practices. 
    5.9.2 Establishment of permanent vegetation. A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of the stormwater coordinator, is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive severe weather conditions. 
    5.9.3 Protection of adjacent properties. Properties adjacent to the site of a land disturbance shall be protected from sediment deposition. This may be accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land disturbance; by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters, diversion berms, or sediment basins; or by a combination of such measures. Vegetated buffer strips may be used alone only where runoffs in sheet flow if expected. Buffer strips should be at least 60 feet in width. If at any time it is found that a vegetated buffer strip alone is ineffective in stopping sediment movement onto adjacent property, additional perimeter controls shall be required. 
    5.9.4 Timing and stabilization of sediment trapping measures. Sediment basins and traps, perimeter berms, sediment, barriers, and other measures intended to trap sediment onsite shall be constructed as a first step in grading, and be made functional before upslope land disturbance takes place. All sediment control practices at hydraulic outlets from the site must be installed before additional construction may take place. See section 2.2.2 of this volume. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded and mulched within 15 days of installation. 
    5.9.5 Sediment basins. Stormwater runoff from tributary areas with five acres or greater disturbed area shall pass through a sediment basin or other suitable sediment trapping facility. 
    5.9.6 Cut and fills slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner which will minimize erosion. Consideration must be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the soil type, upslope tributary area, groundwater conditions, and other applicable factors. As a minimum, all slopes at 3:1 or greater shall be stabilized with rock riprap, geosynthetic material, or other method approved by the stormwater coordinator. 
    5.9.7 Construction exits. A stabilized stone pad shall be placed at any point where traffic will be leaving a construction site to a public right-of-way, street, alley, sidewalk, or parking lot. Stone pads shall contain ASTM-1 stone, six inches thick, 20 feet wide, and be a minimum of 100 feet long. 
    5.9.8 Deficient performance. If at any time it is determined by the department of public works, the property owner or designated construction site inspector/manager that the erosion prevention and sediment control practices as originally designed are not capable of preventing sediment from leaving the site under storm conditions, then additional controls shall be implemented. Additional controls shall be implemented to a level and until a time in which the stormwater coordinator is satisfied that the controls are adequate. If Mt. Juliet, DPW inspectors determine that adequate inspections and maintenance procedures are not being implemented or the controls designed are not meeting performance objectives presented in this chapter then the Mt. Juliet, DPW may issue a notice of violation, a stop work order, rescind a land disturbance permit, or take other appropriate legal action. See section 2.1 of these regulations. 
(Amend. of [7-2-2014]) 
Sec. 5.10. - Gutter and inlet hydraulics. 
(a)  Synopsis. The level of service of facilities that provide drainage of roadway surfaces should be consistent with the level of service of the roadway. Guidelines are given for evaluating roadway features and design criteria as they relate to gutter and inlet hydraulics. Procedures for performing gutter flow calculations are based on a modification of Manning's equation. Inlet capacity calculations for grated and combination inlets are based on information contained in HEC-12 (USDOT, FHWA, 1984) City of Mt. Juliet specific design information is presented for typical details contained in the Standard Drawings of the City of Mt. Juliet Public Works Department. 
(b)  Design criteria. The following design criteria are typically important for gutter and inlet capacity calculations: 
(1)  Return period. 
(2)  Spread. 
(3)  Inlet types and spacing. 
(4)  Manning's n values. 
(5)  Grade. 
(6)  Cross slope. 
(7)  Curb and gutter sections. 
(8)  Roadside and median ditches. 
(9)  Bridge decks. 
(c)  Return period. The design storm return period for pavement drainage should be consistent with the frequency selected for other components of the drainage system. 
(d)  Spread. For multilaned curb and gutter or guttered roadways with no parking, it is not practical to avoid travel lane flooding when grades are flat (1.0) percent. However, flooding should never exceed the lane adjacent to the gutter (or shoulder) for design conditions. Standard practice in the city is to limit maximum stormwater spread to eight feet, measured from the face of the curb. Municipal bridges with curb and gutter should also use this criterion. For single-lane roadways, at least eight feet of roadway should remain unflooded for design conditions. 
(e)  Inlet types and spacing. Inlet types shall be selected from standard drawings DR-105, DR-110, and DR-115 of the city public works department standard drawings set forth in Appendix B. Inlets shall be located or spaced in such a manner that the design curb flow does not exceed the spread criterion of eight feet. No flow will be allowed to cross intersecting streets unless approved by the city department of public works. In addition, curb and gutter inlets should not be built in curb returns. 
(f)  Manning's n values. Manning's n values for various pavement surfaces are presented in the table in subsection (l) of this section. 
(g)  Grade. Curb and gutter grades that are equal to pavement slopes shall not exceed 13 percent or fall below one percent without approval from the city department of public works. A minimum longitudinal gradient is more important for curbed pavements, which are susceptible to stormwater spread. Flat gradients on uncurbed pavements can lead to a spread problem if vegetation is allowed to build up along the pavement edge. 
(h)  Cross slope. The design of pavement cross slope is often a compromise between the need for reasonably steep cross slopes for drainage and relatively flat cross slopes for driver comfort. In most city design situations, cross slopes will be defined by the standard pavement sections given on standard drawings ST-101, ST-102, ST-105, ST-106, ST-108, ST-109, ST-111, and ST-112 of the city public works department standard drawings for streets and roads set forth in Appendix B. The standard city cross slope is a four-inch crown over the edge of the pavement. When three or more lanes are inclined in the same direction on multilane pavements, it is desirable for each successive pair of lanes, or the portion thereof outward from the first two lanes from the crown line, to have an increased slope. The two lanes adjacent to the crown line should be pitched at the normal slope, and successive lane pairs, or portions thereof outward, should be increased by about 0.5 to 1.0 percent. Where three or more lanes are provided in each direction, the maximum pavement cross slope should be limited to four percent. 
(i)  Curbs and gutter sections. Curbing at the outside edge of pavements is normal practice for low-speed, urban highway facilities. Curb and curb and gutter details are presented in standard drawings ST-200, ST-202, ST-203, and ST-204 of the city public works department standard drawings set forth in Appendix B. Standard gutter width is as shown on the details. Gutters are on the same cross slope as the pavement on the high side and depressed with a steeper cross slope on the low side, usually one inch per foot. Typical practice is to place curbs at the outside edge of shoulders or parking lanes on low speed facilities. 
(j)  Roadside and median ditches. Roadside ditches are commonly used with uncurbed roadway sections to convey pavement runoff and up gradient area runoff that drains toward the pavement. Right-of-way limitations prevent use of roadside ditches in densely developed urban areas. They can be used in cut sections, depressed sections, and other locations where sufficient right-of-way is available and driveways or intersections are infrequent. Curbed highway sections are relatively inefficient at conveying water, and the area tributary to the gutter section should be kept to a minimum to reduce the hazard from water on the pavement. Where practicable, the flow from major areas draining toward curbed highway pavements should be intercepted by ditches as appropriate. It is preferable to slope median areas and inside shoulders to a center swale, to prevent drainage from the median areas from running across the pavement. This is particularly important for high-speed facilities and for facilities with more than two lanes of traffic in each direction. 
(k)  Bridge decks. Drainage of bridge decks is similar to other curbed roadway sections. It is often less efficient, because cross slopes are flatter, parapets collect large amounts of debris, and small drainage inlets on scuppers have a higher potential for clogging by debris. Bridge deck constructability usually requires a constant cross slope, so the guidelines in subsection (h) of this section do not apply. Because of the difficulties in providing and maintaining adequate deck drainage systems, gutter flow from roadways should be intercepted before it reaches a bridge. In many cases, deck drainage must be carried several spans to the bridge and for disposal. Zero gradients and sag vertical curves should be avoided on bridges. The minimum desirable grade for bridge deck drainage should be 1.0 percent. When bridges are placed at a vertical curve and the grade is less than 1.0 percent, the gutter spread should be checked to ensure a safe, reasonable design. Scuppers are the recommended method of deck drainage, because they can reduce the problems of transporting a relatively large concentration of runoff in an area of generally limited right-of-way. They also have a low initial cost and are relatively easy to maintain. However, the use of scuppers should be evaluated for site-specific concerns. Scuppers should not be located over embankments, slope pavements, slope protection, navigation channels, driving lanes, or railroad tracks. Runoff collected and transported to the end of the bridge should generally be collected by inlets and down drains, although sod flumes may be used for extremely minor flows in some areas. 
(l)  Gutter flow calculations. The following form of Manning's equation should be used to evaluate gutter flow hydraulics: 
Q = 0.56 S 5/3 S 1/2 T8/3 (5-1) N x Where: Q = Gutter flow rate, in cfs N = Manning's roughness coefficient S = Pavement cross slope, in feet X S = Grade, in feet/foot T = Width of flow or spread, in feet  
Nomographs for solving equation 5-1 are presented in other technical literature.

We are issuing coverage under the permit in response to your notice of intent (NOI) received by us on March 27, 2003, and reviewed by our local office in Nashville and the permit section in Nashville.  
(b)  The permit requires that you begin implementing six stormwater management measures. You must submit annual reports each year, beginning September 30, 2004, reporting on implementation of these programs. We point out two items, which especially affect ordinances, staff training and budgeting: 
(1)  You must ensure that certain ordinances be in place by December 31, 2004; the persons involved in reviewing and approving ordinances will need education on these issues and need time to review the ordinances; and 
(2)  To implement the construction site runoff control program by December 31, 2005, your staff must be trained in review of erosion prevention and sediment control plans and inspection and enforcement protocol; you may need additional staff for this program. 
(c)  You may access the permit in electronic format and find links to various compliance assistance resources by visiting our web page at www.state.tn.us/environment/upc/stormh2o/MS4II.php. 
(d)  If you have questions, please contact the division of water pollution control at your local environmental assistance center at 1-888-891-TDEC; or, at this office, please contact Mr. Jim McAdoo at (615)532-0684 or by email at Jim.McAdoo@state.tn.us.
