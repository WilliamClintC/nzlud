GENERAL REFERENCES
Administrative Board of Appeals  See Ch. 6. Zoning  See Ch. 240.
§ 71-1. Purpose and findings.
Supervisors of Richland Township shall publish the same in their official
journal.
A. Purpose.
(1) Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township
Code27 to prohibit nuisances; to promote the health, welfare,
cleanliness, comfort and safety of the citizens of Richland
Township; to regulate buildings; and to regulate the time of
opening and closing and the conduct of places of public
entertainment, amusement and recreation, the Township of
Richland enacts this chapter to minimize and control the adverse
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby
26.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
27.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 65101 et seq.
§ 62-6 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT § 71-1
71:61
protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; protect the
citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve
the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods;
and deter the spread of blight.
(2) The Board of Supervisors has determined that licensing is a
legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that
operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable
regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
(3) The Board of Supervisors does not intend this chapter to suppress
any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to
enact a content-neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses. It is not the intent of the
Board in enacting this legislation to deny any person rights of
speech protected by the Constitution of the United States or the
Constitution of Pennsylvania, or both, nor is it the intent of the
Board to impose by this chapter any additional limitations or
restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books and other
materials. Further, by enacting this legislation, the Board does not
intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view,
or both, any sexually oriented materials or conduct protected by
the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of
Pennsylvania, or both, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any
constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of
sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit
these materials.
B. Legislative findings. The Board of Supervisors finds:
(1) Statistics and studies performed in a substantial number of
communities in this commonwealth and in the United States
indicate that sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary
effects, including those specified and recognized at 68 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 5501(a), which secondary effects should be regulated to protect
the public health, safety and welfare. These secondary effects
include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases,
performance of sexual acts in public places, presence of discarded
sexually oriented materials on public and private property, sexual
harassment, obscenity, prostitution and other illegal sexual
activities, crime and neighborhood deterioration.
(2) Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects,
which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public
health, safety and welfare.
(3) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
§ 71-1 RICHLAND CODE § 71-1
71:62
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run
in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the township. It
is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee
is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
(4) Removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in discouraging the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
(5) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential
witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in
such establishments.
(6) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business will help limit and control the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses.
(7) It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this
chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to
such activity.
(8) The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license,
or an employee thereof, has been convicted of a sexually related
crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to
engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
(9) The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to
and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
(10) The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the
township will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
(11) Limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to
8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. reduces the adverse secondary effects of
such businesses, including, particularly, but not limited to late
night noise levels, crime and sexually offensive materials and
activities in public areas, and promotes the public health, safety
and welfare.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 108-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Richland Cable
Communications Regulatory Code."
§ 108-2. Purpose.
A. The Township of Richland (the "municipality") finds that the further
development of cable communications may result in great benefits for
the people of the municipality. Because of the complex and rapidly
changing technology associated with cable communications, the
municipality further finds that the public convenience, safety and
general welfare can best be served by establishing certain regulatory
procedures and powers that are vested in the municipality or such
persons or agencies as the municipality shall designate. Any franchise
issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding
as an integral part thereof.
B. Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide
not only entertainment and information services to the municipality's
residents, but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive
communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of these
services involve municipal agencies and other public institutions.
C. For these purposes, the following goals, among others, underlie the
regulations contained herein:
(1) Cable services should be provided to the maximum number of
municipal residents.
(2) Cable systems should be capable of accommodating both the
present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of
the municipality.
(3) A cable system should be improved and upgraded expeditiously
during the term of a franchise so that new facilities necessary for
the operation of the system may be integrated to the maximum
extent possible with existing facilities, subject to public demand
and economic and technical feasibility.
(4) Cable systems authorized by this chapter shall be responsive to the
needs and interests of the local community and shall provide the
widest possible diversity of information sources and service to the
public.

Grant of Franchise
§ 108-4. Authority to grant; franchise agreement required.
§ 108-5. Franchise characteristics.
A franchise authorizes use of public rights-of-way for installing cables,
wires, lines, optical fibers, underground conduit and other devices
necessary and appurtenant to the operation of a cable system within a
franchise area, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize a franchisee
to provide service to, or install a cable system on, private property without
owner consent [except for use of compatible easements pursuant to Section
621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(2)], or to use publicly or privately
owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owners.

§ 108-7. Franchisee subject to other laws and police power.
A. The municipality may grant one or more franchises, and each such

provisions of this chapter. A franchise shall constitute both a right and
an obligation to provide the cable services regulated by the provisions
of this chapter and the franchise agreement.
B. No person may construct or operate a cable system without a franchise
granted by the municipality. No person may be granted a franchise
without having entered into a franchise agreement with the

reserves the right to reasonably designate where a franchisee's
facilities are to be placed within the public rights-of-way.

requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the municipality
regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction.

108:121
§ 108-8. Interpretation of franchise terms.
§ 108-9. Operation of cable system without franchise.

the purpose of operating or constructing a cable system and who does not
hold a valid franchise from the municipality shall be subject to all provisions
of this chapter, including but not limited to its provisions regarding
construction and technical standards and franchise fees. In its discretion,
the municipality at any time may require such person to apply for a

provided to the contrary in this chapter, the franchise agreement or
applicable law.
B. No course of dealing between a franchisee and the municipality, or any
delay on the part of the municipality in exercising any rights hereunder,
or any acquiescence by the municipality in the actions of a franchisee
which are in contravention of such rights, except to the extent such
rights are preempted by federal or state law or are expressly waived by
the municipality, or are expressly provided for in a franchise
agreement, shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the
municipality.

submitted, together with 12 copies. The application must be
accompanied by any required application filing fee as set forth in
§ 108-17, conform to any applicable request for proposals and contain
all required information. All applications shall include the names and
addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the applicant with
respect to the application.
C. All applications accepted for filing shall be made available by the
municipality for public inspection.
A. A person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting a request for
issuance of a request for proposals ("RFP") by the municipality. Upon
receipt of a request for an RFP, the municipality shall, if necessary,
commence a proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and
interests of the community and, upon completion of that proceeding,
shall promptly issue an RFP, which shall be mailed to the person
requesting its issuance and made available to any other interested
party.
B. The applicant shall respond to the RFP by filing an application within
the time directed by the municipality, providing the information and
material set forth in § 108-15. The procedures, instructions and
requirements set forth in the RFP shall be followed by each applicant.
The municipality or its designee may seek additional information from
any applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such
information.
C. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections A and B, a person may
apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application
containing the information required in § 108-15 and requesting an
evaluation of that application pursuant to Subsection D of this section.
Prior to evaluating that application, the municipality may conduct such
investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application
satisfies the standards set forth in Subsection D of this section and may
seek additional applications.
D. In evaluating an application for a franchise, the municipality shall
consider, among other things, the following factors:
§ 108-12 CABLE TELEVISION § 108-13
108:125
(1) The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with
the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable
franchise for any municipality.
(2) Whether the quality of the applicant's service under any existing
franchise in any municipality, including signal quality, response to
customer complaints, billing practices and the like, has been
reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities
served.
(3) Whether the applicant has the financial, technical and legal
qualifications to provide cable service.
(4) Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements
established by the municipality and is otherwise reasonable to
meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and
interests.
(5) Whether, to the extent not considered under Subsection D(4), the
applicant will provide adequate public, educational and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities or financial
support.
(6) Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-ofway
and private property that would be used by the cable system,
including the extent to which installation or maintenance as
planned would require replacement of property or involve
disruption of property, public services or use of the public rights-ofway;
the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of cable
systems to meet the cable-related needs and interests of the
community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of
competing applications.
(7) What effects a grant of the application may have on competition in
the delivery of cable service in the municipality.
E. If the municipality finds that it is in the public interest to issue a
franchise considering the factors set forth above, and subject to the
applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise agreement, it shall issue
a franchise. If the municipality denies a franchise, it will issue a written
decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding
whether or not to issue a franchise, the municipality may hold one or
more public hearings or implement other procedures under which
comments from the public on an application may be received. The
municipality also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on
its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject
any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP. This
chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any
applicant or existing franchisee standing to challenge the issuance of a
franchise to another.

limited to a demonstration that the applicant meets the following
criteria:
(a) The applicant must not have submitted an application for an
initial or renewal franchise to the municipality, which was
denied on the grounds that the applicant failed to propose a
cable system meeting the future cable-related needs and
interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to
such franchising decision were finally resolved adversely to the
applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the
application.

an opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be
inappropriate to deny it a franchise by virtue of the particular
circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by
the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent
their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's
principals or the remoteness of the matter from the operation
of cable systems.

subject to the supervision of the municipality or its designees, and in
strict compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations affecting the system.
B. A system, and all parts thereof, shall be subject to the right of periodic
inspection by the municipality.
C. No construction, reconstruction or relocation of a system or any part
thereof within the public rights-of-way shall be commenced until
written permits, where applicable, have been obtained from the proper
municipality officials. Such permits shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed and shall be issued in accordance with applicable ordinances
and codes of the municipality that apply to users of the municipality's
public rights-of-way. In any permit so issued, such officials may impose
such nondiscriminatory conditions and regulations as a condition of the
granting of the permit as are necessary for the purpose of protecting
any structures in the public rights-of-way and for the proper restoration
of such public rights-of-way and structures, and for the protection of the
public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
A. Should the grades or lines of the public rights-of-way that a franchisee
is authorized by franchise to use and occupy be changed at any time
during the term of a franchise, the franchisee shall, if necessary,
relocate or change its system so as to conform with the new grades or
lines.
B. Any alteration to the water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to
any municipality, state or other public structures in the public rights-ofway
that are required on account of the presence of a franchisee's
system in the public rights-of-way shall be made at the sole cost and
expense of the franchisee. During any work of constructing, operating
or maintaining of a system, a franchisee shall also protect any and all
existing.structures belonging to the municipality and any other person.
All work performed by the franchisee shall be done in the manner
prescribed by the municipality or other officials having jurisdiction
therein.

Nothing in this chapter or any franchise agreement shall be in preference
or hindrance to the right of the municipality and any board, authority,
commission or public service corporation to perform or carry on any public
works or public improvements of any description, and should a franchisee's
system in any way interfere with the construction, maintenance or repair
of such public works or public improvements, a franchisee shall protect
or relocate its system or part thereof as reasonably directed by any
municipality official, board, authority, commission or public service
corporation.

Consumer Protection
§ 108-23. Customer service obligations.
§ 108-24. Installations, connections and other franchisee services.
A. In addition to the provisions contained herein, a franchisee must
comply with the customer service obligations established by the FCC,
as may be amended from time to time, and which are set forth in
current form in Exhibit B44 and are incorporated herein by reference. In
addition, a franchisee shall at all times satisfy any additional or stricter
requirements established by a franchise agreement or other applicable
law or regulation.
B. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or prohibit the
municipality from waiving, for good cause, requirements established in
this article.
A. Standard installations. Except as federal rate regulations may
otherwise require, the franchisee shall not assess a subscriber any cost
other than a standard installation charge for service drops of 150 feet
or less, for a single outlet, unless the franchisee demonstrates to the
municipality's satisfaction that extraordinary circumstances justify a
higher charge.
B. Nonstandard installations. Except as applicable law may otherwise
require, where a drop exceeds 150 feet in length, a franchisee may
charge a subscriber for the franchisee's actual costs associated with
installing the longer drop, provided that drop length shall be the
shorter of: the actual length of the installed drop; or the shortest
distance to the point where the franchisee would be required to extend
its distribution system. The subscriber's preference as to the point of
entry into the residence shall be observed whenever feasible. Runs in
building interiors shall be as unobtrusive as possible. The franchisee
shall use due care in the process of installation and shall repair any
damage to the subscriber's property caused by said installation. Such
restoration shall be undertaken within no more than 30 days after the
damage is incurred and shall be completed as soon as possible
thereafter.
C. Location of drops. Except as federal rate regulations may otherwise
require, in any area where a franchisee would be entitled to install a
drop aboveground, the franchisee will provide the homeowner the
option, where feasible, to have the drop installed underground, if
requested, but may charge the homeowner the difference between the
actual cost of the aboveground installation and the actual cost of the
underground installation.

§ 108-25. Telephone and office availability.
D. Time for extension. Except as a franchise agreement may otherwise
require, where a franchisee is required under this section to provide
service to a person, it must provide such service: within 30 days of the
person's request if such person resides no further than 150 feet from
the franchisee's distribution system; or within 60 days if the person
resides more than 150 feet from the franchisee's distribution system,
provided that the person agrees to reimburse the franchisee for the
cost of installing such service in accordance with Subsection B above;
but the distribution system need not be extended for 1/4 mile or more to
provide service.
E. Deposits. A franchisee may require a reasonable, nondiscriminatory
deposit on equipment provided to subscribers, in addition to any
allowable monthly rental fees. Any subscriber deposit required by the
franchisee shall bear interest in accordance with applicable law or at
the going rate, which shall be not less than the prime rate of the bank
being used by the municipality for the conduct of ordinary business. All
deposits, with interest, shall be returned to the subscriber within six
months or when the equipment is returned at time of disconnection of
reception of service (whichever is sooner).
F. Antennas and antenna switches. A franchisee shall not, as a condition to
providing cable service, require any subscriber or potential subscriber
to remove any existing antenna structures for the receipt of over-the-air
television signals.
G. Delinquent accounts. A franchisee shall use its best efforts to collect on
delinquent subscriber accounts before terminating service. In all cases,
the franchisee shall provide the customer with at least 10 days' written
notice prior to disconnection.
A. Each franchisee shall maintain an office at a convenient location in the
municipality, or in the general geographical area which includes the
municipality, that shall be open during normal business hours to allow
subscribers to request service, pay bills and conduct other business.
B. Each franchisee will maintain at least one local, toll-free or collect-call
telephone access line which will be available to subscribers 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. Trained representatives of a franchisee shall be
available to respond to subscriber telephone inquiries during normal
business hours.
C. A franchisee must hire sufficient staff so that it can adequately respond
to customer inquiries, complaints and requests for service in its office,
over the phone and at the subscriber's residence.

§ 108-26. Scheduling and completing service.
In addition to the customer service standards contained in Exhibit B,45
all franchisees shall meet the following service standards, under normal
operating conditions, at least 95% of the time, as measured on a quarterly
basis:
§ 108-27. Interruptions of service.
A franchisee may intentionally interrupt service on the cable system only
for good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency
situations or as necessary to fix a service problem, only after a minimum of
48 hours' prior notice to subscribers and the municipality of the anticipated
A. Prompt service. Repairs for service interruptions and other system
repairs not requiring work within a subscriber's premises must be
begun within 24 hours after the subscriber reports the problem to the
franchisee or its representative or the interruption or need for repairs
otherwise becomes known to the franchisee. All such work must be
completed within three days from the date of the initial request, except
installation requests, or in the shortest time possible where, for reasons
beyond the franchisee's control, the work could not be completed
within three days even with the exercise of all due diligence; the failure
of a franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff shall
not justify a franchisee's failure to comply with this provision. Except as
federal law permits, no charge shall be made to the subscriber for this
service or for the cost of repairs to the franchisee's equipment or
facilities, except where it can be shown that the equipment or facility
was damaged by a subscriber.
B. Emergency maintenance. A franchisee shall keep an emergency system
maintenance and repair staff, capable of responding to and repairing
system malfunctions or interruptions, on a twenty-four-hour basis, and
shall respond to service interruptions 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, under normal operating conditions.
C. Other inquiries. Under normal operating conditions, requests for
service, repair and maintenance not involving service interruptions
must be acknowledged by a trained customer service representative
within 24 hours, or prior to the end of the next business day, whichever
is earlier. A franchisee shall respond to all other inquiries (including
billing inquiries) within five business days of the inquiry or complaint.
D. Mobility-limited subscribers. With regard to mobility-limited
subscribers, upon a subscriber request, each franchisee shall arrange
for pickup and/or replacement of converters or other franchisee
equipment at the subscriber's address or by a satisfactory equivalent
(such as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer).

service interruption; provided, however, that planned maintenance that
does not require more than two hours' interruption of service and that
occurs between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. shall not require
such notice to subscribers, but shall require notice to the municipality no
less than 24 hours prior to such an anticipated service interruption.
§ 108-28. Notice to subscribers.
§ 108-29. Billing.
A. In addition to the notification requirements contained within the
customer service standards in Exhibit B,46 a franchisee shall also
provide the following materials to each subscriber at the time cable
service is installed, at least annually thereafter, and at any time upon
request. Copies of all such subscriber materials shall also be provided
to the municipality, upon request.
(1) A schedule of rates and charges.
(2) A written description of the franchisee's delinquent subscriber
disconnect and reconnect procedures, and any other of its policies
applicable to its subscribers.
B. All promotional materials, announcements and advertising of
residential cable service to subscribers and the general public, where
price information is listed in any manner, shall clearly and accurately
disclose price terms. In the case of pay-per-view or pay-per-event
programming, all promotional materials must clearly and accurately
disclose price terms and, in the case of telephone orders, a franchisee
shall take appropriate steps to ensure that price terms are clearly and
accurately disclosed to potential subscribers before the order is
accepted.
C. Each franchisee shall maintain a public file containing all notices
provided to subscribers under these customer service standards.
Copies of all promotional or special offers made to subscribers shall be
filed promptly with the municipality, upon request.
A. A franchisee's first billing statement after a new installation or service
change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security
deposit.
B. A franchisee's billing statement must show a specific payment due date
not earlier than the midpoint of the period for which the service being
billed is rendered (e.g., the 15th day of a thirty-day billing cycle). Any
balance not received by seven days after the end of the period for which
the service being billed is rendered may be assessed a late fee as set
from time to time by resolution of the Board of Supervisors, or such
other amount as the municipality and the franchisee may agree,

consistent with state and local law. The late fee shall appear on the
following month's billing statement.47
C. A franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit
payment in person at the franchisee's business office and inform the
subscriber of the address of that office.
D. Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise be penalized
for any failure by a franchisee, including failure to timely or correctly
bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for a
payment timely made.
E. The account of any subscriber shall be credited a prorated share of the
monthly charge for the service upon the subscriber's prompt request,
or where the franchisee can reasonably identify the affected
subscribers, if said subscriber is without service or if service is
substantially impaired for any reason for a period exceeding four hours
during any twenty-four-hour period, except where it can be shown that
a subscriber seeks a refund for an outage or impairment which that
subscriber caused, or in the case of a planned outage occurring
between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m.
F. Except by reason of emergency, loss of programming signal, permanent
changes in programming or in the channel lineup on the system, or for
other legitimate and business reasons as permitted or required by
applicable law or programming contract, the franchisee shall not
deliberately interrupt the normal programming offered on the system to
subscribers without prior notification. Applicable federal or state law or
regulation shall govern whether subscribers are entitled to any refund
or credit for such interruptions.
A. A subscriber may terminate service at any time.
B. Upon request, a franchisee shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any
subscriber. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or
downgrade of service may be required of subscribers by any franchisee.
No charge may be imposed for any voluntary disconnection or
downgrade, except to the extent that federal law specifically provides
that the franchisee must be permitted so to charge a subscriber. So long
as the subscriber returns any equipment necessary to receive a service
within five business days of the disconnection, no charge may be
imposed by any franchisee for any cable service delivered 24 hours
prior to the return of such equipment. However, if a subscriber does not
return, or permit the franchisee to retrieve, such equipment within five
business days after disconnection, a franchisee may charge a
subscriber for any cable service delivered until the equipment is
returned.

§ 108-31. Parental control option.
A franchisee shall make available to any subscribers, upon request, the
option of blocking the video or audio portion of any channel or channels of
programming entering the subscriber's home. The control option described
herein shall be made available to all subscribers requesting it when any
cable service is provided, or reasonably soon thereafter.
C. Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be
refunded on disconnected accounts after any customer premises
equipment provided by the franchisee has been recovered by the
franchisee. The refund must be made within 30 days or by the end of
the next billing cycle, whichever is earlier, from the date disconnection
was requested (or, if later, the date on which any customer premises
equipment provided by the franchisee is returned).
D. If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber fee or other fee or
charge, a franchisee may disconnect the subscriber's service; however,
such disconnection shall not be effected until after 45 days from the
beginning of the period for which the service being billed is rendered,
plus at least 10 days' advance written notice to the subscriber in
question of intent to disconnect, given after the 45 days have elapsed. If
the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before the
date scheduled for disconnection, the franchisee shall not disconnect
service. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of
all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection
charge, if any, the franchisee shall promptly reinstate service.
E. A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber
is damaging or destroying the franchisee's cable system or equipment
and may pursue criminal or civil action against said subscriber as
appropriate. After disconnection, the franchisee shall restore service if
the subscriber provides adequate assurance, including monetary or
legal assurances, that it has ceased the practices that led to
disconnection, and paid all proper fees and charges, including any
reconnect fees and amounts owed the franchisee for damage to its
cable system or equipment.
F. A franchisee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes signal
leakage in excess of federal limits. Disconnection may be effected after
five days' written notice to the subscriber, if the subscriber fails to take
steps to correct the problem. In addition, a franchisee may disconnect a
subscriber without notice where signal leakage is detected originating
from the subscriber's premises in excess of federal limits, provided that
the franchisee shall immediately notify the subscriber of the problem
and, once the problem is corrected, reconnect the subscriber without
charge.
G. A franchisee shall reconnect service to customers wishing restoration
of service, provided that such a customer shall first satisfy any previous
obligations owed.

§ 108-33. Exclusive contracts and anticompetitive acts prohibited.
Except as authorized by federal or state law, no franchisee shall enter into
an exclusive contract for the provision of cable service with any person
(including but not limited to a building owner), or demand the exclusive
right to serve a person or location as a condition of providing or continuing
service.
A. A franchisee shall file annually with the municipality, in the franchisee's
annual report, a statement describing the extent of compliance with the
customer service standards contained in Exhibit B herein.48 If a
franchisee is in noncompliance with any element of such standards
during any calendar quarter, it shall include in its annual report a
description of such noncompliance, the reason for the noncompliance
and a remedial plan.
B. Subject to federal law, and after appropriate notice and a reasonable
period allowed for cure, a franchisee may be subject to penalties,
forfeitures and any other remedies or sanctions available under federal,
state or local law, including without limitation this chapter and a
franchisee's franchise agreement with the municipality, if it repeatedly
fails to comply with the standards herein.

Rate Regulation
§ 108-34. Regulation of rates by municipality.
The municipality reserves the right to regulate the rates and charges for
cable service to the maximum extent permitted by federal law or regulation.
Regardless of whether the municipality regulates rates for cable services,
a franchisee may not change its rates and charges unless it has first given
a minimum 30 calendar days' prior written notice of such change to the
municipality and to all subscribers.

§ 108-35. Findings.
The municipality finds that public rights-of-way of the municipality and state
to be used by a franchisee for the operation of a cable system are valuable
public property acquired and maintained by the state and municipality at
great expense to the taxpayers. The municipality further finds that the grant
of a franchise to use public rights-of-way is a valuable property right.
§ 108-36. Franchise fee not a tax or in lieu of any other tax or fee.
§ 108-37. Acceptance of payment not construed as accord or
satisfaction.
No acceptance of any payment by the municipality shall be construed as a
release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the municipality may have
for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under a franchise
agreement or for the performance of any other obligation of a franchisee.
A. Subject to federal law or regulation, payment of a franchise fee shall
not be considered in the nature of a tax or in lieu of other taxes or fees
imposed by the municipality.
B. The franchise fee shall be in addition to all other taxes and payments
that a franchisee may be required to pay under its franchise agreement,
any federal, state or local law, including any applicable amusement
taxes, except to the extent that such fees, taxes or assessments must be
treated as a franchise fee under 47 U.S.C. § 522.

each violation for each day the violation continues.
(5) For failure to comply with requirements for public, educational and
governmental use of the system: $100 per day for each violation for

§ 108-39. Remedies to be cumulative.
All remedies under this chapter and the franchise agreement are cumulative
unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not
foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment
of liquidated damages or penalties relieve a franchisee of its obligations to
comply with its franchise. Remedies may be used singly or in combination;
in addition, the municipality may exercise any rights it has at law or equity.
§ 108-40. Relation to insurance and indemnity requirements.
Recovery by the municipality of any amounts under insurance, a
performance bond or letter of credit, or otherwise, does not limit a
franchisee's duty to indemnify the municipality in any way; nor shall such
recovery relieve a franchisee of its obligations under a franchise or in any
respect prevent the municipality from exercising any other right or remedy
it may have.
(12) For any other violations: a fine of not more than $600, plus all court
costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the
township in the enforcement of this chapter.49
B. To the extent that penalties are applied to a franchisee under this
section, a franchisee shall not be subject to liquidated damages payable
to the municipality for the same violation.
C. The municipality may reduce or waive any of the above-listed penalties
for good cause shown.
D. Before the remedies specified herein may be applied, the municipality
shall first notify the franchisee, in writing, of the violation, and the
franchisee shall have 30 days, or such additional time as the
municipality shall specify, to cure the violation without penalty.
E. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having
jurisdiction over a franchisee shall not excuse the franchisee from the
performance of its obligations under this chapter or its franchise
agreement unless a stay is obtained from a forum of competent
jurisdiction.

Transfers
§ 108-41. Municipality's approval required.

Approval by the municipality of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute
a waiver or release of any of the rights of the municipality under this
chapter or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date
of the transfer.
A. A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and personal to
the original franchisee. A franchisee's obligations under this franchise
involve personal services whose performance involves personal credit,
trust and confidence in the franchisee, and transfer without the prior
written approval of the municipality shall be considered to impair the
municipality's assurance of due performance.
B. No transfer (including but not limited to transfer by forced or voluntary
sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or any other means) shall
occur without prior written notice to and approval of the municipality,
and only then upon such reasonable terms and conditions as relate to
the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee, as the
municipality deems necessary and proper, as provided for in a franchise
agreement and subject to federal law or regulation. The granting of
approval for a transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary
approval of any subsequent transfer.

Protection of Individuals' Rights
§ 108-43. Discriminatory practices prohibited.

Protection of subscriber privacy is mandatory. A franchisee shall at all times
protect the privacy of subscribers, consistent with Section 631 of the Cable
Act, 47 U.S.C. § 551, and other applicable federal, state and local laws.
A. A franchisee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, programmers or residents of the
municipality on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or
age.
B. A franchisee shall not discriminate among persons or take any
retaliatory action against a person because of that person's exercise of
any right it may have under federal, state or local law, nor may the
franchisee require a person to waive such rights as a condition of taking
service.
C. A franchisee shall not deny access or levy different rates and charges on
any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the
income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.
D. Subject to applicable law and except to the extent the municipality may
waive such a requirement, a franchisee is prohibited from
discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue
preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber or group of
subscribers or potential subscribers; provided, however, that a
franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in
order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are
offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers
throughout the municipality; and a franchisee may offer discounts for
the elderly, the handicapped, not-for-profit persons or organizations, or
the economically disadvantaged, and such other discounts as it is
expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if such discounts are
applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee shall comply
at all times with all applicable federal, state and municipality laws, and
all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination.
E. Information accessibility. Each document required to be maintained,
filed or submitted under the provisions of this chapter or a franchise
agreement, or by federal or state law or regulation, except those
designated as confidential by a franchisee, pursuant to applicable law,
is a public document, available for public inspection and copying at the
requester's expense, at the office of the municipality or a franchisee.

Subject to applicable law, it shall be unlawful for any person to make
any unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically,
inductively or otherwise, with any part of a franchisee's system within the
municipality for the purpose of enabling anyone to receive any services
of the system or gain profit thereby without authority of or payment to
the franchisee. Any such unlawful and unauthorized connection shall be
punishable as a misdemeanor of the first degree upon arrest by municipal
law enforcement agencies and conviction in municipal court.

General Provisions
§ 138-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 138-3. Applicability.
§ 138-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 138-5. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Township of Richland unless a permit

Floodplain Areas
§ 138-17. Identification.
§ 138-18. Description and special requirements.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Township of
Richland classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated June 19, 2012, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study; and
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Township of Richland and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area/District identified as floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified
in the FIS.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no
floodway has been delineated.
(1) In an AE Area/District without floodway, no new development shall
be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of all past and projected development will not increase the
BFE by more than one foot.
§ 138-17 FIRE PREVENTION § 138-18
134:189
§ 138-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board
of Richland Township Supervisors where studies or information provided
by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision.
However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after
the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify the
FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 138-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Richland Township Planning
Commission, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may
(2) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use,
or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development would not, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, increase the BFE more than one foot at
any point.
C. A Area/District.
(1) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
one-percent-annual-chance flood elevations have been provided.
For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other
federal, state, or other acceptable source shall be used when
available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
(2) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
D. The Shallow Flooding Area/District shall be those areas identified as
Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject
to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where
average depths are between one foot and three feet. In Zones AO and
AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around
and away from structures on slopes.

appeal to the Board of Supervisors of Richland Township. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 138-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary

§ 168-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this ordinance is to ensure that public health, safety and
welfare shall not be abridged by the making and creating of noise pollution
or of public nuisances from disturbing, excessive or offensive noises in the
Township. The residents of the Township recognize that uncontrolled noise
represents a danger to the health and welfare of their neighbors and that
each person in the community is entitled to live in an environment in which
the level of impulsive and amplified noise is minimized for the community
good. It is the purpose and scope of this chapter to provide regulations
defining the maximum sound levels that vehicles, appliances and equipment
shall be allowed to produce at specified distances from these devices, and
also to provide for the prohibition of other kinds of offensive noises. These
regulations and prohibitions are intended to protect the physical, mental
and social well-being of the residents of Richland Township.
§ 168-4. Legislative findings.
The Board of Supervisors finds that failure of individuals, businesses,
industries, persons maintaining animals, social gatherings and other
activities to regulate the noise emanating from their premises constitutes a
violation of the peace and enjoyment of the residents of the Township and a
public nuisance. Specifically, such noise emanating from home occupations,
businesses, industries, sound amplification equipment, radios, electronic
sound-recording equipment, vehicles, persons maintaining animals, social
gatherings, and other activities:

DECIBEL (dB)  A unit of sound level which is a division of a
logarithmic scale used to express the ration of sound pressure of the
source to the pressure of an arbitrarily chosen reference pressure;
the ratio is expressed on the decibel scale by multiplying its base 10
logarithm by 20.
EXCESSIVE NOISE  Excessive noise is that sound which is:
NIGHTTIME  Nine p.m. to 7:00 a.m., prevailing time; conversely,
daytime is 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., prevailing time.
NOISE  Any sound emitted by a person, animal, appliance,
equipment, instrument or other device.
NOISE LEVEL  Airborne sound levels expressed in dB and obtained
by the use of specific frequency-dependent weighting networks, as
specified in the reference standards and indicated by proper notation;
if all weighting is employed, the sound level is identified as dB(A).
NOISE POLLUTION  Noise of such loudness and character from a
single source or from multiple sources, which is or may be predicted
with reasonable certainty to be, injurious to health or which
unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of property or with any
lawful business or activity. Noise/sound pressure levels exceeding those
permitted in any district shall constitute noise pollution.
PERIOD OF OBSERVATION  The time interval during which
acoustical data are obtained. The period of observation is determined
by the characteristics of the noise being measured and the
instrumentation being used. The period of observation must be at least
as long as the response time of the instrumentation. The greater the
variance in individual sound level, the longer must be the observation
time for a given expected accuracy of measurement.
PERSON  Includes an individual, firm, association, organization,
partnership, trust, company, corporation or any other similar entity.
SOUND LEVEL  Noise level.
SOUND LEVEL METER  An instrument or combination of instruments
which meets or exceeds the requirements for an ANSI Type SIA or Type
S2A sound level meter.

General Provisions
§ 198-95. Purpose and policy.
This Part 5 sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection system of Richland Township
and the treatment system for the City of Johnstown and its suburbs and
enables the owner of the treatment system to comply with all applicable
state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the
General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403).
§ 198-96. Definitions and word usage.
A. The objectives of this Part 5 are:
(1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipality
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the
system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or
otherwise be incompatible with the system;
(3) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system; and
(4) To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system.
B. This Part 5 provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance
of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of
general requirements for the other users; authorizes monitoring and
enforcement activities; requires user reporting; assumes that existing
customers' capacity will not be preempted; and provides for the setting
of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program
established herein.
C. This Part 5 shall apply to the City of Johnstown and to persons outside
the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the
city publicly owned treatment works (POTW). Except as otherwise

(15) All wastewater entering the sanitary sewer system shall be
pretreated to typical domestic levels unless otherwise stated in
writing by the POTW by way of a wastewater discharge permit.
Typical domestic levels and specific pollutant limitations may
become necessary periodically due to changing NPDES
requirements, required reevaluations of the local limits analysis or
other reasons. At such times that it becomes necessary, modified
local limits will be established and formally adopted by the POTW
after the modifications have been approved by the Approval
Authority (USEPA). After formal adoption by the POTW, the new
modifications become automatic in this Pretreatment Ordinance. A
revised Appendix A103 will be issued by the POTW for inclusion in
§ 198-98 RICHLAND CODE § 198-98
192:320
§ 198-99. Promulgation of federal pretreatment standards.
Upon the promulgation of federal categorical pretreatment standards for
a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent
than limitations imposed under this Part 5 for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this Part 5. The
Director of the Bureau of Sewage shall notify all affected users of the
applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR Section 403.12 and of any
new or revised categorical standards as promulgated by the EPA.
§ 198-100. Modification of federal pretreatment standards.
Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal
of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply
to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the
amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the
wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent
which is achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken when
measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of
Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403, General Pretreatment
Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution, promulgated
pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in
the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR
Part 403, Section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval
authority is obtained.
this Pretreatment Ordinance as a replacement. No formal adoption
process by this governmental body is necessary for the new specific
pollutant limitations to become effective and part of this
Pretreatment Ordinance. [Amended 9-25-2000 by Ord. No. 274]
(16) Pollutants which result in the presence of the toxic gases, vapors or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems.
(17) Any trucked or hauled wastes without prior approval of the POTW,
and at the discharge point designed by the POTW.
B. When the Director determines that a user(s) is contributing to the
POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, the superintendent shall
advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW, and
develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the interference
with the POTW. The contributing municipality shall be advised of any
such actions taken or contemplated.

State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case
where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or
those in this Part 5.
§ 198-102. City's right of revision.
The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal
system if deemed necessary to comply with the objective presented in
§ 198-95 of this Part 5.
§ 198-103. Excessive discharge.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutantspecific
limitation developed by the city or state. (Comment: Dilution may
be an acceptable means of complying with some of the prohibitions set forth
in § 198-98, e.g., the pH prohibition; use of dilution must be approved in
advance by the Director of the POTW.)
§ 198-104. Accidental discharges.
A. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Part 5.

provide this protection shall be submitted to the POTW operator for
review, and shall be approved by the POTW operator before
construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan
by January 1, 1987. No user who commences contribution to the POTW
after the effective date of this Part 5 shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have
been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this Part 5. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is
the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the
POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective
actions.
B. Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the
user shall submit to the contributing municipality and the Director of
the POTW a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any

Part 5. It shall be unlawful for an existing user of the POTW to change
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person
or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other
applicable law.
C. Notice to employees: A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that
all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to
occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

192:325
municipality may make recommendations in detail wherein public
necessity, convenience and general welfare do or do not justify the
grant of the permit. If the contributing municipality fails to file
such recommendations, it shall be presumed that the contributing
municipality has no objections to the grant of the permit. In any
event, the recommendations of the contributing municipality shall
be regarded as advisory in nature and shall not be binding on the
POTW.
(3) The POTW operator will evaluate the data furnished by the user
and may require additional information. After evaluation and
acceptance of the data furnished, the city may issue a wastewater
contribution permit subject to terms and conditions provided
herein.
C. Permit modifications. Within three months of the promulgation of a
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the wastewater
contribution permit of users subject to such standards shall be revised
to require compliance with such standard within the time frame
prescribed by such standard. Where a user, subject to a National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted an
application for a wastewater contribution permit as required by
Subsection B, the user shall apply for a wastewater contribution permit
within 90 days after the promulgation of the applicable National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard. In addition, the user with an
existing wastewater contribution permit shall submit to the Director of
the Bureau of Sewage and the contributing municipality within 90 days
after the promulgation of an applicable federal categorical
pretreatment standard the information required by Subsection B(1)(h)

municipality shall be notified of such transfer by the user.
A. Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a
new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards
and requirements shall submit to the Director a report indicating the
nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the
regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and
requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these
process units in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment
standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a
§ 198-107 RENTAL OCCUPANCY REPORTS § 198-108
192:327
consistent basis and, if not, what additional O & M and/or pretreatment
is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and
certified to by a qualified professional.
B. Periodic compliance reports.
(1) Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance
date of such pretreatment standards, or, in the case of a new
source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall
submit biannual reports to the Director, unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Director of the
Bureau of Sewage, indicating the nature, concentration and flow of
the pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. All significant noncategorical industrial
users are also required to submit such biannual reports detailing
the nature, concentration and flow of pollutants that are outlined in
their wastewater discharge permits and the City of Johnstown local
discharge limits, Section 1042.16(e)(14), Ordinance No. 4537. All
baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance reports or
biannual status reports on continued compliance must be signed by
a duly authorized representative of the industrial user and must
include the certification statement set forth in CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii).
(2) The Director may impose mass limitations on users which are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by
Subsection B(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of
the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass, where requested by the Director, of
pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be
prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis
shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by
the Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any
other test procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling
shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by
the Administrator. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a
sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the EPA publication Sampling and Analysis
Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority
Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator.
§ 198-108 RICHLAND CODE § 198-108
192:328
§ 198-109. Monitoring facilities.
(3) All analyses of sewage effluent performed by or on behalf of any
industrial user of the system must be reported in writing to the
Director of the Bureau of Sewage.
(4) Notification.
(a) All industrial users shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional
Waste Management Division Director, and Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) Hazardous
Waste Authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261, and detail the name, hazardous waste number
and type of discharge. If the discharge is greater than 100 kg
per calendar month, the industrial user shall also make known
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, and
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month
and during the following 12 months.
(b) All notifications must take place within 180 days of
promulgation of 40 CFR 403.12, or, in the case of new
discharges, within 180 days after the discharge of the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. Any
changed discharges must be promptly brought to the attention
of the POTW. Discharges of less than 15 kg of hazardous
wastes per calendar month are exempt from reporting
requirements, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharges of
more than 15 kg of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month or of any quantity of acute hazardous waste requires a
one-time notification. Any industrial user that requires
notification under this section shall certify that it has a
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.
A. The POTW operator may require to be provided and operated, at the
user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling
and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the
user's premises, but the operator may, when such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, with the concurrence
by resolution of the geographic municipality, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
B. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
§ 198-108 RENTAL OCCUPANCY REPORTS § 198-109
192:329
§ 198-110. Inspection and sampling.
The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purposes of this Part 5 are being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the city or their representative ready
access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes
of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any
of their duties. The city, approval authority and, where the state is the
approval authority, the EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspections,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations, and shall have the right
to copy records and reports of the industrial users. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that, upon presentation of
suitable identification, personnel from the city, contributing municipality,
approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for
the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. The contributing
municipality shall designate an employee or officer to be notified in the
event of inspections within the contributing municipality.
§ 198-111. Compliance with pretreatment standards.
facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the
user.
C. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the POTW
operator's requirements and all applicable local construction standards
and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days
following written notification by the POTW operator.
A. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this Part 5 and shall achieve compliance with all federal
categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations
specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall
be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the city under this Part 5. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or methods of operation shall be
reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of
the changes.
§ 198-109 RICHLAND CODE § 198-111
192:330
B. The city shall annually publish in the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat
newspaper a list of industrial users which, at any time during the
previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
pretreatment requirements. An industrial user is in significant
noncompliance if its violations meet one or more of the following
criteria:
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, in which 66% or
more of all of the measurements taken during a six-month period
exceed the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same
pollutant parameter.
(2) Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, in which 33% or more of
all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during
a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
TRC (TRC equals 1.4 for BOC, TSS, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all
other pollutants except pH).
(3) Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit that the city
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass-through (including endangering
the health of the City of Johnstown's wastewater treatment plant's
personnel or the general public).
(4) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or
has resulted in the City of Johnstown's exercise of its emergency
authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
(5) Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control
mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction,
completing construction or attaining final compliance.
(6) Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance
reports, ninety-day self-monitoring reports and reports on
compliance with compliance schedules.
(7) Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
(8) Any other violation which the city determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the pretreatment program.
C. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the EPA or the approval authority upon
request.

state and federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked in
accordance with the procedures of §§ 198-113 through 198-117 of this Part
5:
A. The POTW operator may suspend the wastewater treatment service
and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the POTW operator, in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or
causes the POTW operator to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
Upon such action, the POTW operator shall immediately notify the
contributing municipality.
B. Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person
to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW operator
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW
operator shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the
wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the
user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to
the POTW operator and the contributing municipality within 15 days of
the date of occurrence.
A. Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his discharge;

§ 198-126. Specific pollutant limitations.
All wastewater entering the sanitary sewage system shall be pretreated
to typical domestic levels unless otherwise stated, in writing, by the JRS
by way of a significant industrial user permit or other permit. Typical
domestic levels shall be documented in a set of local limits for pollutants,
capable of effecting efficient operation of the sewage treatment plant, in the
Rates, Rules and regulations, Appendix B,105 in a format as attached hereto.
Typical domestic levels and specific pollutant limitations may be changed
periodically due to changing NPDES requirements, changes in the overall
characteristics of waste throughout the system, required reevaluations of
the local limits analysis or other reasons. At such times that it becomes
necessary, modified local limits will be established and formally adopted by
the JRS. Such revision shall only be implemented after the modifications
have been reviewed and determined to be acceptable by the approval
authority (USEPA). Revised pretreatment program local discharge limits
will be issued as Appendix B to the applicable rules and issued to all
municipalities.

General Provisions
§ 210-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Richland Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 210-2. Statement of findings.
The Board of Supervisors of Richland Township finds that:
§ 210-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 210-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood-control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
Commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.

the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the one-hundred-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the
boundary of the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance
studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies
have defined the boundary of the one-hundred-year floodway, it is
assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends
from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.

provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group
classification. The soils in the area of the development site may be
identified from a soil survey report that can be obtained from local
NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious
as the HSG varies from A to D (NOTE: NRCS; see § 210-47C and D).

Stormwater Management Standards
§ 210-8. General requirements.
A. For all regulated activities, unless preparation of an SWM site plan is
specifically exempted in § 210-9:
(1) Preparation and implementation of an approved SWM site plan is
required.
(2) No regulated activities shall commence until the municipality
issues written approval of an SWM site plan, which demonstrates
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
B. SWM site plans approved by Richland Township, in accordance with
§ 210-17, shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated
activity.
C. The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve measures
for meeting the state water quality requirements other than those in
this chapter, provided that they meet the minimum requirements of,
and do not conflict with, state law, including but not limited to the Clean
Streams Law.
D. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and
maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g.,
during construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this
chapter and to meet all requirements under the Pennsylvania Code Title
25 and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs and their design
standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual (E&S Manual), Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
Department of Environmental Protection, No. 363- 2134-008 (2000), as
amended and updated.
E. For all regulated activities, implementation of the volume controls in
§ 210-10 is required with the exception of regulated activities that meet
the exemption criteria found in § 210-9A of this chapter.
F. Impervious areas:
(1) The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages.
(2) For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this chapter.
(3) For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
chapter.
§ 210-8 SOLID WASTE § 210-8
207:383
G. Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
permission of the adjacent property owner(s). Such stormwater flows
shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.
H. All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
(1) Protect health, safety, and property;
(2) Meet state water quality requirements as defined in Article II;
(3) Meet the water quality goals of this chapter by implementing
measures to:
(a) Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, natural slopes
over 8%, and existing native vegetation.
(b) Preserve and maintain trees and woodlands. Maintain or
extend riparian buffers and protect existing forested buffer.
Provide trees and woodlands adjacent to impervious areas
whenever feasible.
(c) Establish and maintain nonerosive flow conditions in natural
flow pathways.
(d) Minimize soil disturbance and soil compaction. Over disturbed
areas, replace topsoil to a minimum depth equal to the original
depth or four inches, whichever is greater. Use tracked
equipment for grading when feasible.
(e) Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious
areas, wherever possible.
(4) To the maximum extent practicable, incorporate the techniques for
low-impact development practices described in "The Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual" (SWM Manual)
(NOTE: See § 210-47A.).
I. Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this chapter.
J. Storage facilities should completely drain both the volume control and
rate control capacities over a period of time not less than 24 and not
more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm.
K. For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and
requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under
Pennsylvania Code Title 25, the Clean Streams Law, and the
Stormwater Management Act.
L. The design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge should be obtained from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of
§ 210-8 RICHLAND CODE § 210-8
207:384
the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, U.S. Department of Commerce,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National
Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver
Spring, Maryland 20910. NOAA's Atlas 14 can be accessed at Internet
address http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
M. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the SWM Manual.
(NOTE: See § 210-47A.)
N. The applicant may meet the rate controls criteria in § 210-11 through
off-site stormwater management measures as long as the proposed
measures are in the same subwatershed. Off-site stormwater control
measures may only be sought if it is shown that on-site stormwater
control measures cannot be physically accomplished. This does not
relieve the applicant from meeting the volume controls criteria in
§ 210-10 on site.
O. Where a development is traversed by watercourses, drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall conform to the stream
buffer requirements. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes
through the site, the applicant shall create a stream buffer extending a
minimum of 50 feet to either side of the top-of-bank of the channel. The
buffer area shall be maintained with and encouraged to use appropriate
native vegetation (reference to Appendix H of Pennsylvania Handbook
of Best Management Practices for Developing Area for plant lists). If
the applicable rear or side yard setback is less than 50 feet, the buffer
width may be reduced to 25% of the setback to a minimum of 10 feet. If
an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant, easement,
etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the existing buffer
shall be maintained. This does not include lakes or wetlands.
P. Roof drains should not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm
sewers or roadside ditches to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where it is advantageous to do so. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
it shall be permitted on a case-by-case basis by Richland Township.
Q. No regulated earth disturbance activities within Richland Township
shall commence until the requirements of the chapter are met.
R. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated activities or
regulated earth disturbance from DEP, Cambria County Conservation
District and PA DOT must be provided.
S. Water shall not be stored on a roof. Water stored on parking areas and
drive areas shall not exceed five inches in depth as measured from the
basin bottom to the emergency spillway crest.
T. Storage must be open and accessible for visual inspection. Where
underground detention is provided manhole/inlet access must be
provided to allow visual inspection.
§ 210-8 SOLID WASTE § 210-8
207:385
§ 210-9. Exemptions.
U. Provide a four-foot-height fence around surface detention basins where
two feet or more of water depth is stored measured from the pond
bottom to the crest of the emergency spillway.
V. Where a detention basin is to be turned over to Richland Township, the
following apply:
(1) Property shall be granted to Richland Township in fee simple;
(2) Access shall be granted to Richland Township in fee simple;
(3) Access shall be a twelve-foot-wide gravel all-weather roadway that
is seeded with lawn vegetation on a twenty-foot-wide access area;
(4) Provide a six-foot-height vinyl-clad chain-link fence with twelvefoot-
wide access gate aligned with gravel access roadway;
(5) Basin slopes shall have gradual slopes that are machine mowable;
(6) Basin shall have access ramp for mobile equipment that aligns with
twelve-foot-wide access gate;
(7) Developer shall provide a maintenance fee as established by
Richland Township by resolution to assist with future maintenance
costs.
A. Exemptions:
(1) Regulated activities that create disconnected impervious areas
smaller than 500 square feet are exempt from all requirements in
this chapter.
(2) Regulated activities that create disconnected impervious areas
equal to or greater than 500 square feet and less than 5,000 square
feet are exempt from the peak rate control and the SWM site plan
preparation requirement of this chapter but should comply with the
small project requirements found in Appendix F of the chapter.139
(3) Regulated activities that create disconnected impervious areas
equal to or greater than 5,000 square feet and less than 10,000
square feet are exempt only from the peak rate control requirement
of this chapter.
(4) Agricultural activity is exempt from the rate control and SWM site
plan preparation requirements of this chapter, provided that the
activities are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 102.
(5) Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the
rate control and SWM site plan preparation requirements of this
139. Editor's Note: Appendix F is included at the end of this chapter.

207:386
§ 210-10. Volume controls.
chapter, provided that the activities are performed according to the
requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
B. Additional exemption criteria.
(1) Exemption responsibilities. An exemption shall not relieve the
applicant from implementing such measures as are necessary to
protect public health, safety, and property.
(2) HQ and EV streams. An exemption shall not relieve the applicant
from meeting the special requirements for watersheds draining to
identified high quality (HQ) or exceptional value (EV) waters and
source water protection areas (SWPA) and requirements for
nonstructural project design sequencing.
(3) Drainage problems. If a drainage problem is documented or known
to exist downstream of or is expected from the proposed activity,
then the municipality may require the applicant to comply with the
chapter.
(4) Even though the developer is exempt, he is not relieved from
complying with other regulations.
C. Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 210-8D through K.
A. The low-impact development practices provided in the SWM Manual
(NOTE: See § 210-47A.) shall be utilized for all regulated activities to
the maximum extent practicable.
B. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm
Method in Subsection B(1) or the Simplified Method in Subsection B(2)
below. For regulated activities that create 10,000 square feet or less of
impervious cover that do not require hydrologic routing to design the
stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no preference for either
methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology
on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on
applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each
methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the SWM Manual [NOTE: See
§ 210-47A.]) is applicable to any size of regulated activity. This
method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for
all storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(b) For modeling purposes:
§ 210-9 SOLID WASTE § 210-10
207:387
§ 210-11. Rate controls.
The post-development peak discharge rates will follow the applicable
approved management district or release rate map for the two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year storms. The approved stormwater
management release district maps for the Little Connemaugh River and the
Stonycreek River watersheds are found in Appendix D.140 The stormwater
management subarea for the Little Conemaugh River watershed is found
in Table 1. The stormwater management district criteria for the Stonycreek
River watershed is found in Table 2. For any areas not shown on the release
rate maps or management district maps, the post-development discharge
rates shall not exceed the pre-development discharge rates.
[1] Existing (pre-development) nonforested pervious areas
must be considered meadow or its equivalent.
[2] Five percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in the model for existing
conditions.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the SWM Manual [NOTE: See
§ 210-47A.]) provided below is independent of site conditions and
should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This
method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than 10,000
square feet or for projects that require design of stormwater
storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow
(i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth). Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 210-11, Rate
controls.

A. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site.
B. Any stormwater management facility designed to store runoff and
requiring a berm or earthen embankment shall be designed to provide a
concrete lined emergency spillway to safely pass the one-hundred-year
§ 210-11 SOLID WASTE § 210-11
207:389
post-development flow plus be provided with one foot of freeboard.
Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, design shall comply with the Chapter
105 requirements.
C. Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges,
stream enclosures, outfalls) and any work involving wetlands shall
conform to PADEP Chapter 105. Design shall provide one foot freeboard
measured below the lowest point along the top of the roadway.
D. Drainage conveyance facilities (storm sewers and channels) not falling
under PADEP Chapter 105 must be able to convey post-development
runoff from a twenty-five-year design storm without surcharging the
facilities.
E. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels
and at all points of discharge.
F. Calculation methodology. Stormwater runoff from all development sites
shall be calculated using either the Rational Method or a soil cover
complex methodology.
(1) Any stormwater runoff calculations shall use generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover complex
method. Table 3 summarizes acceptable computation methods. It is
assumed that all methods will be selected by the design
professional based on the individual limitations and suitability of
each method for a particular site. Richland Township may allow the
use of the Rational Method to estimate peak discharges from
drainage areas that contain less than five acres. The Soil Complex
Method is required for drainage areas greater than five acres.

(2) All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths
for the various return period storms according to the region for
which they are located as presented in Table C-1 in Appendix C of
this chapter.141 If a hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or
HEC-1 is used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration
of rainfall shall be 24 hours. The Alternating Block Method, shown
in Figure C-1, Appendix C, of this chapter shall be used for the
rainfall distribution.
(3) For the purposes of existing conditions flow rate determination,
undeveloped land shall be considered as "meadow" in good
condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve
number or Rational "C" value (i.e., forest), as listed in Table C-2 or
C-3 in Appendix C of this document.
(4) All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for
overland flow and return periods from the design storm curves
from Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Rainfall
Curves (1986) (Figures C-2 to C-4).142 Times of concentration for
overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented
in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS,
TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by NRCS). Times
of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's equation.

conditions to be used in the soil cover complex method shall be
obtained from Table C-2 in Appendix C of this chapter.
(6) Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for
use in the Rational method shall be obtained from Table C-3 in
Appendix C of this chapter.
(7) Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of
open channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's
roughness coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table C-4 in
Appendix C of the chapter.
(8) Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using
any generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
(9) The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by
routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using
the Storage-Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than
200 acres in size, the design storm hydrograph shall be computed
using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.
Richland Township may approve the use of any generally accepted
full hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total
runoff volume that is consistent with the volume from a method
that produces a full hydrograph.

Except as modified by the express language appearing elsewhere in this
Part 2, the following provisions and specifications shall apply to the
occupancy of township right-of-way:
A. The work authorized by this permit shall be done at such time and in
such a manner as shall be consistent with the safety of the public and
shall conform to all requirements and standards of the township or
current Pennsylvania Department of Transportation specifications,
where applicable. If at any time it shall be found by the township that
the work is not being done or has not been properly performed, the
permittee and/or its contractor, upon being notified in writing by the
township, shall immediately take the necessary steps, at its own
expense, toward placing the work in condition to conform to said
requirements or standards.
B. In the event of willful failure or neglect by said permittee and/or its
contractor or their employees to perform and comply with the
conditions, restrictions and provisions of this permit, the township may
revoke and annul this permit and order and direct said permittee and/or
its contractor to remove any or all structures or property belonging to
said permittee and/or its contractor from the legal limits of the highway
right-of-way and to restore the highway right-of-way to its former
condition.
C. If work is stopped on a project for any reason, and any ditch or trench,
in the opinion of the township, remains open for an unreasonable
period, the permittee and/or its contractor, if so directed, shall refill the
ditch or trench, and work shall not be resumed thereon until the
permittee and/or its contractor is prepared to proceed with the work
until completion. In the event that the permittee and/or its contractor
fails to refill the ditch or trench or proceed until completion of the work
upon notice from the township to do so, the township may perform the
necessary and required work subject to reimbursement by the
permittee and/or its contractor.
D. The permittee shall pay all costs and expenses incident to or growing
out of the project, including the prescribed fees for the same, the cost of
making and maintaining the temporary restoration of the disturbed
areas and making permanent restoration and, further, shall reimburse
the township for any inspection costs which the township may deem it
necessary to incur, and the permittee shall reimburse the township for
said costs within 30 days after receipt of the statement setting forth
sums expended therefor by the township.
E. If the permittee and/or its contractor, after making an opening in the
highway to place or repair pipe or for any other purpose, fails to restore
§ 212-13 SOLID WASTE § 212-13
207:427
any portion of highway right-of-way to conform with specifications of
the township, the township reserves the right to do the work and bill
the permittee for the cost of the restoration.
F. The permittee will submit to the township a certificate or certificates of
insurance for public liability and property damage, in sufficient
amounts to cover any loss, that may be incurred for or on account of any
matter, cause or thing arising out of the construction, reconstruction,
repair, relocation or installation of the permitted facilities, except in
those instances where the township by prior arrangement has
authorized the permittee to provide other means of protecting the
township and its employees.
G. The permission herein granted does not relieve the permittee and/or its
contractor from obtaining any consent otherwise required from the
owner or owners of the abutting property and does not confer upon the
permittee and/or its contractor the right to cut, remove or destroy trees
or shrubbery within the legal limits of the highway except under such
conditions, restrictions and regulations as the township may prescribe.
H. If at any time the structure or facility shall become a hazard from any
cause whatsoever, the permittee and/or its contractor shall have the
same removed or repaired within 48 hours after receipt of written
notification, except at times of extraordinary happenings when
extension of such time limit may be given by the township.
I. After each and every excavation made by the permittee and/or its
contractor in any road or highway right-of-way covered by this permit
incident to the erection, repair, resetting or removal of any poles,
manholes, conduits, water, steam, oil, gas pipes, sewers or any other
obstructions or construction, said permittee and/or its contractor shall,
under the supervision and direction of the township, restore the road to
a condition conforming to requirements and/or specification of the

highway right-of-way, the permittee and/or its contractor shall maintain
and keep in good order and repair said structures and appliances. The
permittee covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and save harmless
the township of and from all liability for damages or injury occurring to
any person or persons or property at or on said roads through or in
consequence of any act or omission of any contractor, agent, servant,
employee or person engaged or employed in, about or upon said work,
by, at the instance or with the approval or consent of the permittee, or
from the failure of the permittee and/or its contractor to comply with
the provisions set forth herein.
J. If at any time in the future the highway is widened or the alignment or
grades are changed, the permittee further agrees to change or relocate
any part of the structures covered by this permit which interferes with
the improvement of the highway, at its own expense, to the extent now
or hereafter required by law.

township to do such work as may be deemed necessary to correct the
existing emergency conditions.

restrictions and provisions of this permit, which shall govern all

structures, or property and appurtenances thereto belonging, erected
on or in the highway right-of-way.

operation in such a manner as to be visible to the traveling public
and meet the requirements of the township. These signs shall
display the name of the permittee and/or its contractor on the back
of the sign. Special employees shall be assigned by the permittee
and/or its contractor to direct traffic when it becomes necessary to
limit it to one way. Advance permission must be obtained from

amended.
A. Any opening or impairment of any nature whatsoever of any improved
surface within the township right-of-way as authorized by township
permit of any kind shall be made in accordance with the following
specified provisions:

specified on the permit. The plate or bridging is to be extended a
minimum of 18 inches on either side of the opening and tied into
the existing cartway.

repairs within the improved surface of township highways. It shall
§ 212-13 RICHLAND CODE § 212-14
207:430
be placed at the nearest edge of the cut closest to the edge of the
improved surface and shown on plans attached to the application.
(3) The permittee is responsible for all costs and expenses of making
and maintaining temporary or permanent restorations of disturbed
areas. When permanent restoration is made, the permittee shall be
responsible for such areas for any subsequent failure of the
highway surface during a period of two years following completion
of the permanent restoration work.
B. No openings for the purpose of placing pipe lines or other structures
under the improved surface of the road or highway by drilling, boring,
driving or tunneling shall be made closer than three feet to the edge of
the road pavement, and trenches for conduits, water, steam, oil, gas
pipes, sewers and other obstructions placed parallel with the road or
highway shall be dug so that the near edge of the trench is at least three
feet outside of the edge of the road pavement with a minimum depth of
three feet below the surface of the road or highway, unless the township

the shoulder of a township highway for the utility.
E. In case it is necessary to cross under any improved road or highway, the
opening for a pipe line shall be drilled, bored or driven on a horizontal
plane at a minimum depth of three feet below the surface of the road or
highway. Trenching will be authorized by the township, in writing,
where drilling, boring or driving the proposed structure beneath the
township road is determined not to be feasible. Where necessary to
cross the improved road or highway by trenching, the crossing shall be
made under 1/2 of the improved road width and the pipe or structure
placed and the hole carefully backfilled in accordance with the
applicable restoration detail.148 The second half of the trenching is to be
completed in the same manner, so at least one-way traffic will be
maintained over 1/2 the improved road or highway while the second
half is being trenched.
F. Where a tile drain or other structure or facility is encountered, it shall
be replaced or restored by the permittee and/or its contractor in

the legal limits of the highway. All parts of the highway and various
structures disturbed shall be restored to a condition equal to that which
existed before starting the work. Guard rails shall be replaced to the
present alignment, and any guard posts discolored through the work of
the permittee and/or its contractor shall be refinished by washing or

other ground-mounted utility appurtenances shall be placed at least 30
feet from the edge of the traveled roadway where sufficient right-of-way

be placed as near to the right-of-way line as possible. No poles or other
overhead structures shall be placed where they will obstruct the view of
traffic on the highway, nor within five feet of any warning or direction
sign, unless specifically permitted in writing.
B. All wires except power transmission and supply lines, appurtenances or
supports attached to poles which cross the highway shall be placed or
erected so as to provide a minimum vertical clearance of 18 feet within
right-of-way limits of highway. Where power transmission and supply
lines cross over a highway in urban and rural areas, vertical clearance
and other requirements of the National Electrical Safety Code must be
complied with. All guys shall be placed so as to avoid interference with
traffic of all kinds on the highway and must present a neat appearance
when installed; if for electric light or power lines, they must be

subdivision or land development after the effective date of enactment of this
chapter.
§ 215-8. Existing subdivisions and land developments.
The ordinance of 1991 and any subsequent amendments shall affect plats
as follows:
A. From the time an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary
or final, is duly filed as provided in the subdivision and land
development ordinance, and while such application is pending approval
or disapproval, no change or amendment of the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall affect the decision on such
application adversely to the applicant and the applicant shall be
entitled to a decision in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was duly
filed. In addition, when a preliminary application has been duly
approved, the applicant shall be entitled to final approval in accordance
with the terms of the approved preliminary application as hereinafter
provided. However, if an application is properly and finally denied, any
subsequent application shall be subject to the intervening change in
governing regulations.
B. When an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or final,
has been approved without conditions or approved by the applicant's
acceptance of conditions, no subsequent change or amendment in the

§ 215-5 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 215-8
215:461
applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence and
to complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance
with the terms of such approval within five years from such approval.
C. Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid
five-year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary
approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary
approval, the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of
the governing ordinances or plans as they stood at the time when the

improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by
the landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed
sections as well as deadlines within which applications for final plat
approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be
updated annually by the applicant on or before the anniversary of the
preliminary plat approval, until final plat approval of the final section

percentage is approved by the Board of Supervisors in its discretion.
Provided that the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or
violated any of the conditions of the preliminary plat approval,
including compliance with landowner's aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plats for the various sections, then the aforesaid
protections afforded by substantially completing the improvements
depicted upon the final plat within five years shall apply and for any
section or sections, beyond the initial section, in which the required
improvements have not been substantially completed within said fiveyear
period the aforesaid protections shall apply for an additional term
or terms of three years from the date of final plat approval for each
section.
G. Failure of landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of submission
of final plats for the various sections shall subject any such section to
any and all changes in zoning, subdivision and other governing
ordinance enacted by the township subsequent to the date of the initial
preliminary plan submission.

which is situate in the township, may request a conference with the
Planning Commission for the purpose of discussing or reviewing such
proposed subdivision or land development.
§ 215-13. Preliminary review of plan.
All applications for township approval of subdivision and land development
plans shall commence with the official submission of a plan and all required
supplementary data to the Township Secretary. All applications for
preliminary review of a plan shall be acted upon by the township within
such time limits as established in this chapter, provided that the Board of
Supervisors shall render its decision and communicate it to the applicant
not later than 90 days after the date of the next regular meeting of the
Planning Commission following the date the application is filed, provided
that should said next regular meeting occur more than 30 days following
the filing of the application, said ninety-day period shall be measured from
the 13th day following the day the application was filed. At any time during
the review process, the applicant may substitute an amended plan for that
A. The preapplication conference shall not be mandatory and shall not be
regarded as formal application for subdivision or land development.
The filing of any report, sketch plan, plat or map prior to or at such
conference shall not constitute submission of a plan or application for
land development or subdivision.
B. Any report, sketch plan, plat or map to be considered by the Planning
Commission at such conference shall be provided by the potential
applicant in three copies and the Township Secretary shall distribute a
copy of the same to the Township Planning Commission and the
Township Engineer or township representative for information
purposes only.
C. The Planning Commission may, at its sole discretion, make or refuse to
make recommendations as the result of the preapplication conference.
Any recommendations made by the Planning Commission at or in
response to the preapplication conference shall not be binding upon the
Planning Commission in its review of the plan after formal application.
§ 215-11 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 215-13
215:465
originally submitted solely for the purpose of correcting the original plan to
the extent necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
A. A plan shall be deemed to have been submitted for preliminary review
when the applicant has furnished to the Township Secretary the
following documents:
(1) One copy of a completed application for subdivision or land
development, plus payment of all application fees.
(2) Five copies, black (or blue) on white prints, of the plan which shall
fully comply with Articles VI and VII.
B. Upon receipt of the above, the Township Secretary shall forward
immediately one copy of the plan to the Board of Supervisors; the
Township Planning Commission; the Township Engineers or township
representative; and, if the proposed subdivision or land development is
to have direct access to a state or federal highway, the district office of
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) in
Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania.
C. Review by the Township Planning Commission.
(1) At its next regular meeting, provided that such application was
made at least 14 days prior to the meeting, or at a special meeting
called for that purpose after receipt of the plan, the Planning
Commission may review the plan to determine its conformance to
the provisions contained in these regulations.
(2) The Planning Commission shall notify the Township Board of
Supervisors, in writing, of any recommended action, changes or
modifications to the plan after such decision is made, provided that
the Planning Commission shall make such recommendations within
45 days after the beginning of the ninety-day review period
stipulated above. If review by the Township Planning Commission
results in an unfavorable recommendation because the
requirements of this chapter have not been met, notification to the
Township Board of Supervisors should specify the defects found in
the plan and describe the requirements which have not been met,
and should cite the provisions of this chapter from which such
defects or requirements originate.
D. Review by the Township Board of Supervisors. Upon receipt of the
recommendations of the Planning Commission or upon expiration of 45
days from the beginning of the ninety-day review period stipulated
above, whichever comes first, the plan shall be placed upon the agenda
of the Board of Supervisors for review at its next regularly scheduled
public meeting or, at the Board of Supervisors' discretion, at a special
public meeting to be held for that purpose.
(1) The Board of Supervisors shall review the plan and the written
reports thereon of the Township Planning Commission to determine
§ 215-13 RICHLAND CODE § 215-13
215:466
if the plan meets the provisions contained in these regulations.
Before acting on any plan, the Board of Supervisors may hold a
public hearing thereon after public notice. Prior to final review of
a plan for which off-site sewer or water service is proposed, the
Board of Supervisors shall require, as a condition of preliminary
approval, if water is to be provided by means other than private
wells owned and maintained by the individual owners of lots within
the subdivision or development, that the subdivision or
development is to be supplied by a certificated public utility, a
bona fide cooperative association of lot owners or by a municipal
corporation, authority or utility. A copy of the certificate of public
convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or
an application for such certificate, a cooperative agreement or a
commitment or agreement to serve the area in question, whichever
is appropriate, shall be acceptable evidence.
(2) The decision of the Township Board of Supervisors shall be in
writing and shall be communicated to the applicant personally or
mailed to him at his last known address not later than 15 days
following the decision.
(a) If the plan receives preliminary approval by the Township
Board of Supervisors, the action of the Board of Supervisors
shall be noted, together with the date of action and signature
of the Chairman and Secretary, on two copies of the plan. One
copy of the plan shall be given to the applicant, while the other
copy shall be retained in the township files. After the
signatures are obtained, the applicant may immediately begin
to lay out all lots, parcels, blocks, easements and rights-of-way
and construct all streets, sanitary sewage disposal systems,
water supply systems, storm drainage facilities and
monuments in accordance with the approved plan, but no
parcel or lot may be conveyed or recorded until after final
approval of the plat.
(b) If the plan is not approved, the decision shall specify the
defects found in the plan and describe the requirements which
have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the provisions of
this chapter from which such defects or requirements
originate.
(c) Within 30 days after the issuance of the decision, the applicant
may submit a corrected plan for review by the Township Board
of Supervisors. If submitted, the Board of Supervisors shall
consider the plan at a regularly scheduled meeting or at a
special meeting held within 45 days after resubmission. A plan
resubmitted under this action need not be sent to any planning
commission prior to consideration by the Board of Supervisors.
§ 215-13 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 215-13
215:467
§ 215-14. Final review of plan.
A plan shall be officially submitted to the Township Secretary for final
township review after all improvements indicated on the plan receiving
preliminary approval have been installed or, in lieu of the completion of the
improvements, after deposit with the township of a corporate bond or other
security acceptable to the Township Board of Supervisors in accordance
with Subsections D(1) and (2). All plans which have received preliminary
approval shall be entitled to final approval in accordance with the terms of
the approved preliminary application for a period of five years from the date
of the preliminary approval.
[1] If the plan as resubmitted corrects all the defects cited in
the denial, the Township Board of Supervisors shall
approve the corrected plan.
[2] If changes are made by the applicant which were not cited
as defects in the plan by the Township Board of
Supervisors in their decision disapproving the plan, such
plan may be considered as a new plan and must be
submitted for approval in accordance with § 215-13 of this
article.
(3) Failure of the Township Board of Supervisors to render a decision
and communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the
manner required herein shall be deemed an approval of the plan in
terms as presented unless the applicant has agreed, in writing, to
an extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation of communication of the decision, in which case,
failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of
presentation of communication shall have like effect.
A. All applications for final approval of a plan shall be acted upon by the
township within such time limits as established in this chapter, provided
that the Board of Supervisors shall render its decision and
communicate it to the applicant not later than 90 days after the date of
the next regular meeting of the Board of Supervisors following the date
the application is filed, provided that should said next regular meeting
occur more than 30 days following the filing of the application, said
ninety-day period shall be measured from the 13th day following the
day the application was filed. The plan shall conform to that which
received preliminary approval by the Township Board of Supervisors,
including all conditions and modifications attached hereto.
(1) In the case where subdivision and land development is projected
over a period of years, the Board of Supervisors may authorize final
review of the plan by sections or stages of development subject to
such requirements or guaranties as to improvements in future
sections or stages of development as it finds essential for the
protection of any finally approved section or stage of development.
In each such case, prior to preliminary approval of the plan, the
§ 215-13 RICHLAND CODE § 215-14
215:468
Board of Supervisors and the developer shall enter into a written
agreement specifying the sequence of development of sections
or stages, the maximum time permitted the developer for final
submission of the plan for each subsection, and any other
requirements or guaranties as are applicable to that particular
development. Where development is permitted in stages, all
improvements installed subsequent to the 50th anniversary of
preliminary approval of the plan shall conform to standards for
such improvements in effect at the time of installation of the same.
(2) Final official submission of the plan to the Township Board of
Supervisors shall consist of six copies of black (or blue) on white
prints of the plan, which shall fully comply with Article IX, § 215-43,
of these regulations and the conditions for which the plan received
preliminary approval, plus financial security specified in
Subsection D; all offers of dedication and deeds of easements to the
municipality; and all other required documents.
B. Review by the Township Board of Supervisors. Upon receipt of the
material listed in Subsection A(2), the Township Secretary shall forward
one copy of the plan to the Township Board of Supervisors; the
Township Planning Commission; the Township Engineers and/or
representatives; and, if the proposed subdivision or land development is
to have direct access to a state or federal highway, the district office of
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in Hollidaysburg,
Pennsylvania.
(1) The final review of the plan shall be conducted by the Township
Board of Supervisors in the same manner as prescribed for
preliminary review of the plan specified in § 215-13D, except that
final review shall be limited to determining if: the plan conforms to
the plan which received preliminary approval, including all
conditions and modifications required by the Township Board of
Supervisors; and the requirements for final plan review as listed
under Article IX, § 215-43, of this chapter have been met.
(2) As a condition of approval, the applicant shall permit the Township
Engineer and/or representative to make periodic site inspections of
such nature and extent as is necessary to ensure that the required
improvements are being installed and constructed in conformity
with the design standards contained herein or otherwise specified
in the preliminary approval of the plan. The township may charge a
review fee or fees according to a schedule adopted by the Board of
Supervisors by resolution. In no event shall the review fees exceed
the rate or cost charged by the engineer or consultant.
(3) If the applicant has completed all of the required improvements, he
shall notify the Township Board of Supervisors, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the completion of the improvements
and shall send a copy thereof to the Township Engineer and/or
representative. The Board of Supervisors hereby directs and
§ 215-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 215-14
215:469
authorizes the Township Engineer and/or representative to make
a final inspection of all the aforesaid improvements after receipt
of such notice. The Township Engineer and/or representative shall,
thereupon, file a written report with the Board of Supervisors
and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the applicant by
certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed
within 30 days after the receipt by the Township Engineer and/
or representative of the aforesaid authorization from the Board
of Supervisors. The report shall be detailed and shall indicate
approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in
part, and if the improvements or any portion thereof shall not be
approved or shall be rejected by the Township Engineer and/or
representative, the report shall contain a statement of the reasons
for such nonapproval or rejection. For subdivisions and land
developments served by off-site sewer and water service, the
Engineer and/or representative shall coordinate his review with
that of the appropriate authorities and/or companies providing
such service to ensure that the provisions of this chapter are met.
(a) The Board of Supervisors shall notify the applicant, in writing,
by certified or registered mail, of action taken with relation to
the improvements.
(b) If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer and/or
representative fail to comply with the time limitation
provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed
to have been approved and the applicant shall be released from
all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other
security agreement.
(c) If any portion of said improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the applicant
shall proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the
same procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be
followed.
C. No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plat
have been improved as may be required by this chapter and any curbs,
gutters, streetlights, fire hydrants, water mains, sanitary sewer, storm
drains and other improvements as are required by this chapter have
been installed in accordance with this chapter.
D. Financial security.
(1) In lieu of the completion of any improvements required as a
condition for the final approval of a plan, the applicant or
subdivider shall provide for deposit with the township financial
security in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of any
improvements or common amenities, including but not limited to
roads, stormwater detention and/or retention basins and other
related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space
§ 215-14 RICHLAND CODE § 215-14
215:470
improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate
financing, the Board of Supervisors shall furnish the developer with
a signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plat
contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial
security. The final plat or record plan shall not be signed nor
recorded until the financial improvements agreement is executed.
The resolution or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be
deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not
executed within 90 days unless a written extension is granted by
the Board of Supervisors; such extension shall not be unreasonably
withheld and shall be placed, in writing, at the request of the
developer. Without limitation as to other types of financial security
which the township may approve, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, the following shall be deemed acceptable
financial security for the purpose of this section:
(a) Federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts
in such lending institutions. Such financial security shall be
posted with a bonding company or federal or commonwealth
chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the
financial security, provided that said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business
within the commonwealth.
(b) Such bond or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be
required within one year of the date fixed in the subdivision
plan for the completion of such improvements.
(c) The amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the
cost of the required improvements for which financial security
is to be posted. The amount of financial security to be posted
for the completion of the required improvements shall be equal
to 110% of the cost of completion estimated as of 90 days
following the date scheduled for completion by the developer.
Annually, the Board of Supervisors may adjust the amount of
the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated
cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of
the expiration of the 90th day after either the original date
scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, the Board of Supervisors may
require the developer to post additional security in order to
assure that the financial security equals said 110%. Any
additional security shall be posted by the developer in
accordance with this subsection. The amount of financial
security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of
completion of the required improvements, submitted by an
§ 215-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 215-14
215:471
applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified
by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such
cost. The Board of Supervisors, upon the recommendation of
the Township Engineer and/or representative, may refuse to
accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant
or developer and the Board of Supervisors are unable to agree
upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and
recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such
in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Board of
Supervisors and the applicant or developer. The estimate
certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that
a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Board of Supervisors and
the applicant or developer.
(d) If the party posting the financial security requires more than
one year from the date of posting of the financial security to
complete the required improvements, the amount of financial
security may be increased by an additional 10% for each oneyear
period beyond the first anniversary date from posting of
financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the
cost of completing the required improvements as
reestablished, on or about the expiration of the preceding oneyear
period by using the above bidding procedure.
(2) In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plans by
section or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guaranties as to improvements in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally
approved section of the development.
(3) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release, or authorize the release of, from time to
time, such portions of the financial security necessary for payment
to the contractor or contractors performing the work.
(a) Such requests shall be in writing, addressed to the Board of
Supervisors, and the Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days
from receipt of such request within which to allow the
Township Engineer and/or representative to certify, in writing,
to the Board of Supervisors that such portion of the work upon
the improvements has been completed in accordance with the
authorized plan.
(b) Upon such certification, the Board of Supervisors shall
authorize release by the bonding company or lending
institution of an amount as estimated by the Township
§ 215-14 RICHLAND CODE § 215-14
215:472
§ 215-15. Release from improvement bond.
Engineer and/or representative fairly representing the value of
the improvements completed, or if the Board of Supervisors
fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the Board of
Supervisors shall be deemed to have approved the release of
funds, as requested. The Board of Supervisors may, prior to
final release at the time of completion and certification by its
Engineer and/or representative, require retention of 10% of
the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
(4) Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some of
the required improvements following completion, the Board of
Supervisors may require the posting of financial security to secure
structural integrity of said improvements, as well as the
functioning of said improvements in accordance with the design
and specifications as depicted on the final plan for a term not to
exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication.
(a) Said financial securities shall be of the same type as otherwise
required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall
not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
(b) If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under
the jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a
public utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from
the township, financial security to assure proper completion
and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with
the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal
authority and shall not be included within the financial security
as otherwise required by this section.
A. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of Supervisors, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township
Engineer and/or representative. The Board of Supervisors shall, within
10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Township
Engineer and/or representative to inspect all of the aforesaid
improvements. The Township Engineer and/or representative shall,
thereupon, file a report, in writing, with the Board of Supervisors, and
shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or
registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days
after receipt by the Township Engineer and/or representative of the
aforesaid authorization from the Board of Supervisors; said report shall
be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of
aid,improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements
or any portion thereof shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the
§ 215-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 215-15
215:473
Township Engineer and/or representative, said report shall contain a
statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
B. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the Engineer's and/or representative's report, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the action of said Board of Supervisors
with relation thereto.
C. If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer and/or
representative fails to comply with the time limitation provisions
contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to have been
approved and the developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant
to its performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
D. If any portion of said improvements shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall proceed to
complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
E. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the

Exceptions to Standard Procedures
§ 215-44. Requests for modification; conditions.
A. Whereas, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this
chapter would result in undue hardship, the Board shall make
reasonable exceptions to the regulations as will not be contrary to the
public interest. The request for modification shall be in writing and
shall accompany and be a part of the application for development. The
request shall state in full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or
hardship on which the request is based, the provision or provisions of
this chapter involved and the minimum modifications necessary. The
following shall serve as a general guide in determining the issuance of
an exception:
(1) That there exist special physical circumstances or conditions which
render the strict application of the requirements as undue or
unnecessary hardship;
(2) That the hardship created cannot be ameliorated by a reasonable
change in plans;
(3) That the unnecessary or undue hardship has not been created by
the applicant;
(4) That the waiver or varying of the strict terms of this chapter will
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this
chapter;
(5) That the property cannot be reasonably developed without the
waiver or the varying of the strict terms of this chapter; and
(6) That the waiver or varying of the strict terms of this chapter will
represent the minimum deviation that will afford relief and will
represent the least modification possible of the regulations in issue.
B. In granting such exceptions or modifications, the Township
Supervisors, upon the advice of the Planning Commission, may require
such conditions as will substantially secure the objectives of the
standards or requirements so varied or modified. Financial
disadvantage to the property owners is not in and of itself adequate
proof of hardship within the intent of these regulations.

ARTICLE XI
Remedies and Enforcement
§ 215-45. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final
plat, the Board of Supervisors is hereby granted the power to enforce
any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to
pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Board of Supervisors may, at its
option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action
to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by
such.security, and not for any other municipal purpose.
§ 215-46. Preventive remedies.
A. In addition to other remedies, the township may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The
description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer, or other
document used in the process of selling or transferring, shall not
exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the
remedies herein provided.
B. The township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has
been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real
property in violation of this chapter. This authority to deny such a
permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
(1) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(2) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation, without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(3) The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation, without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(4) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as
to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.

215:499
§ 215-47. Violations and penalties.159
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil
enforcement proceeding commenced by the township, pay a judgment of
not more than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees,
incurred by the township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence
or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the District Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the township may enforce the judgment pursuant to
the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues
shall constitute a separate violation, unless the District Justice determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good
faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this chapter
to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall
be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following
the date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order
of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.160
C. As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an
approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the township may require
compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to the
property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real
property.

For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment with the Township of
Richland during the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such

the provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the following
purposes as the same may be allocated by the Township of Richland from
time to time: emergency services, which shall include emergency medical
services, police services and/or fire services; road construction and/or
maintenance; reduction of property taxes; or property tax relief through
implementation of a homestead and farmstead exclusion in accordance with
53 Pa.C.S.A., Chapter 95, Subchapter F (relating to homestead property
exclusion). The political subdivision shall use no less than 25% of the funds
derived from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in addition to
all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the political
subdivision. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person maybe employed.
§ 220-27. Exemption and refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.

armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
§ 220-26 RICHLAND CODE § 220-27
215:514
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for
a given calendar year, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating

exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Township of Richland, in consultation with the collector
and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general
municipal law relating to refunds or overpayments and interest on
overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75
days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject
to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. Richland Township or the collector
shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt
persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro-rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods,
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the
tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
§ 220-27 RICHLAND CODE § 220-28
215:516
§ 220-29. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 220-30. Manner of determining tax liability and payment;
deadline.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the collector on or before the 30th day following the end of
each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 220-31. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the collector on or
before the thirtieth day following the end of each year.
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person maybe employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 220-27 of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

215:517
§ 220-32. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 220-33. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 220-34. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claims to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which the person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him for each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the

Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.

aggrieved by any decision of the collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of
1998.163
C. The collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision

P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or

purposes.

Water Shortage Response Plan
[Adopted 2-27-1989 by Ord. No. 192]
§ 234-9. Adoption of plan.
The Water Shortage Response Plan of the Highland Sewer and Water
Authority, attached hereto,188 is adopted herein by reference. This plan may
be modified and updated by said Highland Sewer and Water Authority.
§ 234-10. Nonessential water uses.
Those uses of water not essential to the protection of public health and
safety are deemed nonessential. Nonessential uses of water may be
restricted by both voluntary and mandatory measures as prescribed and
outlined within the Water Shortage Response Plan. A list of nonessential
water uses is included in the plan.
§ 234-11. Mandatory restriction; surcharge for noncompliant
users.189
If, during a water shortage period, a voluntary ban on nonessential uses
of water has not sufficiently reduced the rate of depletion of water supply
sources, and those sources have reached a level at which the response
plan prescribed more severe demand reduction measures, a mandatory
restriction of nonessential water uses shall be imposed. Those water service
customers found not cooperating with this action shall face a surcharge as
set from time to time by resolution of the Board of Supervisors for each day
of noncompliance, or the curtailment of water service, whichever is deemed
most appropriate.
§ 234-12. Water rationing.
If a water shortage emergency is declared by the Governor of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania within an area which includes the service
area of the Township of Richland and both voluntary and mandatory
restrictions of nonessential water uses have failed to sufficiently reduce the
rate of depletion of all available water supply sources, and if the Highland
Sewer and Water Authority Plan for water rationing has been reviewed
and approved by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Council, water
rationing may be implemented. The Highland Sewer and Water Authority's
Water Rationing Plan is included in the Water Shortage Response Plan.
§ 234-13. Request for variance from restrictions.
Whereas, owing to special circumstances, a literal enforcement of the
restrictions imposed by the Local Water Rationing Plan would impose an

234:567
"extraordinary hardship," as defined in said plan, on a residential or
nonresidential customer, said customer may apply for a variance from said
restrictions according to the procedures and standards set forth below.
§ 234-14. Filing of variance; required information.
A request for a variance from said restrictions imposed herein shall be
filed at the office of the Highland Sewer and Water Authority and state the
following information:
§ 234-15. Hearing on variance; notice.
Upon receipt of a request for a variance from the restrictions imposed
herein, a hearing shall be scheduled before the Highland Sewer and Water
Authority Board. Public notice of said hearing setting forth the name,
address and nature of the request for a variance and the time and place
of said hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation in the
township not less than three or more than 10 days prior to said hearing.
Further, notice of said hearing shall be posted on the Authority's office and
written notice shall be given to the Richland Township Board of Supervisors.
§ 234-16. Variance guidelines; conditions.
A. Name of the customer.
B. Address of the customer.
C. Type of usage, i.e., residential, nonresidential.
D. If nonresidential, the nature of business, including hours of operation.
E. Details of the nature of the extraordinary hardship imposed upon the
customer.
F. Amount of variance requested from the restrictions.
A. The following shall serve as general guidelines in determining the
issuance of a variance:
(1) That there exist special circumstances which render the strict
application of the restrictions an extraordinary hardship.
(2) That the extraordinary hardship has not been created by the
customer's actions but by the imposition of the restrictions
generally.
(3) That the varying of the restrictions for the customer will not have
the effect of the nullifying the intent and purpose of the water
restrictions or undermine the public's perception of equitable
sharing of the hardships caused by the restrictions.
§ 234-13 RICHLAND CODE § 234-16
234:568
(4) That the varying of the strict terms of the restrictions will represent
the minimum variation that will afford relief and will represent the
least modification possible of the regulations in issue.
(5) That it will not affect the public health, safety and welfare.
B. In granting such variations, the Highland Sewer and Water Authority
Board of Directors may require such conditions as will substantially
secure the objectives of the restrictions so varied.

conforming purpose may continue and may be altered or enlarged
unless the alteration or enlargement would increase the nonconformity
of the structure with respect to the setback requirements (by reason of
the physical encroachments of such proposed alteration or enlargement
upon the setback areas), the land coverage requirements or the density
requirement of the district in which the structure is located at the time

§ 240-99. Creation, appointment and organization
A. Creation and membership. There is hereby established a Zoning
Hearing Board. The membership of the Board shall consist of five
residents of the township appointed by the Board of Supervisors. The
members of the Board shall be appointed for a five-year term, however,
the terms of the first Board members appointed shall be for a term of
one, two, three, four and five years so that each year a Board member's
term expires. The Board shall promptly notify the Board of Supervisors
of any vacancies which occur. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be
only for the unexpired portion of the term. The Board of Supervisors
may appoint one, two or three residents of the township to serve as
alternate members of the Zoning Hearing Board. If, by reason of
absence or disqualification of a member, a quorum is not reached, the
Chairman of the Board shall designate as many alternate members of
the Board to sit on the Board as may be needed to provide a quorum.
Any alternate member of the Board shall continue to serve on the Board
in all proceedings involving the matter or case for which the alternate
was initially appointed until the Board has made a final determination
of the matter or case. Designation of an alternate pursuant to this
section shall be made on a case by case basis and rotation according to
the declining seniority among all alternates. Members of the Board and
alternates shall hold no other office in the township.
B. Removal of members. Any Board member may be removed for
malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance in the office or for other just
cause by a majority vote of the Board of Supervisors taken after the
member has received 15 days' advance notice of the intent to take such
a vote. A hearing shall be held in connection with the vote if the
member shall request it in writing.
C. Organization. The Board shall elect from its own membership its
officers, who shall serve annual terms as such and may succeed
themselves. For the conduct of any hearing and the taking of any action,
a quorum shall be not less than a majority of all the members of the
Board, but the Board may appoint a hearing officer from its own
membership to conduct any hearing on its behalf and the parties may
waive further action by the Board. The Board may make, alter and
rescind rules and forms for its procedure consistent with ordinances of
the township and laws of the commonwealth. The Board shall keep full
public records of its business and shall submit a report of its activities
to the Board of Supervisors once a year.
D. Expenses. Within the limits of funds appropriated by the township, the
Board may employ or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel,
consultants and other technical and clerical services. Members of the
Board may receive compensation for the performance of their duties as
may be fixed by the township.

addition, require that the site plan shows an intent to comply with
the conditions, if any, imposed by the Zoning Hearing Board.
B. The standards for review of proposed variance, special exception or

240-67A(14), 240-74B(28), 240-80A(32) and 240-87A(20), the
Zoning Hearing Board should determine that the following
guidelines are met before granting the request:
(a) The size, scope, extent and character of the special exception,
variance or use requested is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan of the township and promotes the
harmonious and orderly development of the zoning district
involved.
(b) The proposed change or modification constitutes an
appropriate use consistent with the character and type of
development in the area surrounding the location for which the
request is made and will not substantially impair, alter or
detract from the use of surrounding property or the character
of the neighborhood in light of the zoning classification of the
area affected; the effect on other properties in the area; the
number, extent and scope of nonconforming uses in the area;
and the presence or the absence in the neighborhood of
conditions or uses which are the same or similar in character
to the condition of use for which applicant seeks approval.
(c) The proposed use is suitable with respect to traffic and
highways in the area and provides for adequate access and offstreet
parking arrangements in order to protect major streets
and highways from undue congestion and hazard.
§ 240-100 WATER § 240-100
234:647
(d) Major street and highway frontage will be developed so as to
limit the total number of access points and encourage the
frontage of buildings on parallel marginal roads or on roads
perpendicular to the major street or highway.
(e) The proposed change is reasonable in terms of the logical,
efficient and economical extension of public services and
facilities, such as public water, sewers, police, fire protection
and public schools, and assure adequate arrangements for
sanitation in specific instances.
(f) All commercial or industrial parking, loading, access or service
areas will be adequately illuminated at night while in use and
arranged so as to comply the requirements of Article XVIII
dealing with special regulations and relating to access and
highway frontage.
(g) Conditions are being imposed on the grant of the request
necessary to ensure that the general purpose and intent of this
zoning chapter is complied with and that the use of the
property adjacent to the area included in the proposed change
or modification is adequately safeguarded with respect to
harmonious design of buildings, aesthetics, planting and its
maintenance as a sight or sound screen, landscaping, hours of
operation, lighting, numbers of persons involved, allied
activities, ventilation, noise, sanitation, safety, smoke and fume
control and the minimizing of noxious, offensive or hazardous
elements.
(h) The proposed change protects and promotes the safety, health,
morals and general welfare of the township.
(i) For further provisions relating to special exceptions, see
Article XVII hereof.
(2) In addition, to approve a proposed variance the Board must also
find, where relevant to given causes:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the

LUMINANCE METER  Luminance, measured in candelas/
square meter (cd/m2), represents the quantity of light leaving
a surface in a particular direction relative to the size of the
area of the surface from which it is leaving. As such, it is
related to the perceived brightness of the surface. A luminance
meter is an instrument for measuring this quantity by aiming it
along the line of sight to the surface. Note that the size of the
surface measured is a function of the measurement distance
due to the fixed size of the measurement area within the meter.
Also note that this unit of measure is sometimes called the
"nit." However, this is a term that is deprecated (ANSI/IES
RP-16-10). Measures in cd/m2 and nits are equivalent.
C. The total area on one side of all signs attached to a building and facing

Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be erected,
altered or maintained and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone
created by this article to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for such zone. The height limitations for each of the
zones are as follows:
A. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The height limitation
slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and
at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway center
line; then the limitation slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each foot
vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the
extended runway center line.
B. Runway Larger Than Utility With a Visibility Minimum Greater Than
Three-Fourths Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. The
height limitation slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended
runway center line.
C. Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet
along the extended runway center line.
D. Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum As Low As
Three-Fourths Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes 34
feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway center line.
E. Transitional Zones. The height limitation slopes seven feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as
the primary surface and the approach surface and extending to a height
of 150 feet above the airport elevation. In addition to the foregoing,
there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface and extending to where they intersect the conical
surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach projects
beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping
seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and
at the same elevation as the approach surface and extending a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90º angles to the
extended runway center line.
§ 240-119 RICHLAND CODE § 240-120
234:708
§ 240-121. Use restrictions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be made
of land or water within any zone established by this article in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or
radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in
the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the
airport, create hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
§ 240-122. Nonconforming uses.
§ 240-123. Zoning approval related to airport zones.
F. Horizontal Zone. The height limitation is established at 150 feet above

upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and to 150
feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet
above the airport elevation.
H. Accepted height limitations. Nothing in this article shall be construed
as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure or
growth of any tree to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the
land.
A. Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article
should not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date of this article or otherwise interfere
with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein
shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use
of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun
prior to the effective date of this article and is diligently prosecuted.
B. Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance
thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the
Township Supervisors to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the
vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such
markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the
expense of Johnstown Cambria County Airport Authority or any
successor organization or corporation.
A. Future uses.
(1) Except as specifically provided in Subsection A(1)(a), (b) and (c)
hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no

234:709
structure shall be erected or otherwise established and no trees
shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless zoning approval
therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application
for zoning approval shall meet the requirements of this article
in addition to the requirements set forth in Article XV and shall
indicate the purpose for which the zoning approval is desired, with
sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the
resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the
zoning approval shall be granted. No zoning approval for use
inconsistent with the provisions of this Article XX shall be granted
unless a variance has been approved by the Zoning Hearing Board.
(a) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when,
because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such
tree would extend above the height limits prescribed for such
zones.
(b) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of
the runway, no zoning approval shall be required for any tree
less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except
when such tree would extend above the height limit prescribed
for such approach zones.
(c) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be
required for any tree less than 75 feet of vertical height above
the ground except when such tree, because of terrain, land
contour or topographic features, would extend above the
height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
(2) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or
alteration of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any
height limits established by this article.
B. Existing uses. No zoning approval shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming
use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than
it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto or
than it is when the application for a zoning approval is made. Except as
indicated, all applications for such zoning approval shall be granted.
C. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed by this article may apply to
the Zoning Hearing Board for a variance from such regulations. Such
variances shall be heard in accordance with the standards and
§ 240-123 RICHLAND CODE § 240-123
234:710
§ 240-124. Enforcement.
It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to administer and enforce the
regulations prescribed herein. Application for permits and variances shall
be made to the Zoning Officer in accordance with Article XV of this chapter.
§ 240-125. Violations and penalties.
Each violation of this article shall be punishable as set forth in Article XV of
this chapter.
§ 240-126. Conflicting regulations.
Where any of the regulations or limitation prescribed in this article are
inconsistent or conflict with any other zoning regulations applicable to the
same area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures
or trees, the use of land or any other matter, the more stringent limitation
or requirement shall govern and prevail.
procedures set forth in Article XVI of this chapter and may be allowed
where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of
the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and that the relief
granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create
a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice and will be in
accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, an application
for variance from the requirements of this article may be referred by
the Zoning Hearing Board to the Johnstown Cambria County Airport
Authority or the Johnstown Cambria County Airport Manager for advice
as to the aeronautical affects of the variance.
D. Obstruction, marking and lighting. When such action is deemed
advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and to be reasonable
in the circumstances, a granted zoning approval or variance may be
conditioned to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to
install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings
and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Zoning
Hearing Board, this condition may be modified to require the owner to
permit the Johnstown Cambria County Airport Authority, at its own
expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and
lights.
