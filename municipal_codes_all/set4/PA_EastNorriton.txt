MUNICIPAL CLAIMS AND TAX LIENS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Tax collection  See Ch. 46.
§ 19-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a schedule of reasonable attorneys'
fees for performance of certain activities necessary to collect municipal
claims and liens on behalf of the Township. These attorneys' fees shall
be collectible by the Township in the event that they are incurred in the
collection of any claim or lien resulting from the failure of any property
owner to pay amounts required by law for taxes, municipal improvements,
removal of nuisances, water rents or rates, sewer rates and lighting rates
and any other assessable or lienable Township services. In addition to these
fees, any and all costs incurred by the Township with respect to collection
and enforcement of a municipal claim or lien shall be due in addition to the
underlying claim or lien.
§ 19-2. Schedule of attorneys' fees. [Amended 9-8-1998 by Ord. No.
394]
Attorneys' fees imposed in proceedings to recover any delinquent municipal
claim or enforce any municipal lien will be equal to the time expended in
the collection matter multiplied by the then current hourly rate that the
Solicitor charges the Township on other matters. The Township approves
this schedule and finds it to be fair and reasonable for the services to
be rendered and shall impose these fees upon the property owner in
proceedings to recover delinquent municipal claims and liens, together with
all costs, penalties, expenses and interest incurred.
§ 19-3. Applicability of other laws and interest. [Amended
7-26-2011 by Ord. No. 539]
The fees set forth herein for attorneys fees related to collection of Township
claims and liens shall be in addition to and not in limitation of sums
permitted to be collected under any other laws and shall be in addition to
interest, where permitted. Interest will be charged at a rate of 10% per
annum on all liens filed by East Norriton Township except in the event of a
lien filed to recover a property owners assessment associated with a public
project for which the Township has obtained financing. In such event, the
lesser of 12% per annum or the financing rate will be applied.

however, that if the loss as agreed upon by the named insured and the
insuring agent equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability
on all fire policies covering the building or other structure, the following
procedures must be followed:
A. The insuring agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
designated officer of the municipality in the aggregate of $2,000 for
each $15,000 of a claim and for each fraction of that amount of a claim,
this subsection to be applied such that if the claim is $15,000 or less,
the amount transferred to the municipality shall be $2,000; or
B. If at the time of a loss report, the named insured has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or other structure in an amount less than the
amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the insuring
agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified
in the estimate.
C. The transfer of proceeds shall be on pro rata basis by all companies,
associations or exchanges insuring the building or other structure.

estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure, and the designated officer shall return the amount of
the funds transferred to the municipality in excess of the estimate to the
named insured if the municipality has not commenced to remove, repair
or secure the building or other structure.
E. Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the municipality shall do
the following:
(1) The designated officer shall place the proceeds in the separate fund
to be used solely as security against the total costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or structure which are incurred
by the municipality. Such costs shall include, without limitation,
any engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the
municipality in connection with such removal, repair or securing of
the building or any proceedings related thereto.

regulations and orders of the municipality and the required proof of
such completion received by the designated officer, and if the
municipality has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or
securing, the fund shall be returned to the named insured. If the
municipality has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of
the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the
fund, and, if excess funds remain, the municipality shall transfer
the remaining finds to the named insured.
(4) To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the
municipality pursuant to this section and not returned to the named
insured, such interest shall belong to the municipality. To the extent
that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest earned
on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the

ARTICLE I
Regulations and Restrictions
[Adopted 8-22-1994 by Ord. No. 342]
§ 127-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "East Norriton Township Noise
Ordinance."
§ 127-2. Statutory authority.
This article is enacted pursuant to Section 702 of the Second Class
Township Code, clauses XII, XXIX, XXXV, XLI, LXII, 53 P.S. §§ 65712, 65729,
65735, 65741 and 65762.
§ 127-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to ensure that public health, safety and welfare
shall not be abridged by the making and creating of noise pollution or
of public nuisances from disturbing, excessive or offensive noises in the
Township. The residents of the Township recognize that uncontrolled noise
represents a danger to the health and welfare of their neighbors and that
each person in the community is entitled to live in an environment in which
the level of impulsive and amplified noise is minimized for the community
good. It is the purpose and scope of this article to provide regulations
defining the maximum sound levels that vehicles, appliances and equipment
shall be allowed to produce at specified distances from these devices and
also to provide for the prohibition of other kinds of offensive noises. These
regulations and prohibitions are intended to protect the physical, mental
and social well-being of the residents of the Township.
§ 127-4. Legislative findings.
The Board of Supervisors finds that the failure of individuals, businesses,
industries, persons maintaining animals, social gatherings and other
activities to regulate the noise emanating from their premises constitutes a
violation of the peace and enjoyment of the residents of the Township and a
public nuisance. Specifically, such noise emanating from home occupations,
businesses, industries, sound amplification equipment, radios, electronic
sound recording equipment, vehicles, persons maintaining animals, social
gatherings and other activities:
A. Creates a nuisance in that residents are deprived of the enjoyment of
their homes, disturbed in their sleep or otherwise prevented from the
quiet enjoyment of their residential premises;
B. Affects the property values of residences in the residential district of
the Township;
C. Affects the public welfare by reflecting negatively on the residential
districts established for the Township;
§ 127-1 KEROSENE HEATING AND STORAGE § 127-4

usage.
B. The following words and phrases, when used in this article, shall have,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the meanings given to
them in this section.
ANSI  American National Standards Institute or its successors.
DECIBEL (dB)  A unit of sound level which is a division of a
logarithmic scale used to express the ratio of the sound pressure of
the source to the pressure of an arbitrarily chosen reference pressure;
the ratio is expressed on the decibel scale by multiplying its base 10
logarithm by 20.
EXCESSIVE NOISE  That sound which is:
FLUCTUATING NOISE  A noise whose sound level varies significantly
with time.
IMPULSIVE NOISE  Characterized by brief excursions of sound level.
The duration of a single impulse is usually less than one second.
INTERMITTENT NOISE  A noise whose sound level exceeds the
ambient noise levels at least twice during the period of observation,
which is one minute or more. The period of time during which the level
of the noise remains at an essentially constant value different from that
of the ambient is on the order of one second or more.
NIGHTTIME  9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., prevailing time.
NOISE  Any sound emitted by a person, animal, appliance,
equipment, instrument or other device.
NOISE LEVEL  Airborne sound levels expressed in dB and obtained
by the use of specific frequency dependent weighting networks, as
specified in the referenced standards and indicated by proper notation;
if "A" weighting is employed, the sound level is identified as dB(A).
NOISE POLLUTION  Noise of such loudness and character from a
single source or from multiple sources, which is or may be predicted
Injurious or which unreasonably interferes with the comfortable
enjoyment of life and property. Measured noise levels in excess of
limits established in these regulations or those specified in valid
permits are declared to be "excessive noise."

lawful business or activity. Noise/sound pressure levels exceeding those
permitted in any district shall constitute "noise pollution."
PARTY  A social gathering.
PERIOD OF OBSERVATION  The time interval during which
acoustical data are obtained. The period of observation is determined
by the characteristics of the noise being measured and the
instrumentation being used. The period of observation must be at least
as long as the response time of the instrumentation. The greater the
variance in individual sound level, the longer must be the observation
time for a given expected accuracy of measurement.
PERSON  Includes an individual, firm, association, organization,
partnership, trust, company, corporation or any other similar entity.
SAE, INCORPORATED  Society of Automotive Engineers.
SOUND LEVEL  Noise level.
SOUND-LEVEL METER  An instrument or combination of
instruments which meets or exceeds the requirements for an ANSI Type
S1A or Type S2A sound-level meter.
STEADY NOISE  A noise whose level remains essentially constant
(i.e., fluctuations are less than five dB) during the period of observation.
VEHICLE  Any device or combination of devices used for or capable
of being used for transporting persons or property. "Vehicles" include
but are not limited to the following: automobiles, trucks, buses,
motorcycles, motorized bicycles, snowmobiles, scooters, all-terrain

A. General standards. No person shall create or allow the creation of any
noise or operate or cause to be operated any source of sound on
property in any zoning district owned, leased, occupied or otherwise
controlled by such person, which causes the sound level, when
measured at or beyond the boundaries of the lot on which such
activities take place, to exceed the noise levels specified below in the
various zoning districts unless otherwise specifically set forth herein.
Noise levels shall be measured at the setback lines of the properties
adjacent to the property from which the noise is emanating.

§ 127-14. Findings.
The Board of Supervisors of the Township of East Norriton, Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania, finds as a fact that the operation of an engine brake
on a gasoline-powered or diesel-powered motor vehicle not equipped with
exhaust mufflers, or equipped with defective or modified exhaust mufflers
(commonly referred to as engine brake retarders), so as to create excessive
noise through the use of said engine brake, adversely affects the public
health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Township of East Norriton
and, therefore, is a nuisance in fact.
§ 127-15. Operation on certain roads prohibited.
No gasoline-powered or diesel-powered motor vehicle shall be operated on
the following streets, roads, alleys or highways within the Township of East
Norriton, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, utilizing, in said operation,
an engine brake, without exhaust mufflers, or with defective or modified
exhaust mufflers (commonly referred to as engine brake retarders),
permitting excessive noise to be created by said motor vehicle:

This article shall not apply to emergency driving situations requiring the
utilization of an engine brake to protect the safety and property of the
residents of East Norriton Township, other motor vehicle operators,
pedestrians, and the operator and passengers of the motor vehicle involved
in said emergency situation.
§ 127-18. Violations and penalties.
A. Any person, firm, corporation or organization violating any of the
provisions of this article shall, upon summary conviction before a
District Magistrate having jurisdiction, be guilty of violating § 3111 of
the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3111, and shall be
deemed a nuisance under this article and shall be punishable by a
minimum fine or not less than $100 and a maximum fine of not more
than $1,000, plus costs of prosecution and, in default of the payment
thereof, shall be sentenced to undergo imprisonment in the Township of
East Norriton for a period not to exceed 10 days or imprisonment in the

names of all persons 18 years of age and older residing in said
residential rental unit. Said list shall be submitted within 60 days of the
effective date of this chapter, and shall be updated each year upon

licenses shall comply with the general laws of East Norriton Township,
and the International Property Maintenance Code, as amended.
§ 159-5 EAST NORRITON CODE § 159-7
158:212
§ 160-1. Purpose.
§ 160-2. Responsible contractor requirements.
A. The Township of East Norriton (hereinafter "Township") recognizes that
there is a need to ensure that all work on public construction and
maintenance contracts is performed by responsible, qualified firms that
maintain the capacity, expertise, personnel and other qualifications and
resources necessary to successfully perform public contracts in a
timely, reliable and cost-effective manner.
B. To effectuate the purpose of selecting responsible contractors for public
contracts and to protect Township investments in such contracts,
prospective contractors and subcontractors should be required to meet
preestablished, clearly defined, minimum standards relating to
contractor responsibility, including requirements and criteria
concerning technical qualifications, competency, experience, adequacy
of resources, including equipment, financial and personnel, and
satisfactory records regarding past project performance, safety, law
compliance and business integrity.
C. Further, due to the critical impact that skilled construction craft labor
has on public works projects, and due to the limited availability of
skilled construction craft labor and imminent craft labor skill shortages,
it is necessary to require contractors and subcontractors to participate
in established, formal apprenticeship training programs as a condition
of bidding, for the purpose of both promoting successful project
delivery and ensuring future workforce development. The Township
also recognizes that it is beneficial to the local community to ensure
that firms receiving public contracts provide adequate wages and
benefits to their employees and utilize fair business, employment and
training practices that have a positive impact on local communities
affected by such contracts.
D. Therefore, Township shall require compliance with the provisions of
this chapter by business entities seeking to provide services to the
Township as specified herein. The requirements of this chapter are
intended to supplement, not replace, existing contractor qualification
and performance standards or criteria currently required by law, public
policy or contracting documents. However, in the event that any of the
provisions of this chapter conflict with any law, public policy or
contracting documents of the Township, this chapter shall prevail.
A. All contractors and subcontractors of any tier that perform work valued
at over $100,000 on any public facility or public works project,
including construction, alteration, renovation, repair, service
(excluding trash hauling) or maintenance work, shall meet the
requirements of this chapter. [Amended 11-18-2014 by Ord. No.

§ 160-3. Contractor responsibility certifications.
B. All firms engaged in contracts covered by this chapter shall be
qualified, responsible contractors or subcontractors that have sufficient
capabilities in all respects to successfully perform contracts on which
they are engaged, including the necessary experience, equipment,
technical skills and qualifications and organizational, financial and
personnel resources. Firms bidding on public contracts shall also be
required to have a satisfactory past performance record and a
satisfactory record of law compliance, integrity and business ethics.
C. If, after three attempts by the Township to award a contract to a
responsible bidder, as defined in this chapter, no bidder is determined
to meet the requirements of this chapter, this chapter shall not apply to
subsequent attempts to bid the project.
A. As a condition of performing work on a public works contract subject to
this chapter, a general contractor, construction manager or other lead
or prime contractor seeking award of a contract shall submit a
contractor responsibility certification at the time it submits its bid for a
contract.
B. The contractor responsibility certification shall be completed on a form
provided by Township and shall reference the project for which a bid is
being submitted by name and contract or project number.

is an apprenticeship program that is currently registered with

journey person status for at least three of the past five years.
(b) If a firm is identified as the lowest responsible bidder or
otherwise selected as the prospective awardee or as a
subcontractor of an awardee, it shall provide appropriate

meets the requirements of this chapter for each trade or
classification of craft workers it will employ on the project. This

certification and shall include an attestation stating, under the
penalty of perjury, that the information submitted is true, complete

D. Execution of the contractor responsibility certification required by this
chapter shall not establish a presumption of contractor responsibility,
and the Township may require any additional information it deems
necessary to evaluate a firm's status as a responsible contractor,
including technical qualifications, financial capacity or other resources
and performance capabilities. The Township may require that such
information be included in a separate statement of qualifications and
experience or as an attachment to the contractor responsibility
certification.

business entity, whether as a parent company, subsidiary or in any other
business relation, it shall attach a separate statement to its contractor
responsibility certification that explains in detail the nature of any such
relationship. Additional information may be required from such an
entity if the relationship in question could potentially impact contract
performance.

of intent to award contract to the firm offering the lowest responsive
bid.
B. Such notice shall be issued immediately or as soon as practicable after

contractor in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and
other applicable laws and regulations and has the resources and
capabilities to successfully perform the contract.
B. As part of this review process, the Township shall ensure that the
contractor responsibility certification, the subcontractor list and the
subcontractor responsibility certifications, as required by this chapter,
have been submitted and properly executed.
C. The township may conduct any additional inquiries to verify that the
prospective awardee and its subcontractors have the technical
qualifications and performance capabilities necessary to successfully
perform the contract and that the firms have a sufficient record of law
compliance and business integrity to justify the award of a public
contract. In conducting such inquiries, the Township may seek relevant
information from the firm, its prior clients or customers, its
subcontractors or any other relevant source.
D. If, at the conclusion of its internal review, the Township determines that
all responsibility certifications have been properly competed and
executed and if it concludes that the qualifications, background and
responsibility of the prospective awardee and the firms on its

§ 160-8. Public review process.
subcontractor list are satisfactory, it shall issue a written contractor
responsibility determination verifying that the prospective awardee is
a qualified, responsible contractor. In the event a firm is determined
to be nonresponsible, the Township shall advise the firm of its finding
in writing and proceed to conduct a responsibility review of the nextlowest
responsive bidder or, if necessary, rebid the project. Prior to the
awarding of a contract, the Township must follow the procedures as set
forth in Section 3102 of the Second Class Township Code.77

on its subcontractor list and provided a subcontractor responsibility
certification in accordance with the requirements of § 160-5 of this
chapter.
B. A subcontractor listed on a firm's subcontractor list shall not be
substituted unless written authorization is obtained from the Township
and a subcontractor responsibility certification is provided for the
substitute subcontractor.
C. In the event that the Township determines that a prospective
subcontractor listed by the apparent low bidder does not meet the
responsibility standards of this chapter, it may, after informing the
prospective awardee, exercise one of the following options:
(1) Permit the awardee to substitute a qualified, responsible
subcontractor in accordance with the requirements of this chapter;
(2) Require the awardee to self-perform the work in question if the firm
has the required experience, licenses and other qualifications to
perform the work in question; or

general contractor, construction manager or other lead or prime
contractor shall not be permitted to make any type of contractual claim
against the Township on the basis of a subcontractor disqualification.

§ 160-6 EAST NORRITON CODE § 160-8
158:218
§ 160-9. Emergencies.
Should the Board of Supervisors determine, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3102(h)(1) of the Second Class Township Code, that
emergency circumstances exist that render the requirements and
procedures set forth in this chapter unduly burdensome, then in that event
the Township may award a procurement contract without application of the
terms of this chapter.
A. The contractor responsibility certification for a firm identified in a
notice of intent to award contract, subcontractor lists and
subcontractor responsibility certifications shall be made immediately
available to the public for inspection through a publicly accessible
website or other comparable means.
B. During the public review period, any person or organization may
protest a contractor or subcontractor for failing to meet applicable
requirements of this chapter or on any other relevant grounds by
submitting a letter with supporting evidence to the Township.
C. If the Township determines that a contractor or subcontractor
responsibility certification contains false or misleading material
information that was provided knowingly or with reckless disregard for
the truth or omits material information knowingly or with reckless
disregard of the truth, the firm for which the certification was
submitted shall be prohibited from performing work for the Township
for a period of three years and shall be subject to any other penalties
and sanctions, including contract termination, available to the
Township under law. A contract terminated under these circumstances
shall further entitle the Township to withhold payment of any monies
due to the firm as damages.
D. A procurement contract subject to this chapter shall not be executed
until all requirements of this chapter have been fulfilled and until
contractor and subcontractor responsibility certifications and
subcontractor lists have been made available for public inspection for
at least 10 days following submission of such information.

§ 162-24. Measuring volume of sanitary sewage.
A. Methods of measuring volume.
(1) Whenever a person purchasing all water used from the water
supplier discharges sanitary sewage into the sewer system, the
volume of water consumed, as determined from meter readings of
the water supplier, shall be used in computing the sewer rental.
(2) In cases where dwellings and establishments have sources of water
supply in addition to or other than that of the water supplier, those
dwellings and establishments shall provide a meter on such
additional or other source of supply. The total amount of water
consumed, as shown by these meter readings, will be used in
computing the sewer rental.
(3) In cases where establishments use water from the water supplier
and/or from an independent supply for industrial or recreational
purposes, such that the water so used is not discharged into the
sewer system, the quantity of water used to determine the sewer
rental shall be computed by one of the following methods:
(a) Method No. 1: by placing a meter or measuring device on the
sewer connection. The readings from this meter or measuring
device shall be used in computing the sewer rental.
(b) Method No. 2: by placing a meter or measuring device on the
effluent not discharging into the sewer system. The readings
from this meter or measuring device will then be deducted
from the total water meter readings, and the remainder will be
used in computing the sewer rental.
B. When, in the opinion of the Township, it is not practical to install meters
or measuring devices to determine the sewer rental under either
Subsection A(2) or (3) of this section, the Township may determine, in
such manner and by such method as it may prescribe, the total amount
of sanitary sewage discharged into the sewer system, and the quantity
so determined to be discharged shall be used to determine the sewer
rental. Any dispute as to the estimated quantity shall be submitted to
the Supervisors after notice of the estimate to the property owner. The
decision of the Supervisors on the matter shall be final for the current
year.
C. Measuring devices. All meters or other measuring devices not provided
by the water supplier but required to be used under the provisions of
this article shall be furnished and installed by the property owner and
shall be under the control of the Supervisors and may be tested,
inspected or repaired by Township employees whenever the
Supervisors deem necessary. The owner of the property upon which
such measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its
maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at
the property owner's expense, whether such repairs are made

necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes. Bills for such
repairs, if made by the Township, shall be due and payable at the
same time and collected in the same manner as are the bills for sewer
services; such bills from and after their due date shall constitute a lien
upon the property upon which such measuring device is installed.
D. Meter reading. The Township shall have the right to read all meters or
measuring devices, and they shall be available to Township employees
for meter reading at any reasonable time.
A. The above connection charge shall be payable upon application for
permit to make such connection. Sewer rentals or charges shall be paid

each year, beginning on such quarterly date immediately following the
quarterly calendar period on which connection is made to the sewer
system, for the quarterly calendar period or portion thereof
immediately preceding the date of the bill.
B. Payments mailed, as evidenced by the United States Post Office mark,
on or previous to the end of the period during which the bills are
payable at face will be deemed to be a payment within such period.
C. All persons connected to the sewer system must give the Township their
correct address. Failure to receive bills will not be considered an excuse
for nonpayment nor permit an extension of the period during which bills
are payable at face.
A. Quarterly charges for sewer service shall be subject to a penalty of 10%
if not paid within 30 days after the date of the bill, and the Township
shall have the right to cut off sewer service from the property where
payment has not been made and not to restore the same until all unpaid
bills against the property and the costs of cutting off and restoring
service shall have been paid.
B. All sewer rentals, together with all penalties thereon, not paid on or
before the end of six months from the date of each bill shall be deemed
to be delinquent. All delinquent sewer rentals and all penalties thereon
shall be a lien on the property served and shall be entered as a lien
against such property in the office of the Prothonotary of Montgomery
County and shall be collected in the manner provided by law for the
filing and collection of such liens.

A. This article sets uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors from East Norriton Township ("Township") into the
wastewater collection system of the East Norriton-Plymouth-Whitpain
Joint Sewer Authority ("Joint Sewer Authority") and enables the Joint
Sewer Authority to comply with all applicable state and federal laws
required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) and
the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403, as amended).
B. The objectives of this article are:
(1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Joint Sewer
Authority's wastewater collection system ("POTW") which will
interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the
resulting sludge at the POTW servicing the Township.
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
pass-through the system inadequately treated into receiving waters
or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system.
(3) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system.
(4) To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operating the
wastewater collection system.
(5) To protect the general public and treatment works personnel who
may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their
employment.
(6) To enable the Joint Sewer Authority to comply with its National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit
conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other
federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject; and to empower
the POTW to enforce penalties against violators as required by its
Enforcement Response Guide and by federal and state law.
C. This article provides for the regulations of direct and indirect
contributors to the POTW through the issuance of permits to certain
nondomestic users, and through enforcement of general requirements
for the other users; authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities;
requires user reporting; assumes that existing customer's capacity will
not be preempted; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.

(including plastics, gasoline, tar, asphalt residues, residues from
refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil), mud, glass
grinding, or polishing wastes;
(4) Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW;
(5) Wastewater having a temperature greater than 120° F. (49° C.), or
which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting
in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the
temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed
104° F. (40° C.);
(6) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through;

designated by the Superintendent in accordance with § 162-50D of
this article;
(9) Noxious or malodorous liquids (including automobile antifreeze),
gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by
interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public
nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for
maintenance or repair;
(10)Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to
the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the POTW's
NPDES permit;
§ 162-49 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-49
158:257
§ 162-49.1. Categorical pretreatment standards.
The categorical pretreatment standards now found or hereafter found at 40
CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N Parts 405-471, are hereby incorporated in
this article by reference as though set forth in full and shall apply to users,
including categorical industrial users, pursuant to the definitions set forth
in this article and as set forth in the Ordinance.
(11)Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations and the
requirements of the Joint Sewer Authority;
(12) Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate,
deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted
wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the Joint Sewer
Authority;
(13) Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes;
(14) Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the POTW in a
wastewater discharge permit;
(15)Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test or causing
noncompliance with sludge disposal requirements;
(16) Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may
cause excessive foaming in the POTW;
(17) Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in
concentrations greater than 100 mg/l;
(18)Wastewater causing two readings on an explosion hazard meter at
the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW,
of more than 5% or any single reading over 10%;
(19) Any toxic or hazardous waste that if otherwise disposed of would be
considered hazardous or toxic waste as defined in the Act or in
RCRA.
C. Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall
not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be
discharged to the POTW.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Joint Sewer Authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass
limits in accordance with § 162-49.1E and F.
B. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
§ 162-49 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-49.1
158:258
Superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable
to individual industrial users.
C. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Joint
Sewer Authority shall impose an alternate limit using the combined
waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
D. A user may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with the following subsections of this section:
(1) Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in
accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain
credit for intake pollutants must make application to the Joint
Sewer Authority. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable
standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect
credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of
Subsection D(2) of this section are met.
(2) Criteria.
(a) Either the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 CFR Subchapter N specifically provide that
they shall be applied on a net basis; or the industrial user
demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to
meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if
properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
(b) Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and
grease should not be granted unless the industrial user
demonstrates that the constituents of the general measure in
the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents
of the generic measure in the intake water or unless
appropriate additional limits are placed on process water
pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
(c) Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a
maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional
monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for
credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
(d) Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into
which the POTW discharges. The Joint Sewer Authority may
§ 162-49.1 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-49.1
158:259
waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental
degradation will result.
E. When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the Joint
Sewer Authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits with the
exception of categorical concentration-based limits for pollutants such
as pH, temperature, radiation, or any other pollutants for which mass
limits are not appropriate. The determination to convert concentration
limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Joint Sewer Authority.
The Joint Sewer Authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if
the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in § 162-49.1
E(1)(a) through (e) below.
(1) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
(a) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use
during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;
(b) Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a
substitute for treatment;
(c) Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data
from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as
the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the
actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average
production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
(d) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
(e) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the
industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(2) An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
(a) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the
equivalent mass limits.
(b) Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
(c) Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
Joint Sewer Authority whenever production rates are expected
to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates
§ 162-49.1 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-49.1
158:260
determined in Subsection E(1)(c) of this section. Upon
notification of a revised production rate, the Joint Sewer
Authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility;
and
(d) Continue to employ the same or comparable water
conservation methods and technologies as those implemented
pursuant to Subsection E(1)(c) of this section so long as it
discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
(3) When developing equivalent mass limits, the Joint Sewer Authority:
(a) Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of
the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum
and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion
factor;
(b) Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(c) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's
actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of
the implementation of water conservation methods and
technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in
the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment
pursuant to § 162-49.5. The industrial user must also be in
compliance with § 162-59C regarding the prohibition of
bypass.
F. The Joint Sewer Authority may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455
to concentration limits of the categorical pretreatment standards for
purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial
users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Joint Sewer Authority.
The Authority shall not convert such limits to concentration limits
unless it first documents that dilution is not being substituted for
treatment as prohibited by § 162-49.5.
G. Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in accordance with § 162-49.1 in lieu
of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
H. Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average,

158:261
§ 162-49.2. State pretreatment standards.
State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case
where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations,
or those in this article.
§ 162-49.3. Local limits.
limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same
production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average
and the maximum equivalent limitation.
I. Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the Joint Sewer Authority within two business days
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level
will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not
notifying the Joint Sewer Authority of such anticipated change will be
required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that
were based on the original estimate of the long-term average
production rate.
J. A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
from EPA if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its
discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by
EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
A. The Joint Sewer Authority is authorized to establish local limits
pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). The following pollutant limits are
established to protect against pass-through and interference. No
person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following
daily maximum limit:
Toxic Pollutants mg/L
Arsenic 1.165
Cadmium 0.107
Chromium (total) 0.260
Copper 5.558
Cyanide 2.328
Lead 0.969
Mercury 0.008
Molybdenum 0.418
Nickel 2.046
Selenium 11.699
Silver 7.098
Zinc 2.800
§ 162-49.1 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-49.3
158:262
§ 162-49.4. Township's right of revision.
The Township reserves the right to establish, by ordinance, more stringent
standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
§ 162-49.5. Dilution.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The Joint Sewer Authority may impose mass limitations on
users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
§ 162-49.6. Accidental discharges.
Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans
showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall
be submitted to the Joint Sewer Authority for review, and shall be approved
by the Joint Sewer Authority before construction of the facility. No user
shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental
B. The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW, which for purposes of this article includes all points within
and throughout the distribution system. All concentrations for metallic
substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The Joint
Sewer Authority may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place
of, the concentration-based limitations above.
C. The Joint Sewer Authority reserves the right to establish alternate local
limits in industrial user discharge permits, but only in accordance with
regulatory requirements. At no time will the summation of the loadings
allocated to the industrial users through the discharge permits be
greater than the allowable industrial headworks loading as determined
in the most recent local limits evaluation approved by the approval
authority.
D. The Joint Sewer Authority may develop Best Management Practices
(BMPs), by ordinance, resolution or in wastewater discharge permits to
implement local limits and the requirements of § 162.49. If a BMP is
used in place of an approved local limit or prohibition (rather than in
addition to an approved limit or prohibition), the BMP would need to be
approved by EPA prior to implementation. Authorizing use of a BMP for
compliance with one or more of the prohibitions included in 40 CFR
403.5 does not relieve the user of the responsibility of complying with
the prohibition(s).
§ 162-49.3 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-49.6
158:263
discharge procedures have been approved by the Joint Sewer Authority.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of
an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
notify the Joint Sewer Authority of the incident. The notification shall
include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and
corrective actions.
§ 162-49.7. Written notice.
Within 24 hours following an accidental discharge, the user shall notify
the Joint Sewer Authority, and within five days following an accidental
discharge, the user shall submit to the Joint Sewer Authority a detailed
written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by
this article or other applicable law.
§ 162-49.8. Notice to employees.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an
accidental discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may
cause or suffer such an accidental discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedures.
§ 162-50. Pretreatment of wastewater.
A. Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this article and shall comply with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions
set out in § 162-49 of this article within the time limitations specified by
EPA, the state, or the Joint Sewer Authority, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the Joint Sewer Authority for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Joint Sewer Authority before such facilities are constructed. The review
of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to
produce a discharge acceptable to the Joint Sewer Authority under the
provisions of this article.
B. Additional pretreatment measures.
(1) Whenever deemed necessary, the Joint Sewer Authority may
require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
§ 162-49.6 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-50
158:264
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate
sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this
article.
(2) The Joint Sewer Authority may require any person discharging into
the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their
expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued
solely for flow equalization.
(3) Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Joint Sewer Authority, they are necessary for the
proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of
grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for residential users unless a residential user who is
contributing excessive amounts of grease, oil, or sand has first
been given the opportunity to reduce the discharge by other
means. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved
by the Joint Sewer Authority and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user
at its expense, in accordance with any procedure for the
installation and maintenance of grease traps as may be established
from time to time by the Joint Sewer Authority.
(4) Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas
detection meter.
C. Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years,
the Joint Sewer Authority shall evaluate whether each significant
industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The
Joint Sewer Authority may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the Joint Sewer
Authority may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
(2) Description of stored chemicals;
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the Joint Sewer Authority of
any accidental or slug discharge, as required by § 162-53F of this
article; and
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
§ 162-50 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-50
158:265
§ 162-51. Wastewater discharge permit application.
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant
site runoff (i.e., a spill prevention plan), worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing
toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and
equipment for emergency response.
D. Hauled wastewater.
(1) Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at
locations designated by the Joint Sewer Authority and at such times
as are established by the Joint Sewer Authority. Such waste shall
not violate § 162-49 of this article or any other requirements
established by the Joint Sewer Authority. The Joint Sewer Authority
may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater
discharge permits.
(2) The Joint Sewer Authority shall require haulers of industrial waste
to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The Joint Sewer Authority
may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain
wastewater discharge permits. The Joint Sewer Authority also may
prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of
hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this
article.
(3) Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the Joint Sewer Authority. No load may be
discharged without prior consent of the Joint Sewer Authority. The
Joint Sewer Authority may collect samples of each hauled load to
ensure compliance with applicable standards. The Joint Sewer
Authority may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a
waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
(4) Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and
address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck
identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and
volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the
type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and
whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
A. Wastewater analysis. When requested by the Joint Sewer Authority, a
user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its
wastewater within five days of the request. The Joint Sewer Authority is
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically
require users to update this information.
B. Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
(1) No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from
§ 162-50 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-51
158:266
the Joint Sewer Authority, except that a significant industrial user
that has filed a timely application pursuant to § 162-51C of this
article may continue to discharge for the time period specified
therein.
(2) The Joint Sewer Authority may require other users to obtain
wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the
purposes of this article.
(3) Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out elsewhere
in this article. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not
relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and
state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state, and local law.
C. Wastewater discharge permitting: existing connections. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging
wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this article and
who wishes to continue such discharges in the future shall, within 60
days after said date, apply to the Joint Sewer Authority for an individual
wastewater discharge permit in accordance with § 162-51D of this
article and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue
after 100 days of the effective date of this article except in accordance
with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the Joint Sewer
Authority.
D. Wastewater discharge permitting: new connections. Any user required
to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or
recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior
to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for
this wastewater discharge permit, in accordance with § 162-51C of this
article, must be filed at least 60 days prior to the date upon which any
discharge will begin or recommence.
E. Wastewater discharge permit application contents.
(1) All users required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must
submit a permit application. The Joint Sewer Authority may require

accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new
written authorization satisfying the requirements of this section
must be submitted to the Joint Sewer Authority prior to or together
with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
(3) A facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial
user by the Joint Sewer Authority must annually submit the signed
certification statement in § 162-53N.
G. Wastewater discharge permit decisions. The Joint Sewer Authority will
evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional
information. Within 30 days of receipt of a complete wastewater
discharge permit application, the Joint Sewer Authority will determine
whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge permit. The Joint Sewer
Authority may deny any application for a wastewater discharge permit.
A. Wastewater discharge permit duration. A wastewater discharge permit
shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years from
the effective date of the permit. A wastewater discharge permit may be
issued for a period less than five years, at the discretion of the Joint
Sewer Authority. Each wastewater discharge permit will indicate a
specific date upon which it will expire.

term of the wastewater discharge permit; and
(h) Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Joint Sewer
Authority to ensure compliance with this article and state and
federal laws, rules, and regulations.
C. Wastewater discharge permit process.
(1) Public notification. The Joint Sewer Authority will publish in an
official government publication and/or newspaper(s) of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice with the
jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a notice to issue a pretreatment
permit, at least 30 days prior to issuance. The notice will indicate a
location where the draft permit may be reviewed and an address
where written comments may be submitted.
(2) The Joint Sewer Authority shall provide public notice of the
issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including
the user, may petition the Joint Sewer Authority to reconsider the
terms of a wastewater discharge permit within 30 days of its
issuance.
(a) Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed
to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.

wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the
reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any,
it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit.
(c) The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not
be stayed pending the appeal.
(d) If the Joint Sewer Authority fails to act within 30 days, a
request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied.
§ 162-52 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-52
158:271
Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit,
not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify
a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final
administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
(3) Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative
wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a
complaint with the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania, within the period proscribed by Pennsylvania's local
Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 105 et. seq.
D. Wastewater discharge permit modification. The Joint Sewer Authority
may modify a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including,
but not limited to, the following reasons:
(1) To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
(2) To address significant alterations or additions to the user's
operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the
time of wastewater discharge permit issuance;
(3) A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
(4) Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat
to the POTW, Joint Sewer Authority's personnel, or the receiving
waters;
(5) Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit;

discharge permit; or
(9) To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new
owner or operator.
E. Wastewater discharge permit transfer.
(1) Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner
or operator only if the permittee gives at least 60 days' advance
notice to the Joint Sewer Authority and the Joint Sewer Authority
approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to
the Joint Sewer Authority must include a written certification by
the new owner or operator which:
§ 162-52 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-52
158:272
(a) States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate
intent to change the facility's operations and processes;
(b) Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur;
and
(c) Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the
existing wastewater discharge permit.
(2) Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the
wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer.
F. Wastewater discharge permit revocation.
(1) The Joint Sewer Authority may revoke a wastewater discharge
permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following
reasons:
(a) Failure to notify the Joint Sewer Authority of significant
changes to the wastewater discharge prior to the changed
discharge;
(b) Failure to provide prior notification to the Joint Sewer
Authority of changed conditions pursuant to § 162-53E of this
article;
(c) Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application;

the facility premises and records;
(g) Failure to meet effluent limitations;
(h) Failure to pay fines;
(i) Failure to pay sewer charges;
(j) Failure to meet compliance schedules;
(k) Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater
discharge permit application;
(l) Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility; or
(m) Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this article.
(n) Failure to obtain required sewer capacity.
§ 162-52 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-52
158:273
(2) Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of
operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater
discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the
issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user.
G. Wastewater discharge permit reissuance. A user with an expiring
wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge
permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in
accordance with § 162-51 of this article, a minimum of 180 days prior to
the expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit.
H. Regulation of waste received from other jurisdictions.
(1) If another municipality, or user located within another municipality,
contributes wastewater to the POTW, the Joint Sewer Authority
shall enter into an intermunicipal agreement with the contributing
municipality.
(2) Prior to entering into an agreement required by Subsection H(1),
above, the Joint Sewer Authority shall request the following
information from the contributing municipality:
(a) A description of the quality and volume of wastewater
discharged to the POTW by the contributing municipality;
(b) An inventory of all users located within the contributing
municipality that are discharging to the POTW: and
(c) Such other information as the Joint Sewer Authority may deem
necessary.
(3) An intermunicipal agreement, as required by Subsection H(1),
above, shall contain the following conditions:
(a) A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt a
sewer use ordinance which is at least as stringent as the Joint
Sewer Authority's most recent sewer use resolution and local
limits, including required baseline monitoring reports (BMRs)
which are at least as stringent as those set out in the Joint
Sewer Authority's most recent sewer use resolution. The
requirement shall specify that such ordinance and limits must
be revised as necessary to reflect changes made to any
municipal Joint Sewer Authority's ordinance or the POTW's
local limits;
(b) A requirement for the contributing municipality to submit a
revised user inventory on at least an annual basis;
(c) A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation
activities, including wastewater discharge permit issuance,
inspection and sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted
by the contributing municipality; which of these activities will
§ 162-52 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-52
158:274
§ 162-53. Reporting requirements.
be conducted jointly by the contributing municipality and the
Joint Sewer Authority;
(d) A requirement for the contributing municipality to provide the
Joint Sewer Authority with access to all information that the
contributing municipality obtains as part of its pretreatment
activities;
(e) Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing
municipality's wastewater at the point where it discharges to
the POTW;
(f) Requirements for monitoring the contributing municipality's
discharge;
(g) A provision ensuring the Joint Sewer Authority access to the
facilities of users located within the contributing municipality's
jurisdictional boundaries for the purpose of inspection
sampling, and any other duties deemed necessary by the Joint
Sewer Authority; and
(h) A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the
terms of the intermunicipal agreement.
(4) Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Publicly Owned Treatment Works
Penalty Law (Act 9 of 1992),97 the Joint Sewer Authority reserves
the right to regulate waste entering the treatment plant regardless
of its point of origin.
(5) Each municipality which participates in the operation of the POTW
shall, in accordance with various interjurisdictional agreements
signed by them, enforce their respective sewer use ordinances with
respect to the discharges within each of their jurisdictions.
Whenever possible, the enforcement, in cooperation with the Joint
Sewer Authority, of a particular municipality's sewer use ordinance
shall be a joint and cooperative effort between the subject
municipality and staff from the Joint Sewer Authority, which has
primary responsibility for plant operations. In the event that any
municipality fails or refuses to enforce its sewer use ordinance
after the Joint Sewer Authority made a determination that such
enforcement is necessary, then the Joint Sewer Authority reserves
all rights which it may have to either undertake enforcement
pursuant to the Pennsylvania Publicly Owned Treatment Works
Penalty Law, and/or to seek enforcement of any interjurisdictional
agreement which may require the cooperation of the municipality
which fails or refuses to act.
A. Baseline monitoring reports.
97.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.
§ 162-52 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-53
158:275
(1) Within either 180 days after the date of a categorical pretreatment
standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later,
existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the POTW shall submit to the Joint Sewer Authority a
report which contains the information listed in Subsection B, below.
At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new
sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to
the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall
submit to the Joint Sewer Authority a report which contains the
information listed in Subsection B, below. A new source shall report
the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
(2) Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
(a) All information required in § 162-51D of this article.
(b) Measurement of pollutants.
[1] The user shall provide the information required in
§ 162-53;
[2] The user shall take a minimum of one representative
sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the
requirements of this subsection;
[3] Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment
exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure
the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.5(e) to
evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards.
Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this
adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the Joint Sewer Authority;
[4] Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance
with § 162-53J;
[5] The Joint Sewer Authority may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long
as the data provides information sufficient to determine
the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
[6] The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place
of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that
such sampling and analysis is representative of normal
§ 162-53 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-53
158:276
work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
POTW.
(c) Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative, as defined in § 162-48A of this
article, and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent
basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is
required to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements.
(d) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the
shortest schedule by which the user will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must
meet the requirements set out in § 162-53B of this article.
(e) Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified in accordance with § 162-51E of this
article and signed by an authorized representative, as defined
in § 162-48A of this article.
B. Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by § 162-53A(2)(d) of this
article:
(1) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required
for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such
events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing and completing construction, and
beginning and conducting routine operation);
(2) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
(3) The user shall submit a progress report to the Joint Sewer
Authority no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule
and the final date of compliance, including, at a minimum, whether
or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for
any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to
return to the established schedule; and
(4) In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Joint Sewer Authority.
§ 162-53 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-53
158:277
C. Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new
source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the Joint Sewer Authority a report
containing the information described in §§ 162-51(E)(1)(f) and
162-53(A)(2)(b) of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in
§ 162-50, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's
long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this
report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 162-51E of this article. All sampling will be done in
conformance with § 162-53.
D. Periodic compliance reports.
(1) All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by
the Joint Sewer Authority but in no case less than twice per year (in
June and December unless otherwise specified in the user's
permit), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment
standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or
pollution prevention alternative, the user, must submit
documentation required by the Joint Sewer Authority or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the user.
(2) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 162-51 of this article. In the event that the
months for submission of the reports are altered by the Joint Sewer
Authority, factors such as local high or low flow rates, holiday,
budget cycles, etc., shall be taken into consideration.
(3) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
(4) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Joint
Sewer Authority, using the procedures prescribed in § 162-53 of
§ 162-53 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-53
158:278
this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
(5) Reduced reporting.
(a) The Joint Sewer Authority may reduce the requirement for
periodic compliance reports for an industrial user subject to
Categorical pretreatment standards to a requirement to report
no less frequently than once a year, unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the EPA or state,
where the industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow
does not exceed any of the following:
[1] A value equal to 0.01% of the POTW's design dry-weather
hydraulic capacity, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is
smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow
monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in
batches;
[2] A value equal to 0.01% of the design dry-weather organic
treatment capacity of the POTW; and
[3] A value equal to 0.01% of the maximum allowable
headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard for which
approved local limits were developed in accordance with
§ 162-49.3 of this article. (By way of example, if the
POTW's maximum allowable headworks loading for copper
is five pounds, then 0.01% would be 0.0005 pounds; the
POTW would need to do this calculation for each pollutant
for which it has approved local limits.)
(b) Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have
in the last two years been in significant noncompliance, as
defined in § 162-56 of this article. In addition, reduced
reporting is not available to an industrial user with daily flow
rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so
significantly that, in the opinion of the Joint Sewer Authority,
decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user
would result in data that are not representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
(6) The industrial user must notify the Joint Sewer Authority
immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer
meet conditions of Subsection D(5)(a) through (c) of this section.
Upon notification, the industrial user must immediately begin
monitoring and reporting at least twice per year in accordance with
Subsection D(1) above.
(7) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 162-53 of this article.
§ 162-53 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-53
158:279
(8) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
(9) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section or a
user subject to the certification requirement in § 162-53N(2) of this
article monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate
sampling location more frequently than required by the Joint Sewer
Authority, using the procedures prescribed in § 162-53 of this
article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
E. Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Joint Sewer
Authority of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or
system which has the potential to alter the nature, quality, or volume of
its wastewater creating a possible slug load discharge condition at least
60 days before the change.
(1) The Joint Sewer Authority may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge
permit application under § 162-51 of this article.
(2) The Joint Sewer Authority may issue a wastewater discharge
permit under § 162-51 of this article or modify an existing
wastewater discharge permit under § 162-52 of this article in
response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(3) For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
F. Reports of potential problems.
(1) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature,
a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately
telephone and notify the Joint Sewer Authority of the incident. This
notification, shall include the location of the discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions
taken by the user, along with the identity of the person or persons
believed to be responsible for the discharge.
(2) Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Joint Sewer Authority, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to
be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
§ 162-53 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-53
158:280
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage,
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
article.
(3) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a discharge described in Subsection F(1) above. Employers
shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to
occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
G. Reports of unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Joint Sewer Authority as the Joint Sewer Authority may require.
H. Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Joint
Sewer Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Joint Sewer Authority within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to
resample if the Joint Sewer Authority monitors at the user's facility at
least once a month, or if the Joint Sewer Authority samples between the
user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this
sampling.
I. Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(1) Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the Joint Sewer Authority, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste
authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the Joint Sewer
Authority of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must
include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part
261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the Joint Sewer
Authority, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged
during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later
than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification
under this Subsection I(1) need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
§ 162-53 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-53
158:281
conditions must be submitted under § 162-53 of this article. The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants
already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of § 162-53 of
this article.
(2) Discharges are exempt from the requirements of Subsection I(1),
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more
than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes
in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes
as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
(3) In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Joint
Sewer Authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of
such regulations.
(4) In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(5) This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
J. Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, and amendments thereto,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where EPA determines that
the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for
the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by
using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling
and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Joint
Sewer Authority or other parties approved by EPA.
K. Sample collection.
(1) Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based
on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
§ 162-53 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-53
158:282
performed during the period covered by the report, based on data
that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting
period.
(2) Except as indicated in Subsection K(3) and (4) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flowproportional
composite sampling techniques, unless timeproportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Joint Sewer Authority. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Joint Sewer
Authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge.
Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite
samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Joint Sewer Authority, as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
(3) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
(4) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety-day compliance reports required in § 162-53, a minimum of
four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for
which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the Joint Sewer Authority
may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by
§ 162-53D of this article, the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
L. Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been
submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
M. Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this article and any additional records of information
obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user
independent of such requirements, including documentation associated
§ 162-53 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-53
158:283
with BMPs established under § 162-49.3. Records shall include the
date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used;
and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available
for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the
Joint Sewer Authority, or where the user has been specifically notified
of a longer retention period by the Joint Sewer Authority.
N. Certification statements.
(1) Certification of permit applications and user reports. The following
certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by
users submitting permit applications in accordance with § 162-51;
users submitting baseline monitoring reports under § 162-53; users
submitting reports on compliance with the categorical
pretreatment standard deadlines under § 162-51; and users
submitting periodic compliance reports required by § 162-53. The
following certification statement must be signed by an authorized
representative, as defined in § 162-48:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision
in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the
best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I
am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations.
(2) Annual certification for nonsignificant categorical industrial users.
A facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial
user by the Joint Sewer Authority pursuant to § 162-48 must
annually submit the following certification statement signed in
accordance with the signatory requirements in § 162-48. This
certification must accompany an alternative report required by the
Joint Sewer Authority:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment
standards under 40 CFR ___, I certify that, to the best of my
knowledge and belief that during the period from ___, ____ to ___,
___ [months, days, year]:
(a) The facility described as _____ [facility name] met the definition
of a nonsignificant categorical industrial user as described in
§ 162-48;
§ 162-53 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-53
158:284
§ 162-54. Compliance monitoring.
(b) The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements during this reporting period; and
(c) The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting
period.
This compliance certification is based on the following
information.
A. Right of entry: inspection and sampling. The Joint Sewer Authority shall
have the right to enter the premises of any user, without notice, to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this
article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.
Users shall allow the Joint Sewer Authority ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
User water use may be relied upon if discharge monitoring data is not
available.
(1) Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Joint Sewer
Authority will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes
of performing specific responsibilities.
(2) The Joint Sewer Authority shall have the right to set up on the
user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's
operations.
(3) The Joint Sewer Authority may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All
devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(4) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Joint
Sewer Authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the user.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Joint Sewer Authority access
to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
§ 162-53 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-54
158:285
§ 162-55. Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the Joint Sewer Authority's inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Joint Sewer Authority, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report
that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data, as defined by 40 CFR 2.302, will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.
§ 162-56. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The Joint Sewer Authority shall publish annually, in a daily newspaper
of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the
jurisdiction served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time
during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
(6) When it would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user
to situate the monitoring facility on the user's premises, the
municipality may allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed
by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or
near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling
and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper condition at the expense of the user.
B. Search warrants. If the Joint Sewer Authority has been refused access
to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof by a user, and is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample
as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the Joint Sewer
Authority designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit
or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety
and welfare of the community, then the Joint Sewer Authority may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the District Justice in whose
jurisdiction the property is situate.
§ 162-54 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-56
158:286
noncompliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any
other industrial user that violates Subsections C, D, H or I of this section)
and shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a sixmonth
period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment
standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in
§ 162-48;
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement
including instantaneous limits, as defined by § 162-48, multiplied by the
applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for
all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement, as
defined by § 162-48 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative standard), that the Joint Sewer Authority determines
has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference
or pass-through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel
or the general public;
D. Any other discharge violation that the Joint Sewer Authority believes
has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference
or pass-through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel
or the general public;
E. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Joint Sewer
Authority's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
F. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
G. Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic selfmonitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
H. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
I. Any other violations, which may include a violation of BMPs, which the
Joint Sewer Authority determines will adversely affect the operation or
implementation of the local pretreatment program.
§ 162-56 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-57
158:287
§ 162-57. Enforcement remedies.
§ 162-57.1. Administrative remedies.
A. The Joint Sewer Authority, in conjunction with the Township, is fully
empowered to undertake all enforcement remedies set forth below in
order to assure user compliance with all state and federal laws and
regulations. The enforcement actions described herein will be
undertaken pursuant to the Joint Sewer Authority's duly adopted and
EPA-approved Enforcement Response Plan, a federally mandated
statement of policy which provides fair and even application of all
enforcement remedies to users in violation, such document being
available at all times for public inspection. In addition, the Joint Sewer
Authority retains each and every right and power granted pursuant to
the Pennsylvania Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty Law, also
known as "Act 9 of 1992,"98 in addition to any amendments thereto and
pursuant to the Civil Penalty Assessment Policy adopted by the Joint
Sewer Authority.
B. Surcharge in lieu of enforcement remedy, With respect to conventional
pollutants, the Joint Sewer Authority may, from time to time and at its
discretion, adopt a policy whereby certain specifically identified
conventional pollutants are permissibly discharged to the Joint Sewer
Authority for removal at the POTW, with the cost of such removal to be
borne by the discharger. The Joint Sewer Authority may expand or limit
the list of conventional pollutants to which this surcharge system
applies based upon the POTW's capacity/ability to effectively remove
particular conventional pollutants. In the event that a conventional
pollutant is within the scope of the surcharge system as it exists at the
time of discharge, then such conventional pollutant discharge shall not
be considered a violation of this article. However, any failure to pay the
surcharge cost for the POTW's removal of the pollutant shall itself be
considered a violation of this article and subject to enforcement action,
in addition to all generally held rights of collection.
A. Notification of violation. When the Joint Sewer Authority finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Joint Sewer Authority shall
serve upon that user a written notice of violation. The specific manner
in which such notice of violation shall be issued, and the terms and
conditions pursuant to which the user shall respond or correct the
violation complained of, shall be as set forth in the Enforcement
Response Plan. When the notice of violation includes a plan for
satisfactory correction and prevention of the violation, submission of
such plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in
this section shall limit the authority of the Joint Sewer Authority to take
98.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.
§ 162-57 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-57.1
158:288
any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
B. Consent orders. The Joint Sewer Authority may enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken
by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified
by the document. Such documents shall have the same effect as the
administrative orders authorized elsewhere in this section of the
ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable.
C. Show-cause hearing.
(1) The Joint Sewer Authority may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Joint
Sewer Authority and show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally
or by registered mail at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user.
A show-cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(2) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be presided
over by the Joint Sewer Authority Board (hereinafter "Board") as to
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the
event that any municipality fails to designate a hearing participant,
then the Joint Sewer Authority shall designate an individual to so
serve. The Board may itself conduct a hearing and take the
evidence or may designate any of its members or any officer or
employee of the Joint Sewer Authority to:
(a) Issue, in the name of the Board, notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production
of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings.
(b) Take the evidence.
(c) Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with
recommendations to the Board for action thereon.
(3) At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must
be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any
party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
§ 162-57.1 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-57.1
158:289
(4) After the Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order,
through the Joint Sewer Authority (who shall actually, issue the
order), to the user responsible for the discharge, directing that,
following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances shall have been installed or existing treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly
operated. Further orders and directives, as are necessary and
appropriate, may be issued.
(5) Any user aggrieved by the enforcement of this article may take an
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania, in accordance with the provisions of the local Agency
Law, 2 Pa. C.S.A. § 105 et seq. A failure to appeal in accordance
with the local Agency Law shall result in a waiver of all legal rights
to contest the action taken at the show-cause hearing.
D. Compliance order. When the Joint Sewer Authority finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Joint Sewer Authority may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that
the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to
the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
E. Cease-and-desist orders.
(1) When the Joint Sewer Authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past
violations are likely to recur, the Joint Sewer Authority may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
(a) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
§ 162-57.1 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-57.1
158:290
violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the
discharge.
(2) Issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
F. Administrative fines.
(1) When the Joint Sewer Authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Joint Sewer Authority
may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $25,000 or any
greater amount which might be permitted by the Publicly Operated
Treatment Works Penalty Law99 and the Joint Sewer Authority's
Civil Penalty Assessment Policy. Such fines shall be assessed on a
per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm
average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation. The actual amount of the fine in a
particular case shall account for the factors set forth in the
Enforcement Response Plan.
(2) Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days,
be assessed an additional penalty of 6% of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 6% per month. A
municipal lien against the user's property shall be filed for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
(3) Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Joint Sewer Authority to reconsider the fine along with full
payment of the fine amount within 20 days of being notified of the
fine. Where a request has merit, the Joint Sewer Authority may
convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Joint Sewer Authority
may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions,
such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(4) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
G. Emergency suspensions.
(1) The Joint Sewer Authority may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Joint Sewer Authority may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens
99.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.
§ 162-57.1 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-57.1
158:291
to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or
may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(a) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a
user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Joint Sewer Authority may take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of
the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the
POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Joint Sewer Authority may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Joint Sewer Authority that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
in § 162-57.1 of this article are initiated against the user.
(b) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed
written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the Joint Sewer Authority prior to the date of
any show-cause or termination hearing described elsewhere in
this section of the ordinance.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
H. Termination of discharge.
(1) In addition to the provisions in § 162-52 of this article, any user
who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
(a) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(c) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to
discharge;
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(e) Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 162-49.1 of this
article.
(2) Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
§ 162-57.1 of this article why the proposed action should not be
taken. Exercise of this option by the Joint Sewer Authority shall not
§ 162-57.1 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-57.1
158:292
§ 162-57.2. Judicial enforcement remedies.
be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user.
A. Injunctive relief. When the Joint Sewer Authority finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Joint Sewer Authority may
petition the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, through the
attorney for the Joint Sewer Authority, for the issuance of a temporary
or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or
other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The
Joint Sewer Authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to
conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall
not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
B. Civil penalties.
(1) A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall be liable to the Joint Sewer Authority for a maximum civil
penalty of $25,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly
or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue
for each day during the period of the violation. Such penalty may be
assessed in accordance with § 162-59 of this article.
(2) The Joint Sewer Authority may recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the
cost of any actual damages incurred by the Joint Sewer Authority.
(3) In determining the amount of civil liability, there shall be taken into
account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration
of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's
violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of
the user, and any other factor as justice requires and as set forth in
the Enforcement Response Plan.
(4) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
C. Criminal prosecution. In the event that any discharge or other violation
of this article constitutes a violation of any criminal or penal statute,
then in addition to all enforcement remedies described elsewhere in
this article, the Joint Sewer Authority or the other participating
§ 162-57.1 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-57.2
158:293
§ 162-58. Supplemental enforcement action.
municipalities shall have the unfettered right to initiate and/or assist in
any state or federal criminal proceedings as a result of such violation.
Examples of criminal conduct in connection with a violation include, but
are not limited to, knowing or intentional introduction of any substance
into the Joint Sewer Authority's POTW which causes injury to persons
or property, otherwise undertaking any act or failing to undertake any
act which recklessly endangers the well-being of the community or
plant personnel, falsification of documents required to be filed pursuant
to this article, and tampering with or otherwise rendering inaccurate a
monitoring device or similar equipment.
D. Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are
not exclusive. The Joint Sewer Authority may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement
of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Joint
Sewer Authority's Enforcement Response Plan. However, the Joint
Sewer Authority may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the Joint Sewer Authority is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.
A. Performance bonds. The Joint Sewer Authority may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to
comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond,
payable to the Joint Sewer Authority, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the Joint Sewer Authority to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
B. Liability insurance. The Joint Sewer Authority may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to
comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has
obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to
the POTW caused by its discharge.
C. Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will
only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily
demonstrated its ability to comply.
D. Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement may separately be declared as a
§ 162-57.2 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-58
158:294
§ 162-59. Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
public nuisance to the extent that it constitutes such nuisance as
defined by Pennsylvania law or municipal ordinance.
A. Upset.
(1) For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does
not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
(2) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the requirements of Subsection C, below, are met.
(3) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(a) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(b) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures; and
(c) The user has submitted the following information to the Joint
Sewer Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five days):
[1] A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
[2] The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue; and
[3] Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5) Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
§ 162-58 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-59
158:295
(6) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility
until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is
provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among
other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility
is reduced, lost, or fails.
B. Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance
with the general prohibitions in § 162-49 of this article or the specific
prohibitions in § 162-49 of this article if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or
interference and that either:
(1) A local limit designed to prevent pass-through and/or interference,
as the case may be, exists for each pollutant discharged and the
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during,
the pass-through or interference; or
(2) No local limit designed to prevent pass-through and/or
interference, as the case may be, exists, but the discharge did not
change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior
discharge when the Joint Sewer Authority was regularly in
compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
C. Bypass.
(1) For the purposes of this section:
(a) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams
from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(b) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does
not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2) A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if
it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections C
and D of this section.
(3) Notification.
§ 162-59 EAST NORRITON CODE § 162-59
158:296
(a) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Joint Sewer Authority, at least 10
days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(b) A user shall submit oral notice to the Joint Sewer Authority of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of
the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within
five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass.
The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Joint Sewer Authority may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
(4) Enforcement action; appeals.
(a) Bypass is prohibited, and the Joint Sewer Authority may
undertake an enforcement action against a user for a bypass,
unless:
[1] Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
[2] There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods
of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate backup equipment should have been installed in
the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to
prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
[3] The user submitted notices as required under Subsection
C of this section.
(b) The Joint Sewer Authority may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Joint Sewer
Authority determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in Subsection D(1) of this section.
(c) Appeal. An industrial user assessed with a civil penalty under
the terms of this section shall have the right to file an appeal to
contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the
violation, within 30 days of the assessment of the civil penalty,
pursuant to the local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 105 et seq.
(relating to administrative law and procedure). Failure to
appeal within this period shall result in a waiver of all legal
rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty.
§ 162-59 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES § 162-59
158:297
D. Assessment of civil penalties.
(1) Pursuant to the provisions of the Pennsylvania Publicly Owned
Treatment Works Penalty Law, Act 9 of 1992,100 providing for
enhanced penalty authority for publicly owned treatment works
which are authorized to enforce industrial pretreatment standards
for industrial waste discharges, and in addition to proceeding
under any other remedy available at law or equity for violation of
pretreatment standards and/or requirements, the Joint Sewer
Authority, as the operator of the POTW, may assess a civil penalty
upon an industrial user for violation of any of the terms and
provisions of this article. The penalty may be assessed whether or
not the violation was willful or negligent. The civil penalty shall not
exceed $25,000 per day for each violation, regardless of
jurisdictional boundaries. Each violation for each separate day
shall constitute a separate and distinct defense under this section.
(2) As part of any notice of assessment of civil penalties issued by the
Joint Sewer Authority to an industrial user, there shall also be
included a description of the applicable appeals process to be
followed, including the name, address and telephone number of the
person responsible for accepting such appeal, on behalf of the Joint
Sewer Authority.
(3) For purposes of this section, a single operational upset which leads
to simultaneous violations of more than one pretreatment standard
or requirement shall be treated as a single violation as required by
the federal Water Pollution Control Act.101 The Joint Sewer
Authority may, however, recover its costs for reestablishing the
operation of the treatment works in addition to any civil penalty
imposed under this section.
(4) The Joint Sewer Authority shall publicly adopt a formal, written
civil penalty assessment policy and make it publicly available. Each
industrial discharger participating in the pretreatment program
shall be given written notice of the policy. The penalty assessment
policy shall consider:
(a) Damage to air, water, land or other natural resources of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and their uses;
(b) Costs of restoration and abatement;
(c) Savings resulting to the person in consequence of the violation;
(d) History of past violations;
(e) Deterrence of future violations;

Unauthorized Connections
[Adopted 3-20-2000 by Ord. No. 419]
§ 162-84. Purpose; objectives.
It is declared that the enactment of this article is necessary for the
protection, benefit and preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the
inhabitants of this Township. The objectives of this article are to prevent
the introduction of substances other than effluent into the sewer system in
the Township and to provide a means for the Township to inspect and locate
possible sources of inflow and infiltration into its sewer system and thereby
limit the addition of extraneous water into the Township's sewer system that
may cause the system's hydraulic capacity to be exceeded.
§ 162-85. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
INFILTRATION  The water entering a sewer system and service
connections from the ground, through such means as, but not limited to,
defective pipes, pipe joints, connections or manhole walls. Infiltration does
not include, and is distinguished from, inflow.
INFLOW  The water discharged into a sewer system and service
connections from such sources as, but not limited to, roof leaders, cellar,
yard and area drains, foundation drains, cooling water discharges, drains
from springs and swampy areas, manhole covers, cross-connections from
storm sewers and combined sewers, catch basins, stormwater, surface
runoff, street washes or drainage. Inflow does not include, and is
distinguished from, infiltration.
§ 162-86. Applicability; administrative officer.
This article shall apply to all users of the Township's sewer and sewer
collection system. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Sewage
Inspection Officer of the Township shall administer, implement and enforce
the provisions of this article.

§ 162-90.1. Site-specific inspections. [Added 8-26-2003 by Ord. No.
456]
Whenever the Township or Sewage Inspection Officer has reason to believe
that any sewer pipes are cracked or otherwise defective on a property,
or that there is an unlawful discharge or unauthorized connection to the
sewer system on a property, such property shall be subject to test and
inspection. Unlawful discharges, unauthorized connections or defects found
upon such test and inspection, if any, shall be corrected as required and
within the time frame specified by the Sewage Inspection Officer at the cost
and expense of the property owner. The owner of the property shall make
all areas to be inspected available to the Sewage Inspection Officer.
A. No user shall contribute into the sewer system or cause to be
contributed, directly or indirectly, the following:
(1) Any stormwater, surface water, springwater, groundwater, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, building foundation drainage, cellar/
basement drainage and drainage from roof leader connections.
(2) Industrial waste.

No. 456]
If the property owner fails to timely repair any defect or cease unlawful
discharges or unauthorized connections, as required in writing by the
Sewage Inspection Officer, the property owner shall be subject to a
surcharge over and above the normal sewer rate equal to the ratio of wet
weather flow to dry weather flow.
§ 162-90.3. Access denial surcharge. [Added 8-26-2003 by Ord. No.
456]
If the property owner shall deny access to the property to the Sewage
Inspection Officer for either inspection of the sewer apparatus on the
property or detection of unauthorized connections or unlawful discharges,
then the property owner shall be subject to a surcharge over and above the
normal sewer rate equal to the ratio of wet weather flow to thy weather
flow.
§ 162-91. Notice.
The Sewage Inspection Officer shall contact each owner or person
responsible for the property relative to an inspection date and time.
§ 162-92. Violations and penalties.
Any person or entity alleged to have willfully or negligently failed to comply
with any provision of this article or the orders, rules and regulations issued
hereunder or directly from the Sewage Inspection Officer shall be
prosecuted before a District Justice and, upon conviction thereof, can be
subject to a fine of $1,000 per day for each violation. Each day on which a
violation shall occur or continue to occur shall be deemed to be a separate
and distinct offense.
§ 162-93. Civil penalties.
The Township Solicitor may commence an action for appropriate legal and/
or equitable relief in the Court of Common Pleas in Montgomery County
to recover civil damages, costs, reasonable attorney fees, court costs and
cost of court reporters' transcripts as well as other expenses of litigation
made necessary as a result of violations of this article or the orders, rules
and regulations issued hereunder or by the Sewage Inspection Officer to be

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 166-1. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the Township finds that:
A. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed
increases flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and
control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and floodcontrol
efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases non-pointsource
pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment causing
loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
and welfare and the protection of the people of the Township and all the
people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate maintenance of stormwater management best management
practices (BMPs) contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes
the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, increases the cost of
public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain
management and flood-control efforts in downstream communities,
reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and
increases pollution of water resources.
D. Reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal
separate storm sewer systems is fundamental to the public health,
safety, and welfare and the protection of the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
E. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
G. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Permittees are required to
enact, implement, and enforce a prohibition of nonstormwater
discharges to the permittee's regulated small municipal separate storm
sewer systems (MS4s).

§ 166-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Township and the Stony Creek/Saw Mill Run watershed by minimizing
the hazards and maximizing the benefits described in § 166-1 of this chapter
through provisions designed to:
H. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
Township.
A. Provide standards to meet NPDES MS4 permit requirements.
B. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code § 93.4a, to protect and maintain "existing
uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all
streams and to protect and maintain water quality in special-protection
streams.
C. Maintain the existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
D. Reduce accelerated erosion, scour, aggradation and degradation of
stream banks and stream beds.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
F. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
G. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
I. Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershed-wide
stormwater management and planning.
J. Provide for proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater
management facilities and all stormwater management BMPs that are
implemented within the Township.

F. Techniques described in Appendix A (Low-Impact Development
Practices) of this chapter are encouraged, because they reduce the
costs of complying with the requirements of this chapter and the state
water quality requirements.118
G. Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
notification of the adjacent property owner(s) by the developer. Such
stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.
H. Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this chapter.

(1) The Township may hear requests for waivers where it is alleged
that the stormwater management provisions of this chapter inflict
unreasonable or undue hardship upon the applicant. The waiver
request shall be in writing to the Township. The applicant shall fully
document the nature of the alleged hardship.

(2) The Township Board of Supervisors may grant a waiver from the
stormwater management provisions, provided that all of the
following findings are made in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographic or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unreasonable or undue
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances
or conditions generally created by the provisions applicable to
the stormwater management district in which the property is
located.
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformance with the stormwater management
provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a
waiver is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of
the property.
(c) That such unreasonable or undue hardship has not been
created by the applicant.
(d) That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum
waiver that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulations as set forth.
(3) In granting any waiver, the municipality may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of Pennsylvania Act 167.
O. Stormwater hotspots.
(1) If a site is designated as a hotspot, it has important implications for
how stormwater is managed. First and foremost, untreated
stormwater runoff from hotspots shall not be allowed to recharge
into groundwater where it may contaminate water supplies.
Therefore, infiltration requirements shall not apply to development
sites that fit into the hotspot category (the runoff volume must be
managed using appropriate methods). Second, a greater level of
stormwater management shall be considered at hotspot sites to
prevent pollutant washoff after construction. The Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) NPDES stormwater program requires
some industrial sites to prepare and implement a stormwater
pollution prevention plan. Below is a list of examples of designated
hotspots:
(a) Vehicle salvage yard and recycling facilities.
(b) Vehicle fueling stations.
(c) Vehicle service and maintenance facilities.
§ 166-17 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-17
163:361
(d) Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities.
(e) Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.).
(f) Industrial sites based on Standard Industrial Codes.
(g) Marinas (service and maintenance).
(h) Outdoor liquid container storage.
(i) Outdoor loading/unloading facilities.
(j) Public works storage areas.
(k) Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials, as
defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of
1976.
(l) Commercial container nursery.
(m) Other land uses and activities as designated by an appropriate
review authority.
(2) The following land uses and activities are not normally considered
hotspots:
(a) Residential streets and rural highways.
(b) Residential development.
(c) Institutional development.
(d) Office development.
(e) Nonindustrial rooftops.
(f) Pervious surfaces, except golf courses and nurseries [which
may need an integrated pest management (IPM) plan].
(3) While large highways [average daily traffic volume (ADT) greater
than 30,000] are not designated as stormwater hotspots, it is
important to ensure that highway stormwater management plans
adequately protect groundwater.
P. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
SWPAs as defined by the local municipal or water authority.
Q. Infiltration facilities shall be used in conjunction with other innovative
or traditional BMPs. stormwater control facilities, and nonstructural
stormwater management alternatives.
R. Extreme caution shall be exercised where salt or chloride (municipal
salt storage) would be a pollutant since soils do little to filter this
pollutant, and it may contaminate the groundwater. The qualified
design professional shall evaluate the possibility of groundwater

contamination from the proposed infiltration facility and perform a
hydrogeologic justification study if necessary.
S. The infiltration requirement in HQ or EV waters shall be subject to the
Department's Chapter 93 Anti-Degradation Regulations.
T. An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A detailed
hydrogeologic investigation may be required by the Township.
U. The Township shall require the applicant to provide safeguards against
groundwater contamination for land uses that may cause groundwater
contamination should there be a mishap or spill.
V. BMP operations and maintenance requirements are described in Article
V of this chapter.
A. All regulated earth disturbance activities subject to permit
requirements by the DEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
B. Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by the DEP under
25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
C. Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or
adjacent to surface waters of the commonwealth, including wetlands,
subject to permit by the DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
D. Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a state
highway right-of-way or would require access from a state highway
shall be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PennDOT).
E. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam subject to permit by the DEP under 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities.
§ 166-17 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-19
163:363
§ 166-20. Water quality requirements after earth disturbance
activities.
B. The DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control
plan for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more,
under 25 Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
C. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES construction
activities permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or Conservation
District must be provided to the Township. The issuance of an NPDES
construction permit [or permit coverage under the statewide general
permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the requirements of Subsection A.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulation, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of a plan which demonstrates
compliance with state water quality requirements after construction is
complete.
B. The BMPs must be designed, implemented and maintained to meet
state water quality requirements and any other more-stringent
requirements as determined by the Township.
C. To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can be met by
BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that
post-construction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(No. 392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions;
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater
runoff; and
(3) Stream bank and stream bed protection: management of volume
and rate of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
D. The DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation and maintenance of best management practices
§ 166-19 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-20
163:364
§ 166-21. Volume controls.
The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual shall
be utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable.
Unless exempted from meeting volume control requirements by § 166-5 of
this chapter, water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design
Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B
below. For regulated activities equal or less than one acre that do not
require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either methodology. Therefore, the applicant
may select either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated
with each methodology, and other factors.
(BMPs) that control runoff from new development and redevelopment
after regulated earth disturbance activities are complete. These
requirements include the need to implement post-construction
stormwater BMPs with assurance of long-term operations and
maintenance of those BMPs.
E. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to
the Township. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies
the requirements of Subsection A.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year frequency, twenty-fourhour
duration precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm
Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
§ 166-20 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-21
163:365
§ 166-22. Stormwater management districts.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow (i.e., the first
one inch of runoff shall not be released into the surface waters of
this commonwealth). Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff. However, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff shall be infiltrated.
(a) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the site to determine general areas of
suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration, conduct a
geotechnical investigation of subgrade stability; infiltration
may not be ruled out without conducting these tests.
(b) Provide field tests such as double-ring infiltrometer or
hydraulic conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate hydraulic
conductivity rate. Percolation tests are not recommended for
design purposes.
(c) Design the infiltration structure for the required retention
(Rev) volume based on field-determined capacity at the level of
the proposed infiltration surface.
(d) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the developer, it
must be demonstrated to the Township that the soils are
conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
A. Management of stormwater management districts.
(1) In order to implement the provisions of the Stony Creek/Saw Mill
Run Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan, developed by the
Montgomery County Planning Commission with input from the
Montgomery County municipalities and adopted by the
Montgomery County Commissioners, dated June 1, 1991
(hereinafter the "Stony Creek Plan"), the Township is hereby
divided into stormwater management districts, consistent with the
designated watersheds for the Stony Creek/Saw Mill Run
Watershed Release Rate Map developed and adopted by the
Montgomery County Planning Commission, dated October 1991
(hereinafter the "Release Rate Map"). The boundaries of the
stormwater management districts are shown on an official map
which, along with the Stony Creek Plan and the Release Rate Map,
is incorporated herein by reference and all of which are available
for inspection at the Township administrative offices.
§ 166-21 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-22
163:366
§ 166-23. Stormwater management district implementation
provisions.
(2) Three broad categories of stormwater management districts,
namely the Release Rate District, the Provisional No-Detention
District and the One-Hundred-Percent Release Rate District, shall
be applied in the Township.
B. Categories of districts. The stormwater management districts are
hereinafter divided into three groups or categories as follows:
(1) Release Rate District. Within a given district, the post-development
peak rate of stormwater runoff must be controlled to the stated
percentage of the predevelopment peak rate of stormwater runoff
in order to protect downstream watershed areas. There are
numerous Release Rate Districts which differ in the extent to which
post-development stormwater runoff must be controlled. The
release rates range from 50% to 100%, and a specific release rate
for each district is shown on the Release Rate Map and the Stony
Creek Plan.
(2) Provisional No-Detention District. These watershed areas may
discharge post-development peak stormwater runoff without
detention without adversely affecting the total watershed peak
flow. In certain instances, however, the local conveyance facilities,
which transport stormwater runoff from the site to the main
channel, may not have adequate capacity to safely transport
increased peak flows associated with no detention for a proposed
development. In those instances, the developer shall either use a
one-hundred-percent release rate control or provide increased
capacity of downstream drainage elements to convey increased
peak flows. In determining if adequate capacity exists in the local
watershed drainage network, the developer must assume that the
entire local watershed is developed per the existing current
Chapter 205, Zoning, and that all new development would use the
runoff controls specified within this chapter.
(3) One-Hundred-Percent Release Rate District. This is an area that
should use a one-hundred-percent release rate control to protect
the areas downstream of the development site. A one-hundredpercent
release rate control would result in the post-development
peak rate stormwater runoff being controlled to the
predevelopment level, as further defined in this chapter.
A. Compliance with release rate criteria. Any stormwater management
controls required by this chapter and subject to release rate criteria
(50% to 100%) shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of
the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year return
period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology set
forth in this chapter.
§ 166-22 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-23
163:367
B. Boundary criteria. The exact location of the stormwater management
district boundaries as they apply to a given development within the
Township shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using a twofoot
topographic contours provided as part of the stormwater
management plan. The district boundaries as originally drawn on the
Stony Creek Plan coincide with topographic divides or, in certain
instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a
physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (road, culvert, bridge, etc.) to the
topographic divide consistent with topography.
C. Downstream capacity analysis criteria. Any downstream capacity
analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use the
following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting peak flow
rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon
criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual, latest edition.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff peak within
their banks or to otherwise not create any hazards to persons or
property.
(3) Culverts, bridges or storm sewers or any other facilities that must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must have sufficient
capacity to pass or convey the increased flows associated with the
twenty-five-year return period event, except for facilities located
within a designated floodplain area that must be capable of passing
or conveying the one-hundred-year return period runoff. Any
facilities that constitute stream enclosures per DEP's Chapter 105
regulations shall be designed to convey the one-hundred-year
return period runoff.
D. Single release rate criteria. For a proposed development site located
within a single release rate category area, the total runoff from the site
shall meet the applicable release rate criteria. For development sites
with multiple points of concentrated runoff discharge, individual
drainage points may be designed for up to a one-hundred-percent
release rate, so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the
applicable release rate.
E. Two or more release rate criteria. For a proposed development site
located within two or more release rate category areas, the total runoff
that may be discharged at any point is limited to the predevelopment
peak rate of runoff at that point multiplied by the applicable release
rate. The control rates shall apply regardless of any grading
§ 166-23 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-23
163:368
modifications that may change the drainage area that discharges to a
given point.
F. Locations of mixed categories. For proposed development sites located
partially within a release rate category area and partially within a
provisional no-detention area, in no event shall a significant portion of
the site area subject to the release rate be drained to the discharge
point(s) located in the no-detention area.
G. No-harm option. For any proposed development site not located in a
provisional no-detention district, the developer has the option of using a
less-restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the developer
can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher
runoff rate than that specified by the plan. Proof of no harm must be
shown from the development site through the remainder of the
downstream drainage network to the confluence of the Stony Creek or
Saw Mill Run with the Schuylkill River. Proof of no harm must be shown
using the capacity criteria specified in § 166-24J of this chapter if the
downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no-harm justification. Any
no-harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the
stormwater management plan submission. Attempts to prove no harm
based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be
governed by the following provisions:
(1) The peak flow values to be used for the downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and
one-hundred-year) shall be the values from the calibrated Penn
State Runoff Model (PSRM) for the Stony Creek/Saw Mill Run
watershed. These flow values would be supplied to the developer
by the Township Engineer upon request.
(2) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as
documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in
proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total
upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity (i.e., if
the developer's site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage,
the developer may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).
(3) Developer-proposed runoff controls that would generate increased
peak flow rates at documented storm drainage problem areas
would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to
prove no harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity
improvements for the problem areas consistent with § 166-24J of
this chapter.
H. Individual lots within a subdivision. When a site is proposed to be
subdivided for the sale and development of lots on an individual basis,
either by the subdividing party or other party, the subdividing party
shall, as part of the subdivision proposal, show all provisions for
§ 166-23 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-23
163:369
§ 166-24. Calculation methodology.
stormwater control, in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter.
I. Regional or subregional detention alternatives. For certain regions
within the watershed, it may be more cost effective to provide one
control facility for an entire subarea, group of subareas or portion of a
subarea incorporating more than one development site plan to provide
an individual control facility for each development site. The initiative
and funding for any regional or subregional runoff control alternatives
are the responsibility of prospective developers. The design of any
regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of
the entire upstream watershed. The peak outflow of a regional basin
would be determined on a case-by-case basis using the hydrologic
model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream
watershed areas. "Hydrologic model" refers to the calibrated Stony
Creek/Sawmill Run version of the Penn State Runoff Model as
developed for the requirements of this chapter.
J. Capacity improvements.
(1) In certain instances, primarily within the provisional no-detention
and provisional one-hundred-percent release rate category areas,
local drainage conditions may dictate more-stringent levels of
runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire
watershed. In these instances, if the developer could prove that it
would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the
capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then the capacity
improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of
development controls on the development site. Any capacity
improvements would be designed based upon the development of
all areas tributary to the proposed improvement and the capacity
criteria specified in § 166-24C of this chapter. In addition, all new
development upstream of a proposed capacity improvement shall
be assumed to implement the applicable runoff controls consistent
with this chapter, except that all new development within the entire
subarea(s) within which the proposed development site is located
shall be assumed to implement the developer's proposed discharge
control, if any.
(2) Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional or subregional detention alternatives or to
implement a modified no-harm option which proposes specific
capacity improvements to document the validity of a less-stringent
discharge control that would not create any harm downstream.
A. Approved methodology. Stormwater runoff from all development sites
with a drainage area of greater than 200 acres shall be calculated using
a generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the NRCS
Soil Cover Complex Method. The Township may allow the use of the
§ 166-23 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-24
163:370
Rational Method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that
contain less than 200 acres. The Soil Cover Complex Method shall
be used for drainage areas greater than 200 acres. The following
computation methods may be selected by the design professional,
based on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a
particular use:
(1) TR-20 (or commercial computer package based on TR-20),
developed by the USDA and NRCS; applicable where use of full
hydrology computer model is desirable or necessary.
(2) TR-55 (or commercial computer package based on TR-55),
developed by the USDA and NRCS; applicable for land
development plans within the limitations described in TR-55.
(3) HEC-1/HEC-HMS, developed by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers; applicable where use of a full hydrologic computer
model is desirable or necessary.
(4) PSRM, developed by Penn State University; applicable where use
of a hydrologic model is desirable or necessary; simpler than TR-20
or HEC-1.
(5) Rational Method (or commercial computer package based on
Rational Method), developed by Emil Kuichling (1889); applicable
for sites less than 200 acres, or as approved by the Township.
(6) Other methods: other computation methodologies approved by the
Township.
B. All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return period storms according to the region in which they are
located as presented in the PennDOT Drainage Manual (Publication
584). If a hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1/HECHMS
is used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of
rainfall shall be 24 hours. The Alternating Block Method shown in
Figure F-1 or the SCS Type II S Curve, Figure F-3 in Chapter Appendix
F, shall be used for the rainfall distribution.
C. The following criteria shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For development and redevelopment sites, the ground cover used
in determining the existing conditions' flow rates for the developed
portion of the site shall be considered as "meadow in good
condition," unless the natural ground cover generates a lower
curve number (CN) or Rational "c" value (i.e., woods) as presented
in the PennDOT Drainage Manual (Publication 584).
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use the rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for
overland flow and return periods presented in the Region five Curves
§ 166-24 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-24
163:371
§ 166-25. Other requirements.
from the PennDOT Storm-Duration-Frequency Chart (Figure F-4).
Times of concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the
methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time
by NRCS). Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be
computed using Manning's Equation.
E. Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be obtained from the
PennDOT Drainage Manual (Publication 584).
F. Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for use
in the Rational Method shall be obtained from the PennDOT Drainage
Manual (Publication 584).
G. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning Equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient (n) shall be consistent with the PennDOT Drainage Manual
(Publication 584).
H. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
I. Basin designs. The design of any stormwater detention facilities
intended to meet the requirements of this chapter shall be verified by
routing the design storm hydrograph through the facilities using the
Storage-Indication Method. The storm hydrograph shall be computed
using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph. The
Township may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph. For basins designed using the modified Rational
Method technique, the detention volume shall, at a minimum, equal the
volume derived from the approximate routing process as contained in
SCS Technical Release Number 55 (TR-55).
J. Freeboard requirements. All stormwater detention facilities shall
provide a minimum of one foot of freeboard above the maximum pool
elevation associated with the two-year through twenty-five-year events.
An emergency spillway shall be designed to pass the one-hundred-year
runoff event with a minimum six-inch freeboard.
A. General.

structures as necessary to:
§ 166-24 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-25
163:372
(a) Prevent erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off or detain
and control the rate of release of surface waters.
(b) Encourage all runoff control measures to percolate the
stormwater into the ground to aid in the recharge of
groundwater.
(c) Carry surface water to the nearest adequate street, storm

facility.
(d) Take surface water from the bottom of grades, to lead water
away from springs and to avoid excessive use of cross gutters
at street intersections and elsewhere.
(e) Control the anticipated peak discharge from the property
being subdivided or developed and the existing runoff
contributed from all land at a higher elevation in the same
watershed.
(f) Maintain the adequacy of the natural stream channels.
Accelerated bank erosion shall be prevented by controlling the
rate and velocity of runoff discharge to these watercourses so
as to avoid increasing the occurrence of stream bank overflow.
(g) Preserve the adequacy of existing culverts and bridges by
suppressing the new flood peaks created by new land
development.
(2) If, in the course of preparing or reviewing the stormwater
management plan, the Township determines that off-site
improvements are necessary to satisfactorily control the
stormwater from the proposed development, the developer shall be
responsible for the off-site improvements.
(3) All stormwater detention/retention facilities and erosion and
sedimentation control measures shall be in place and functioning
prior to the creation of any impervious surface.
(4) Any term not specifically defined in § 166-10 or in the Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance of East Norriton Township121
shall have the meaning set forth in the latest edition of Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release 55, and the
National Engineering Handbook, Section 4, Hydrology.
B. Retention of existing watercourses and natural drainage features.
(1) Whenever a watercourse, stream or intermittent stream is located
within a development site, it shall remain open in its natural state
and location and shall not be piped. However, if the stream banks
are of excessive slope (steeper than 3:1), it shall be the
121. Editor's Note: See Ch. 175, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 166-25 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-25
163:373
responsibility of the developer to improve the stream banks along
the watercourse.
(2) The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the
affected landowners in a form satisfactory to the Township
Solicitor.
(3) No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to
overload existing drainage systems or create flooding or the need
for additional drainage structures on other private properties or
public lands.
C. Requirements for drainage structures and/or pipes.
(1) Drainage easements. Drainage easements to accommodate all
storm drainage requirements shall be a minimum of 20 feet in
width and shall be offered for dedication to the Township.
Easements shall be provided for all improved watercourses and
storm drainage piping that are not located within street rights-ofway.
(2) Storm drainage pipe. The minimum diameter of all storm drainage
pipe shall be 18 inches or an equivalent with equal area. No storm
drainage piping shall be permitted under buildings. The minimum
grade of piping shall be reinforced concrete and conform to
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation specifications. All
joints shall be mortared.
(3) Stormwater detention/retention. The following criteria shall be
used for design of retention/detention areas. Any reference to
detention basin shall also include retention basin.
(a) The design of stormwater detention areas shall be based upon
criteria set forth in the latest edition of Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, Technical Release 55, and the National
Engineering Handbook, Section 4, Hydrology, as published by
the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service, as revised.
(b) Detention areas shall be designed so that the time and rate of
runoff from the site, when developed at its maximum potential
use or development, will not exceed the rate of runoff for the
stormwater management district in which the site is located.
Further definitions and limitations affecting the rate of runoff
are set forth within the Stony Creek Plan and Release Rate
Map for the particular stormwater management districts.
(c) Discharge from detention basins and from detention areas
shall be designed to control the time and rate of runoff as
referred to in § 166-25C(3)(b) above and also as set forth
§ 166-25 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-25
163:374
within the stormwater management district and within the
Stony Creek Plan.
(d) If permanent ponds are used, the developer shall demonstrate,
by a report to be submitted by a Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania registered certified professional engineer, that
such ponds are designed to protect the public health and
safety.
(e) Prior to the granting of final approval of any subdivision or land
development plan, the Township must be satisfied through
contractual arrangements that all stormwater facilities will be
properly maintained.
(f) When detention basins are provided, they shall be designed to
utilize the natural contours of the land wherever possible.
When such design is impracticable, the construction of the
basin shall utilize slopes as flat as possible to blend the
structure into the terrain. All basins shall have slopes of four
horizontal to one vertical or less.
(g) Detention basins shall be designed so that they return to
normal conditions within 12 hours after the termination of the
storm, unless the Township Engineer finds that downstream
conditions may warrant other design criteria for stormwater
release.
(h) Emergency overflow facilities (emergency spillways) shall be
provided for all detention facilities.
(i) If the land of the proposed subdivision or land development
will be conveyed to two or more separate owners, the
developer shall provide written assurance and deed
restrictions to the Township that the detention basins will be
properly maintained by the owners.
(j) The detention basin area will be enclosed by a four-foot-high
chain-link fence (green) or an equal approved by the Township
Engineer constructed along the berm of the basin. A double
gate shall be provided for access of maintenance equipment.
(k) In all cases, the bottom of the detention basin shall be provided
with a pipe underdrain and outletted from the basin.
D. Design criteria.
(1) Stormwater release rate.
(a) For a proposed development site located within a single
Release Rate District, the total stormwater runoff from the site
shall meet the applicable release rate criteria. For a
development site with multiple points of concentrated
stormwater runoff discharge, individual drainage points may
§ 166-25 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-25
163:375
be designed for up to a one-hundred-percent release rate, so
long as the total stormwater runoff from the site is controlled
to the applicable release rate.
(b) For a proposed development site located within two or more
Release Rate Districts, the maximum peak rate of stormwater
runoff that may be discharged at any point is limited to the
predevelopment peak rate of runoff at that point, multiplied by
the applicable release rate. The control rates shall apply
regardless of any grading modifications that may change the
drainage area that discharges to a given point.
(c) For a proposed development site located partially within a
Release Rate District and partially within a Provisional No-
Detention District, in no event shall a significant portion of the
site area subject to the release rate control be drained to the
discharge points located in the no-detention area.
(2) The following rainfall intensities shall be used for the twenty-fourhour
Type II distribution storm with average antecedent moisture
conditions for the frequencies shown:
(a) Two-year frequency: 3.16 inches.
(b) Five-year frequency: 3.91 inches.
(c) Ten-year frequency: 4.57 inches.
(d) Twenty-five-year frequency: 5.60 inches.
(e) Fifty-year frequency: 6.53 inches.
(f) One-hundred-year frequency: 7.63 inches.
(3) All developments shall limit the rate of stormwater runoff as
previously set forth within this chapter to be in strict conformance
with the Stony Creek Plan and this section.
(4) The increased stormwater runoff which may result from
subdivision or land development shall be controlled by permanent
stormwater runoff control measures and facilities. The design for
such facilities is as follows:
(a) For the two-, five-, and ten-year storm frequencies, the control
facility must achieve the required release rate as set forth in
this section and within the Stony Creek Plan.
(b) For storms greater than a ten-year storm frequency, but up to
and including the one-hundred-year storm frequency, the
control facility must achieve a release rate of 100%.
(5) An overflow system shall be provided to carry runoff to the
detention basin when the capacity of the storm drainage pipe
system is exceeded. The overflow system shall have sufficient
§ 166-25 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-25
163:376
capacity to carry the runoff difference between the one-hundredyear-
storm peak flow rate and the capacity of the storm drain pipe.
The one-hundred-year-storm peak shall be calculated by the Soil
Cover Complex Method or by an equal method as may be approved
by the Township Engineer.
(6) Detention basins shall be designed to facilitate regular
maintenance, mowing and periodic desilting and reseeding. Basins
shall not be located within floodplains or floodplain soils. In
residential subdivisions and residential developments, shallow
broad basins shall be used.
(7) If the side slopes of the basin area exceed 3:1 over at least a fivefoot
area, a four-foot-high chain-link fence (green) shall be
required. The fence should be located on the outside of the berm or
slope. Plantings as required in this section shall be located next to
the fence on the outside to soften the appearance. If the side slopes
are less than 3:1, no fencing is required.
(8) The minimum top width of the detention basin berm shall be 10
feet. A cutoff trench (keyway) comprised of impervious material
shall be provided under all embankments that require fill material.
The cutoff trench shall be a minimum of eight feet wide and two
feet deep and have side slopes of 1:1.
(9) In order to ensure proper drainage on the floor of the basin, a
minimum grade of 2% shall be maintained for grassed areas. For
concrete channel flow, a minimum grade of 1% shall be maintained.
(10) All detention/retention basin embankments shall be placed in a
maximum of eight-inch concrete lifts to a minimum of 95% of
maximum dry density as established by the American Society for
Testing and Materials D-1557. Prior to proceeding to the next lift,
the compaction shall be checked by the Township Engineer or soils
engineer. Compaction tests will be run on the leading and the
trailing edge of the berm as well as the top of the berm.
(11) Whenever possible, the emergency spillway for detention basins
shall be constructed on undisturbed ground. In situations where
the spillway is constructed within a fill area, the emergency
spillways shall be constructed of reinforced concrete checker
blocks. All emergency spillways shall be constructed so that the
detention basin berm is protected against erosion. The minimum
capacity of all emergency spillways shall be the peak flow rate from
the one-hundred-year design storm after development. The
construction material of the emergency spillway shall extend along
the upstream and downstream berm embankment slopes. The
upstream edge of the emergency spillway shall be a minimum of
three feet below the spillway crease elevation. The downstream
slope of the spillway shall, as a minimum, extend to the toe of the
§ 166-25 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-25
163:377
berm embankment. The emergency spillway shall not discharge
over earth fill and/or easily erodible material.
(12) All stormwater management detention facilities shall provide a
minimum one foot of freeboard above the maximum pool elevation
associated with the storm event. Any emergency spillway shall be
designed to pass the one-hundred-year after-construction
stormwater runoff event with a minimum one foot of freeboard
from the design flow elevation in the emergency spillway to the top
of a settled detention basin embankment.
(13) Antiseep collars shall be installed around the pipe barrel within the
normal saturation zone of the detention basin berms. The antiseep
collars and their connections to the pipe barrel shall be watertight.
The antiseep collars shall extend a minimum of two feet beyond the
outside of the principal pipe barrel. The maximum spacing between
collars shall be 14 times the minimum projection of the collar
measured perpendicular to the pipe. A minimum of two antiseep
collars shall be installed on each pipe outlet.
(14) All outlet pipes through the basin berm shall be reinforced
concrete pipe having O-ring joints. All joints shall be mortared.
(15) Energy-dissipating devices, including, but not limited to, riprap and
endwalls, shall be placed at all basin outlets.
(16) During construction, a perforated riser pipe shall be provided at
each outlet of all detention basins for sediment control. The riser
shall be constructed of metal or concrete. The riser shall extend to
a maximum elevation of two feet below the crest elevation of the
emergency spillway. The perforated riser shall be designed so that
the rate of outflow is controlled by the pipe barrel through the
basin berm when the depth of water within the basin exceeds the
height of the riser. Circular perforations with a maximum diameter
of 1 1/2 inches shall be spaced eight inches vertically and 12 inches
horizontally on the upper 2/3 of the pipe. The perforations shall be
cleanly cut and shall not be susceptible to enlargement. All metal
risers shall be coated to prevent rust. A trash rack or similar
appurtenances shall be provided to prevent debris from entering
the riser. All risers shall have a concrete base attached with a
watertight connection. The base shall be of sufficient weight to
prevent flotation of the riser. An antivortex device, consisting of a
thin vertical plate normal to the basin berm, shall be provided on
the top of the riser.
(17) All drainage channels shall be designed to prevent erosion of the
bed and banks. The maximum permissible flow velocity shall not
exceed those outlined in the following table. Suitable stabilization
shall be provided where required to prevent erosion of the drainage
channels. Allowable water velocities shall be as follows:
§ 166-25 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-25
163:378

(18) All vegetated drainage channels shall have a maximum side slope
grade of three horizontal to one vertical.
(19) Because of the critical nature of vegetated drainage channels, the
design of all vegetated drainage channels shall, as a minimum,
conform to the design procedures outlined in the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources Erosion and Sediment
Control Handbook (April 1990, or as further revised).
(20) Access ramps (for maintenance equipment) shall be 12 feet in
width and have a maximum slope of 12 1/2% for all detention/
retention basins. These ramps shall be constructed of concrete
checker blocks on a six-inch compacted layer of PennDOT No. 2A
coarse aggregate or approved equal.
(21) The following standards shall apply to underground detention
basins:
(a) All underground storage shall be constructed of approved
culvert pipes or concrete vaults. No storage shall be permitted
within the voids of stone bedding.
§ 166-25 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-25
163:379
(b) All underground storage pipes shall meet the requirements of
storm drainage pipe as outlined in § 166-25C(2) and § 166-25L.
All underground vaults shall have a minimum wall thickness of
eight inches and be designed to withstand the anticipated
vehicular loads.
(c) If an underground detention basin is to be privately owned,
operated, and maintained, underground storage pipes may be
constructed of a material other than reinforced concrete. The
pipe and material shall meet all applicable PennDOT standards
and shall be subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
The applicant shall provide satisfactory documentation on the
strength, durability and installation requirements of the
proposed material.
(d) All pipes, regardless of material, shall be installed on a six-inch
stone bedding. The remaining backfill shall be of crushed stone
if required by the manufacturer's specification or the Township
Engineer.
(e) All parts of an underground detention basin shall lie
completely outside and be adequately separated from
proposed or existing public rights-of-way, utility easements,
foundations, wetlands and floodplains, woods and landscaping,
or other sensitive areas.
(f) The design of underground detention basins shall provide for
complete access for regular cleaning and inspection. The
design shall incorporate an emergency spillway or other failsafe
means of addressing overflow conditions.
E. General storm and surface drainage.

and to provide regulated discharge.
(b) Ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the line of
streets.
(c) Intercept stormwater runoff streets at intervals reasonably
related to the extent and grade of the area drained and to
prevent substantial flow of water across intersections.
§ 166-25 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-25
163:380
(4) Storm sewers are required and shall be placed in the right-of-way
parallel to the roadway. When located in undedicated land, they
shall be placed within an easement not less than 20 feet wide.
(5) Manholes shall be spaced not more than 300 feet apart on pipe

450 feet apart for pipe sizes greater than 24 inches in diameter.
Inlets may be substituted for manholes, on approval by the
Township Engineer, at the same spacing as required for manholes.
In no case shall inlets be spaced more than 450 feet apart.
Manholes or inlets shall be provided at all changes of direction of
storm sewer piping.
(6) Inlets and manhole cover frames shall conform to Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation specifications. At street

curved portion of the curbing. Manhole covers shall have the word
"STORM" cast in two-inch-high letters on the top of the cover.
(7) Stormwater roof drains and sump pumps shall not discharge water
directly onto a sidewalk or a street and shall be constructed to
discharge wholly to a storm sewer system.
(8) Drainage structures which drain watershed areas in excess of 1/2
square mile (320 acres) or which have a span of eight feet or more

Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources or a waiver
from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources for
all waterway openings prior to final plan approval. The cartway
width over a structure shall be as wide as the widest road
connecting with the structure, or, if the character of the road is
expected to change for the future planning, the cartway over the
structure shall be made to anticipate this condition.
F. Storm sewer design.
(1) Storm frequency.
(a) Design flow rate. The storm drain system shall be designed to
carry the ten-year peak flow rate. The design ten-year peak
flow rate into each inlet shall be indicated on the stormwater
drainage plan. The ten-year flow rate shall be determined by
the Rational Formula.
Q = C*I*A
Where:
§ 166-25 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-25
163:381
Q = Peak runoff rate measured in cubic feet per second
(cfs).
C = Runoff coefficient. The coefficient of stormwater
runoff includes many variables, such as ground
slope, ground cover, shape of drainage area, etc.
I = Intensity. Average rainfall intensity in inches per
hour for a time equal to the time of concentration.
A = Area (drainage area in acres).
(b) Overflow system. An overflow system shall be provided to carry
flow to the detention basin when the capacity of the storm
drain pipe system is exceeded. The overflow system shall be of
sufficient capacity to carry the difference between the onehundred-
year and ten-year peak flow rates.
G. Storm duration.
(1) A five-minute storm duration shall be used if the duration does not
result in a maximum expected discharge that exceeds the capacity
of a thirty-inch pipe.
(2) If a five-minute storm duration results in a pipe size exceeding 30
inches, the time-of-concentration approach shall be used in
determining storm duration.
(3) If a five-minute storm duration results in a pipe size exceeding 30
inches, within any run of pipe, the time-of-concentration approach
may be used for the sizing of pipes from that point on by adjusting
the time of concentration.
H. Additional design criteria. Additional design criteria for specific
drainage facilities are required as follows:
(1) Shoulders in cut areas (without swales).
(a) Water flowing in the shoulder shall not encroach more than 2/3
of the shoulder width during a ten-year-frequency storm of
five-minute duration.
(b) The maximum velocity as determined by Manning's Equation
shall not exceed the allowable velocities as shown in
§ 166-25D(17) for the specific type of shoulder material.
(c) Inlets shall be provided to control the shoulder encroachment
and water velocity.
I. Swales adjacent to shoulders.
(1) When swales are provided in cut areas, the water shall not
encroach upon the roadway area during a ten-year-frequency
storm of five-minute duration.
§ 166-25 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-25
163:382
(2) The maximum velocity as determined by Manning's Equation shall
not exceed the allowable velocities as shown in § 166-25D(17) for
the specific type of swale material.
J. Curbed sections.
(1) The maximum encroachment of water on the roadway pavement
shall not exceed three inches in depth at the curbline or 1/2 of a
vehicular travel lane during a ten-year-frequency storm of fiveminute
duration.
(2) Inlets shall be provided to control the encroachment of water on
the pavement.
K. Inlets.
(1) When there is a change in pipe size in the inlet, the elevation of the
top of pipes shall be the same or the smaller pipe higher. A
minimum drop of two inches shall be provided at the inlet pipe
invert elevation and the outlet pipe invert elevation.
(2) If the capacity of the shoulder, swale, curb section or depressed
median section is less than the inlet capacity, the shoulder, swale,
curb section or depressed medial section capacity shall govern
inlet spacing.
(3) Inlet capacities shall be based on a maximum flow of 5.0 cubic feet
per second.
L. Storm pipes.
(1) To facilitate the solution of Manning's Equation as applied to storm
pipes, charts are presented in Design Charts for Open Channel
Flow, prepared by the United States Department of Commerce, as
last revised, which permit a direct determination of the capacity of

M. Stormwater basin landscaping. It is the intent of this section to
conserve the value of land and buildings on surrounding properties and
neighborhoods by mitigating the visual impact of stormwater
management facilities, and to minimize soil erosion. Landscaping shall
be required in and around all stormwater management facilities with a
minimum surface area of 1,000 square feet. Basins may be natural or
maintained as described below. A planting plan shall be submitted in
accordance with the one of the following two types of landscape
treatments for stormwater basins:
(1) Landscaping for naturalized basins. The following shall apply to
basins left in a natural state, especially those in parks or large open
spaces:
(a) Basin floors. Basin floors shall be planted with wildflowers and
grasses, the intent being to create a mixed meadow of such
plantings, where appropriate. Selection of plantings should be
based on whether the area in question is usually well-drained
or permanently wet.
§ 166-25 EAST NORRITON CODE § 166-25
163:384
(b) Wet edges. Wet edges which remain wet all or most of the year
shall be planted with wildflowers, grasses and shrubs tolerant
of wet conditions. Plants to be located on rims or banks which
remain dry most of the year should be planted with species
tolerant to dry soil conditions.
(c) Wooded areas.
[1] Where basins adjoin wooded areas, trees and shrubs shall
be selected and planted so as to blend with existing
surroundings.
[2] Plantings in such areas shall be of sufficient density to
eliminate the need for mowing.
(d) Slopes.
[1] Where slopes are 30% or less, a mixture of wildflowers
and/or grasses shall be planted.
[2] No woody plant materials or trees shall be located on a
berm acting as the impoundment structure of a detention/
retention basin. Trees shall be located around the
perimeter of the downstream side of a berm a sufficient
distance from the toe of the slope to assure that the toe of
the slope is outside the dripline of the mature species
planted.
(2) Landscaping for maintained basins. The following shall be applied
for basins in developed areas where a manicured lawn is possible.
Lawn mowing shall take place at intervals sufficient to maintain the
grass ground cover at no higher than six inches.
(a) Basin floors and slopes. Basin floors and slopes shall be planted
with lawn grass and maintained as a lawn with a height of not
more than six inches.
(b) Wet areas. Low areas subject to prolonged wet conditions,
such as low-flow channels or areas with poor drainage, shall be
stabilized to allow mowing and prevent erosion. Such
stabilization may include geotextile fabrics or other porous
materials such as grass pavers or PVC stabilizers.
(c) Drainage structures in residential districts. Embankments
surrounding drainage structures, such as head- or endwalls,
are to be planted with shrubs or ornamental trees along the top
of the structure. Shrubs shall be planted three feet apart.
(d) No trees shall be located on a berm acting as the impoundment
structure of a detention/retention basin. Trees shall be located
around the perimeter of the downstream side of a berm a
sufficient distance from the toe of the slope to assure that the
§ 166-25 SHOPPING CARTS § 166-25

annul the permit and order and direct the permittee to remove
structures, equipment or property belonging to the permittee or its
contractors, or both, from the legal limits of the right-of-way and
to restore the right-of-way to its former condition. If the Township
determines that the structures, equipment or property poses a
threat to the public safety and the permittee fails to remove it after
notice from the Township to do so, the Township solicitor or his
attorneys is authorized to enter an amicable action of ejectment
and confess judgement against the permittee. The attorney is
authorized to issue forthwith a writ of possession with a clause of
fieri fascias for costs, without leave of court.
(3) At the end of a workday, an opening in the right-of-way shall be
covered, backfilled or protected under § 168-35 relating to special
conditions; subsurface operations. If work is stopped on a project,
other than at the end of a normal workday, the permittee shall
promptly backfill the opening and restore the surface, and work
may not be resumed until the permittee is prepared to proceed with
the work to its completion. If the permittee fails to backfill the
opening or proceed until completion of the work, the Township
reserves the right to do the work upon notice to the permittee,
where practicable, and shall be reimbursed for the costs by the
permittee within 30 days after receipt of the Township's invoice.
(4) If the permittee, after making an opening in the surface to place or
repair a facility or for another purpose, fails to restore a portion of
the right-of-way the Township reserves the right to do the work
upon notice to the permittee, if practicable, and the permittee shall
reimburse the Township for the costs within 30 days after receipt of

appurtenance thereto, in the area of the permitted work within two
years after the acknowledged completion of the permitted work
and there is no similar failure of the highway beyond the area of the
permitted work, the permittee has absolute responsibility to make
temporary and permanent restoration of this area unless the
permittee delivers clear and convincing evidence to the Township
office demonstrating that the highway failure was caused by
another person.
(2) In situations where the permittee has the responsibility to restore
the highway, including slope or another appurtenance thereto, the
permittee has the duty to restore the improved area in accordance
with the permit. If the permittee fails to restore the improved area
properly, the Township will have the authority to do the work at the
expense of the permittee. The permittee shall reimburse the
Township for the costs within 30 days after receipt of the
Township's invoice.
(3) The obtaining of financial security in the form and amount
acceptable to the Township to secure restoration costs does not
relieve the permittee of the restoration obligations imposed. The
obtaining of financial security will not act as a release of the
permittee from liability under principles of tort law with respect to
a failure of the highway in the permitted area occurring after the
expiration of the security. [Amended 11-18-2014 by Ord. No.
558]

by Ord. No. 567]
B. Modifications due to hardship.
(1) Modification of the requirements of one or more provisions of the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance may be granted if
the literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of the
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that
such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and
that the purpose and intent of the ordinance is observed.
(2) All requests for modification shall be in writing and shall
accompany and be a part of the application for development. The
request shall state in full the grounds and facts of
unreasonableness or hardship on which the request is based, the
provision or provisions of the ordinance involved and the minimum
modification necessary. The request for modification may be
referred to the Planning Commission for advisory comments. The
Township shall maintain a written record of all action on all
requests for modifications.
A. General.
(1) No changes shall be made in the contour of the land and no
grading, excavating, removal or destruction of the topsoil, trees or
other vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced until such
time that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been
§ 175-4 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-6
163:440
processed with and reviewed by the Township Planning
Commission or there has been a determination by the Commission
that such plans are not necessary.
(2) No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
(a) There has been a plan approved by the Board of Supervisors
that provides for minimizing erosion and sedimentation
consistent with this section, and financial security in a form
and amount acceptable to the Township is deposited with the
Township, including, but not limited to, an escrow guaranty
which will ensure installation and completion of the required
improvements; or [Amended 10-27-2015 by Ord. No. 567]
(b) There has been a determination by the Board of Supervisors
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not
necessary.
(3) Measures used to control erosion and reduce sedimentation shall
as a minimum meet the standards and specifications of the
Montgomery County Soil and Water Conservation District. The
Township Engineer, or other officials as designated, shall ensure
compliance with the appropriate specifications, copies of which are
available from the district or the Municipal Building or the
Township Secretary of East Norriton Township.
B. Performance principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
(1) Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will minimize erosion.
(2) Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
(3) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
(4) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
(5) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as possible.
(6) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
(7) The permanent (final) vegetation and mechanical erosion control
and drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
§ 175-6 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-6
163:441
(8) Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water
runoff will be mechanically retarded.
(9) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps or similar measures.
C. Grading for drainage. In order to provide more suitable sites for
building and other uses, improve surface drainage and control erosion,
the following requirements shall be met:
(1) All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding,
and all land within a development shall be graded to drain and
dispose of surface water without ponding, except where approved
by the Board.
(2) All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately handle
the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest suitable outlet, such
as a curbed street, storm drain or natural watercourse. Where
drainage swales are used to divert surface waters away from
buildings, they shall be sodded or planted as required and shall be
of such slope, shape and size as to conform to the requirements of
the Township. (See § 175-26 of this chapter.)
(3) Concentration of surface water shall only be permitted in swales or
watercourses.
(4) Excavation and fills.
(a) Cut and fill slopes shall not be steeper than 3:1 unless
stabilized by a retaining wall or cribbing, except as approved
by the Board when handled under special conditions.
(b) Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water
from damaging the outface of excavations and of the sloping
surfaces of fills.
(c) Cut and fill shall not endanger adjoining property.
(d) Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
(e) Fill shall not encroach on natural watercourses or constructed
channels.
(f) Fill placed adjacent to natural watercourses or constructed
channels shall have suitable protection against erosion during
periods of flooding.
§ 175-6 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-6
163:442
(g) Grading shall not be done in such a way so as to divert water
onto the property of another landowner without the written
consent of the Board of Supervisors and the affected property
owner.
(h) During grading operations, necessary measures for dust
control will be exercised.
(i) Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross live streams.
Provision will be made for the installation of culverts or bridges
as recommended by the Township Engineer and approved in
writing by the Board of Supervisors.
D. Responsibility.
(1) Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping vegetation,
regrading or other development, it shall be the responsibility of the
person, corporation or other entity causing such sedimentation to
remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and
watercourses and to repair any damage at his expense as quickly as
possible.
(2) Maintenance of all drainage facilities and watercourses within any
subdivision or land development is the responsibility of the
developer until they are accepted by the Township or some other
official agency, after which they become the responsibility of the
accepting agency.
(3) It is the responsibility of any person, corporation or other entity
doing any act on or across a stream, watercourse or swale or upon
the floodplain right-of-way thereof to maintain as nearly as possible
in its present state the stream, watercourse, swale, floodplain or
right-of-way during the pendency of the activity and to return it to
its original or equal condition after such activity is completed.
(4) Maintenance of drainage facilities or watercourses originating and
completely on private property is the responsibility of the owner to
their point of open discharge at the property line or at a communal
watercourse within the property.
(5) No person, corporation or other entity shall block, impede the flow
of, alter, construct any structure or deposit any material or thing or
commit any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any stream
or watercourse without having obtained prior approval from the
Township and/or the Department of Environmental Resources,
whichever is applicable.
(6) Where a subdivision or land development is traversed by a
watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage easement or rightof-
way conforming substantially to the line of such watercourses
and of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural drainage.
§ 175-6 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-6
163:443
E. Compliance with regulations and procedures.
(1) Final plans for minimizing erosion and sedimentation as approved
will be incorporated into the agreement and financial security
requirements under both § 175-37 and Article VII of this chapter.
[Amended 10-27-2015 by Ord. No. 567]
(2) The approval of plans and specifications for the control of erosion
and sedimentation shall be concurrent with the approval of the
final plats of subdivision or land development and become a part
thereof.
(3) At the time that a building permit is applied for, a review shall be
conducted by the Township Engineer to ensure conformance with
the plan as approved. During the construction, further consultative
technical assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the Township
Engineer and the Montgomery County Soil and Water Conservation
District. During this development phase, the Township Engineer
shall inspect the development site and enforce compliance with the
approved plans.
(4) Permission for clearing and grading prior to recording of plats may
be obtained under temporary easements or other conditions
satisfactory to the Township.
(5) In the event that the developer proceeds to clear and grade prior to
recording plats, without satisfying conditions specified under
Subsection E(4), the Board may revoke the approval of the
preliminary plan and require restoration to the original grade and
vegetation as equal as possible to the original natural conditions at
the developer's expense and cost. Damages to adjoining property's
owners because of the developer's action in such cases will not be
the responsibility of the Township but will be the sole responsibility
of the developer who is in violation of this chapter.

ARTICLE V
Design Standards
§ 175-16. Requirements.
The following principles of subdivision and land development, general
requirements and minimum standards of design shall be observed by the
applicant in all instances, whether or not the proposed improvements are to
be accepted by the Township:
A. All portions of a tract being subdivided shall be taken up in lots, streets,
public lands or other proposed uses so that remnants and landlocked
areas shall not be created.
B. When only a portion of a tract is being reviewed relative to subdivision
and land development, but where future subdivision or land
development is imminent, the applicant shall, subject to approval of his
plan, demonstrate that the remainder of the tract or parcel may be
subdivided or developed in conformance with the existing zoning
classification of land use in a logical and satisfactory manner.
C. Whenever a parcel of land is being subdivided for the specific purpose
of being added to an adjoining parcel of land, then such subdivision
application shall be accompanied by an executed agreement of sale
between the applicant for subdivision and the owner of the parcel to
which the subdivided parcel is to be annexed. Any such subdivision
must result in a lot or lots owned by the applicant and the adjoining
landowner which shall conform in all respects to the regulations
contained in this chapter. In the event that settlement is not held in
accordance with the agreement of sale within six months of the date of
subdivision approval, then the approval shall be voided.
D. Whenever possible, applicants shall preserve trees, groves, waterways,
scenic points, historic spots and other community assets and
landmarks.
E. Subdivisions and land developments should be laid out so as to avoid
the necessity for excessive cut or fill unless specifically warranted by
terrain or location.
F. Flood-prone areas shall not be subdivided or developed except in strict
compliance with the standards and requirements of § 175-33 of this
article.
G. Where no public water supply is available to the subdivision or land
development, the Supervisors shall require the subdivider, developer or
builder to obtain from the District Sanitarian of the Pennsylvania
Department of Health or other appropriate state agency certificates of
approval as to the quality and adequacy of the water supply proposed to
be utilized by the subdivider, developer or builder and approval of the
type of construction methods to be employed in the installation of the
individual water supply system.
§ 175-16 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-16
163:461
§ 175-17. Modifications or adjustments to standards.
H. Where the subdivision or land development is inaccessible to sanitary
sewers, the Supervisors shall require the subdivider, developer or
builder to obtain from the Sewage Enforcement Officer, the Department
of Environmental Resources or other appropriate state agency
certificates of approval of the sewage disposal facilities to be provided
by the subdivider, developer or builder.
I. Applicants shall observe the ultimate right-of-way for contiguous
existing streets as prescribed by the Official Map for the Township.135
Additional portions of the corridors for such streets shall be offered to
the government agency having jurisdiction at the time the subdivision
or land development is consummated. Applicable building setback
lines, as defined by the Township Zoning Ordinance of current
adoption,136 shall be delineated as measured from the ultimate right-ofway
street line.
J. Proposed subdivision and land development shall be coordinated with
the existing nearby neighborhood so that the community as a whole
may develop harmoniously.
K. Improvement construction requirements will be completed under
specifications of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources or other
appropriate state agency, the Montgomery County Soil and Water
Conservation District or other appropriate agency or the specifications
included herein, whichever specifications shall result in the stricter
interpretation of this chapter.
L. Construction of facilities. The subdivider, developer or builder shall,
where specified by the Township, construct and install, with no expense
to the Township, the streets, curbs, sidewalks, water mains, sanitary
and storm sewers, streetlights, fire hydrants, street signs, shade trees,
monuments and recreational facilities and other facilities and utilities
specified in this article. Construction and installation of such facilities
and utilities shall be subject to inspection by appropriate Township
officials during the progress of the work, and the subdivider shall pay
for inspection.
A. The standards of design in this article should be used to judge the
adequacy of subdivision proposals. Where, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, the literal application of these standards in
certain cases would work undue hardship or be plainly unreasonable,
the Township Planning Commission may recommend to the Board such
reasonable exceptions as will not be contrary to the public interest.
135. Editor's Note: The Official Map is on file in the Township offices and may be examined
there during regular business hours.

§ 175-17.1. Transportation impact study.
B. Modification of the requirements of one or more provisions of the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance may be granted if the
literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of the peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such
modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the
purpose and intent of the ordinance is observed.
C. All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall accompany
and be a part of the application for development. The request shall state
in full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on which
the request is based, the provision or provisions of the ordinance
involved and the minimum modification necessary. The request for
modification may be referred to the Planning Commission for advisory
comments. The Township shall maintain a written record of all action on
all requests for modifications.
A. A transportation impact study shall be undertaken for all subdivision
and land developments meeting the criteria of Subsection C below to:
(1) Enable the Township to assess the impact of a proposed
development on the local transportation system.

generating 100 new trips into or out of the site at either a.m. or
p.m. peak hour, using Institute of Transportation Engineers
standards.
D. The transportation impact study shall contain but not be limited to the
following information:
(1) General site description.
(a) The site description shall include the size, location, proposed
land uses, construction staging and completion date of the
proposed subdivision or land development. If the development
is residential, types of dwelling units and number of bedrooms
shall also be included. The general site description shall also
include probable socioeconomic characteristics of potential
site users to the extent that it may affect the transportation
needs of the site (i.e., number of senior citizens).
(b) The description shall also contain a full documentation of the
proposed internal transportation system. This description shall
include proposed internal vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian
circulation, all proposed ingress and egress locations, all
internal roadway widths and rights-of-way, parking conditions,
traffic channelization and any traffic signals or other
intersection-control devices within the site. The site design
shall be shown to maximize potential public transportation
usage to and from the development, such as providing
adequate turning radii at all access points to allow a bus to
enter the development. Bus shelter and sign locations shall be
designated where appropriate.
(2) Area conditions.
(a) The size of the study area shall extend 1/2 mile from all
property boundary lines of the proposed subdivision or land
development. Care should be taken to include in the study all
known congested locations that may be impacted by the
proposed development. A brief description of other existing

Roadways and intersection approaches experiencing Levels of
Service E or F shall be noted as congestion locations, and
improvements shall be recommended to accommodate existing
traffic conditions.
(4) Base conditions.
(a) The selection of a horizon year for which study results are to be
characterized may be directly related to local plan horizons,
development phasing (for this and other projects) or major
transportation system changes. Table 1 sets forth the
appropriate study horizon, based on the number of trips
generated by the development during the peak hour.

4. Additional years when major
area transportation
improvement is completed.
NOTE: Peak hour trips are based on trip generation.
(b) Base conditions, that is, horizon year conditions without the
subject site being developed, shall be determined for all peak
hours examined. Base condition traffic will consist of the
existing traffic expanded to the horizon year using an annual
background growth factor and traffic generated by other
proposed developments in the study area. All sources used in
developing the background growth factor should be stated.
The traffic generated by other developments in the area should
be determined from the manual, Trip Generation, Fourth
§ 175-17.1 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-17.1
163:466
Edition, 1987, or as may be amended, an Institute of
Transportation Engineers Informational Report.
(c) Capacity analyses for the base condition peak hour volumes
should be conducted according to the Highway Capacity
Manual. Levels of service shall be determined at all
intersections. This analysis will determine the adequacy of the
horizon year roadway system to serve the base condition traffic
demand. Roadways and intersection approaches experiencing
Levels of Service E or F shall be noted as congestion locations,
and improvements will be recommended to accommodate the
horizon year traffic conditions.
(5) Transportation impact of the development.
(a) The traffic generated by the proposed development shall be
determined according to the manual, Trip Generation, Fourth
Edition, 1987, or as may be amended, an Institute of
Transportation Engineers Informational Report. Where the
appropriate date is not available for the proposed subdivision
and land development use, the developer shall provide the
rates applied and document the source of the rate applied. If
the developer requests to use significantly different rates than
those given, he/she shall submit the rates and specific
justification to the Township Engineer prior to submission of
the transportation impact study for approval or denial. Trip
generation shall be conducted for average daily traffic,
highway peak hours and the land development or subdivision
peak hours. These generated volumes shall be distributed to
the study area and assigned to the existing streets and
intersections throughout the study area. Documentation of all
assumptions used in the distribution and assignment phase
shall be provided. Traffic characteristics of the site that will
cause unusual trip generation rates and/or traffic flows shall be
noted.
(b) The total future traffic demand in the study area based on full
occupancy of the proposed development shall be calculated.
This demand shall consist of the combination of the base
condition volumes and the development-generated traffic.
(c) Pedestrian volumes shall also be calculated, if applicable. If
school crossings are to be used, pedestrian volumes shall be
assigned to each crossing.
(d) An intersection capacity analysis shall be conducted for
projected conditions. If staging of the proposed development is
anticipated, calculations for each stage of completion shall be
made. This analysis shall be performed using the peak highway
hour(s) and peak development-generated hour(s) for all
intersections examined in the study area. Levels of service
§ 175-17.1 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-17.1
163:467
shall be determined at all intersections. This analysis will
determine the adequacy of the horizon year roadway system to
serve the projected traffic demand. Roadways and intersection
approaches experiencing Levels of Service E or F shall be
noted as congestion locations and improvements shall be
recommended to accommodate the projected traffic
conditions.
(e) All pedestrian crossings and access points and unsignalized
intersection approaches operating at Levels of Service E or F
shall be examined as to the feasibility of installing traffic
signals. This evaluation shall examine the feasibility of
installing a traffic signal according to both PADOT
(Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Publication 201,
Engineering and Traffic Studies, Subchapter D, Traffic Control
Restrictions) and U.S. DOT (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, United States Department of Transportation, Federal
Highway Administration) standards.
(6) Conclusions and recommended improvements.
(a) All roadways or intersection approaches operating at Levels of
Service of E or F shall be considered deficient, and specific
recommendations for the elimination of these problems shall
be listed. This listing of recommended improvements shall
include but not be limited to the following elements: internal
circulation design, site access location and design, external
street and intersection design and improvements, traffic signal
installation and operation, including signal timing, and transit
design improvements.
(b) Existing and/or future public transportation shall also be
addressed. A listing of all actions to be undertaken to increase
present public transportation usage and improve service, if
applicable, shall be included.
(c) The listing of recommended improvements for both streets and
transit shall include, for such improvement, the party
responsible for the improvement, the cost and funding of the
improvement and the proposed completion date for the
improvement.
(d) The planning agencies having jurisdiction, including but not
limited to the Township Planning Commission and/or the
Montgomery County Planning Commission, shall review the
transportation impact study to determine its adequacy in
solving any traffic problems which may occur due to the land
development or subdivision and make recommendations to the
supervisors.
(e) The Township may decide that certain improvements contained
in the study on or adjacent to the site are required for

has been filed on or after 2-1-2000, the first publication of notice of the Township's intent
to adopt this ordinance.
138. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10501-A.
§ 175-17.1 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-17.2
163:469
(2) The collection, distribution and accounting of impact fees shall be
administered by the office of the Township Manager or Secretary/
Treasurer, subject to review, oversight and control by the Board of
Supervisors.
(3) The time, method and procedure for payment of impact fees shall
be as set forth in this section.
(4) The procedure for credits against or refunds of impact fees shall be
as set forth in this section.
C. Definitions. The terms and definitions set forth in § 502-A of the Act139
are hereby adopted and incorporated in this section by reference.
D. Imposition. There is hereby enacted an impact fee to be imposed upon
new development for the purpose of off-site public transportation
capital improvements authorized by the Act and as described in the
program adopted by the Board of Supervisors. The impact fee shall
apply to all new developments or subdivisions within the transportation
service area identified herein and shall be a condition precedent to final
approval of a development or a subdivision plan or issuance of a
building permit.
E. Uses. Impact fees collected pursuant to this section shall be expended
for cost incurred for improvements attributable to new development
and designated in the Transportation Capital Improvement Plan
adopted by the Board of Supervisors in Resolution No. 1959 for
improvements within the transportation service area. Additionally, such
fees may be used for the acquisition of land and rights-of-way,
engineering, legal, planning costs and all other cost, including debt
service related to road improvements within the designated service
area, and including such proportionate amount of the Roadway
Sufficiency Analysis as is allowed under the provisions of the Act.

139. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10502-A.
§ 175-17.2 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-17.2
163:470
(1) Where intended to assist in determining the appropriate amount of
traffic impact fees, the Township may require the preparation of
special transportation studies to determine the traffic generation
or circulation patterns in new nonresidential developments only;
provided, however, that no studies may be required where the
proposed development will not require a deviation from the land
use assumptions used to create the Plan.
(2) Any such studies required by the Township shall be submitted prior
to the imposition of the impact fee and shall be considered in the
determination of the fee.
H. Applicability of impact fee. This section shall be uniformly applicable to
all development that occurs within a designated service area.
I. Imposition of impact fee. No building permit shall be issued for a
development in a designated service area, as herein defined, unless the
applicant therefore has paid the impact fee imposed by and calculated
pursuant to this section.
J. Calculation of impact fees.
(1) The impact fee for transportation capital improvements shall be
based upon the total cost of the road improvements included in the
adopted Transportation Capital Improvement Plan within the
transportation service area attributable to and necessitated by new
development within the service area as defined, divided by the
number of anticipated peak-hour trips generated by all new
development within the service area as defined, divided by the
number of anticipated peak-hour trips generated by all new
development consistent with the adopted Land Use Assumptions
and calculated in accordance with the Trip Generation Manual
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineer, fourth or
subsequent editions, which is hereby adopted by the Township, to
equal a per-trip cost for transportation improvement within the
service area.
(2) The specific impact fee for a specific new development or
subdivision within the service area or road improvements shall be
determined as of the date of preliminary land development or
subdivision approval by multiplying the per-trip cost established for
the service as determined in the Transportation Capital
Improvement Plan by the estimated number of peak-hour trips to
be generated by the new development or subdivision using
generally accepted traffic engineering standards.
(3) The Board of Supervisors may authorize or require the preparation
of a special transportation study in order to determine traffic
generation or circulation for a new nonresidential development to
assist in the determination of the amount of the transportation fee
for such development or subdivision as required in § 175-17.1,
Transportation impact study.
§ 175-17.2 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-17.2
163:471
K. Establishment of transportation service areas.
(1) The transportation service areas shall be all of East Norriton
Township.
(2) Additional transportation district areas or combinations of
transportation district subareas may be designated by the Board of
Supervisors from time to time consistent with the procedure set
forth in this section and in consideration of the following factors:
(a) The Comprehensive Plan;
(b) Any standards for adequate public facilities incorporated in the
Plan;
(c) The projected buildout and timing of development areas;
(d) The need for and cost of unprogrammed transportation
improvements necessary to support projected development;
and
(e) Such other factors as the Board of Supervisors may deem
relevant.
L. Calculation of peak hour trip fee for transportation service area. The
amount of the per-peak-hour-trip fee for the Transportation Service
Area shall be $2,123 until and unless revised or amended in accordance
with the provisions hereof and the Act, calculated in accordance with
§§ 504-A(e)(1)(iv)(c) and 505-A(a)(1) of the Act.140 This fee was
calculated as follows: [Amended 8-28-2007 by Ord. No. 500]
(1) Total cost of road improvements included in the adopted
Transportation Capital Improvement Plan attributable to and
necessitated by new development within the Transportation
Service Area including 50% of the estimated cost of improvements
to highways, roads and streets qualifying as a state highway or
portion of the rural highway system as provided in § 102 of the
State Highway Law and also the assumption was made that 50% of
funding for county owned roads would come from other sources:
$4,368,007.
(2) Prorated share of costs of Roadway Sufficiency Analysis Report
pursuant to § 502-A(d)(5) of the Act (28% x $35,000 = $9,800).
$4,368,007
+ 9,800
$4,377,807
140. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10504-A(e)(1)(iv)(C) and 53 P.S. § 10505-A(a)(1), respectively.
§ 175-17.2 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-17.2
163:472
(3) Four million three hundred seventy-seven thousand eight hundred
seven dollars divided by 2062 total per peak hour trips = $2,123
per peak hour trip.
M. Projects not contained in the Transportation Capital Improvement Plan.
Any other provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, in
accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Township may expend
transportation impact fees paid by an applicant on projects not
contained in the Transportation Capital Improvement Plan or may
provide credit against transportation impact fees for the value of any
construction projects not contained in the Transportation Capital
Improvement Plan which are performed at the applicant's expense if all
of the following criteria are met:
(1) The applicant has provided written consent for use of its collected
impact fees or provisions of such credit against the applicant's
impact fees for specific transportation projects which are not
included in the Transportation Capital Improvement Plan.
(2) The alternative transportation projects, whether highway or
multimodal, have as their purpose the reduction of traffic
congestion or the removal of vehicle trips from the roadway
network.
(3) The Township amends its Transportation Capital Improvement Plan
components required by § 504-A(e)(1)(vi) of the Act141 to provide
replacement of the collected impact fees transferred to
transportation projects outside the Transportation Capital
Improvement Plan from sources other than impact fees or
developers contributions within three years of completion of the
alternate projects to which the transferred fees were applied or for
which credit was provided. All interest earned on such funds shall
become funds of that account. The Township shall make an
accounting annually for any funds account containing impact fee
proceeds and earned interest. Such accounting shall include, but
not be limited to, the total funds collected, the source of the funds
collected, the total amount of interest accruing on such funds and
the amount of funds expended on specific transportation
improvements. Notice of the availability of the results of the
accounting shall be included and published as part of the annual
audit required of the Township. A copy of the report shall also be

N. Nonbinding impact fee estimate. Prior to making an application for a
building permit, an applicant may request a nonbinding impact fee
estimate from the Township, which shall be based upon the maximum
development potential of the site pursuant to existing zoning
regulations, unless the applicant specifies a lesser use of development.

O. Administration of impact fee.
(1) Collection of impact fee. Impact fees due pursuant to this section
shall be collected by the Township in the manner or manners
prescribed herein prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(2) Establishment of fund. Upon receipt of impact fees, the Township
Manager or Finance Director shall be responsible for the separate
and proper accounting of such fees. All such fees shall be deposited
in interest-bearing accounts in a bank authorized to receive
deposits of the Township funds. Interest earned by each account
shall be credited to that account and shall be used solely for the
purpose specified for funds of such account.
(3) Establishment and maintenance of accounts. The Township
Manager or Finance Director shall establish appropriate trust fund
accounts and shall maintain records whereby impact fees collected
can be segregated for each transportation district service area.
(4) Maintenance of records. The Township Manager or Finance
Director shall maintain and keep adequate financial records for
each such account which shall show the source and disbursement
of all revenues, which shall account for all moneys received, and
which shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from each
account shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision of
projects specified in the plan for the particular transportation
service area.
P. Method of payment. Payment of the transportation capital
improvements impact fee shall be made in cash, certified check or bank
check by the person seeking to build or develop.
Q. Credit. Any applicant who shall perform, at his own expense and with
the consent and agreement of the Board of Supervisors, off-site
improvements, as herein defined, shall be eligible for a credit from the
impact fee otherwise due in the amount of the actual cost of such offsite
improvements as defined below. Such credit shall not exceed the
amount of the impact fee.
(1) If the applicant makes such improvements, he must enter into an
agreement with the Board of Supervisors prior to the issuance of
any building permit. The agreement must establish the estimated
cost of the improvement, which shall be an amount equal to the
value of any road improvement construction which is contained in
the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan and which was
performed at the applicant's expense, the schedule for initiation
and completion of the improvement, a requirement that the
improvement be completed to Township and Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation standards and design criteria and
such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the Board
of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors must review the
improvement plan, verify cost and time schedules, determine if the
§ 175-17.2 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-17.2
163:474
improvement is an eligible improvement and determine the amount
of the applicable credit for such improvement to be applied to the
otherwise applicable impact fee prior to issuance of any building
permit. In no event shall the Board of Supervisors provide a credit
which is greater than the applicable impact fee. If, however, the
amount of the credit is calculated to be greater than the amount
of the impact fee due, the applicant may use such excess credit
toward the impact fees imposed on other building permits for
development on the same site and in the same ownership.
(2) Any such applicant shall be required to supply financial security
sufficient, in the judgment of the Township, to cover the cost of any
such improvement installed by the applicant for which credit is
sought.
(3) An applicant shall be entitled to, as a credit against impact fees, an
amount equal to the fair market value of land dedicated by the
applicant and accepted by the Township for future right-of-way,
realignment or widening of existing roadways.
R. Refunds.
(1) Impact fees collected pursuant to this section shall be refunded,
together with interest earned thereon, to the payer of the fees
under the following circumstances:
(a) In the event the Township completes or terminates the capital
improvements plan and there remain undisbursed funds, the
respective payers shall be entitled to a share of the fund
balance in the same proportion as the payer's impact fee
payment plus interest earned bears to the total impact fees
collected plus interest.
(b) In the event any specific road improvement project is
completed at a cost to the Township of less than 95% of the
budgeted cost of the road project, the Township shall refund an
amount equal to the excess budgeted cost over actual cost to
the payers, pro rata, plus accumulated interest.
(c) In the event the Township fails to commence construction
within three years of the scheduled construction date of the
project as set forth in the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan, the Township shall refund the portion of
the fee paid by a payer making written request therefor which
is attributable to said project, with accumulated interest,
provided that no refund shall be paid with respect to any
project actually begun prior to the receipt of such refund
request.
(d) In the event the development for which impact fees were paid
has not commenced prior to the expiration of the building
permit issued thereof, the impact fees paid with accumulated
§ 175-17.2 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-17.2
163:475
§ 175-18. Streets.
All new streets and culs-de-sac and widened portions of all existing rightsof-
way, intended for public use, including but not limited to state and county
roadways, shall be dedicated to the Township or other governmental body
having jurisdiction at the time of dedication, subject to final acceptance
based on compliance with the following requirements and § 175-52 of this
chapter.
interest shall be refunded to the payer. Further, if a building
permit after issuance is altered in such a way as to reduce
the indicated impact fee, the difference between the amount
indicated and the amount actually paid shall be refunded. The
payer, at his option, may roll over the impact fees attributable
to an expired building permit to cover fees incurred by a
renewal of said expired permit.
(2) With respect to refunds arising out of Subsection R(1)(a) or (b)
hereof, any funds unclaimed within one year after notice as
required by law shall be transferred to the general account of the
Township, and the payer's entitlement to said refund shall lapse. It
is the responsibility of the payer to provide the Township with the
current address of his place of business.
S. Effect of impact fee on zoning and subdivision/land development
regulations. This section shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible
use of property, density of development, previously adopted design and
improvement standards and requirements or any other aspect of the
development of land or provision of public improvements which remain
subject to applicable zoning and subdivision/land development
regulations of the Township, which shall be operative and remain in full
force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development.
T. Impact fee as additional and supplemental requirement. The impact fee
is additional and supplemental to and not in substitution of any other
requirements imposed by the Township on the development of land or
the issuance of building permits. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to alter or affect the Township's existing ordinances and
regulations regarding on-site improvements. In no event shall a
property owner be obligated to pay for transportation capital
improvements in an amount in excess of the amount calculated
pursuant to this section; provided, however, that a property owner may
be required to pay, pursuant to Township ordinances, regulations or
policies, for other public facilities in addition to the impact fee for
transportation improvements as provided herein.
U. Liberal construction. The provisions of this section shall be liberally
construed to effectively carry out its purposes which are hereby found
and declared to be in furtherance of the public health, safety, welfare
and convenience.

A. Street system.
(1) Conformance with adopted plans. The proposed street pattern shall
be properly regulated to existing streets, to the Township Plan of
Streets and to such county and state road and highway plans as
have been duly adopted by the appropriate agency.
(2) Arrangement. Streets shall be arranged in a manner to meet with
the approval of the Board, considered in relation to both existing
and planned streets and located so as to allow proper development
of surrounding properties. Secondary and through highways shall
be connected with such existing streets and highways so as to form
continuations thereof. Residential streets shall be laid out to
discourage their use as secondary streets or through highways.
(3) Conformity with topography. Streets shall be adjusted to the
contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets of
reasonable grade, alignment and drainage.
(4) Grading. The street shall be graded to the full width of the right-ofway
and provision made for slopes beyond the right-of-way in
conformance with Township specifications.
(5) Provisions of streets for future development. Access shall be given
to all lots and portions of the tract in the subdivision and to
adjacent unsubdivided territory. Streets giving such access shall be
improved to the limits of the subdivision. Remnants, reserve strips
and landlocked areas shall not be created.
(6) New streets. New streets shall be laid out to continue existing
streets at equal or greater right-of-way and cartway width, where
such continuations are reasonable and practical.
(7) Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited, unless designed
as culs-de-sac or designed for access exclusively to neighboring
tracts.
(8) Street names. Continuations of existing streets shall be known by
the same name. Names for new streets shall not duplicate or
closely resemble names of existing streets. All street names are
subject to the approval of the Board.
(9) Half streets. The dedication of half streets at the edges of a new
subdivision is prohibited. If circumstances render this
impracticable, adequate provision for the concurrent dedication of
the remaining half of the street must be furnished by the
subdivider, developer or builder. When there exists a half street in
an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided by
the proposed development.
B. Street alignment.
§ 175-18 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-18
163:477
(1) Sight distance on horizontal and vertical curves. Proper sight
distance should be provided with respect to both horizontal and
vertical alignments. Measured along the center line, this should be
500 feet for major roads, 300 feet for secondary roads and 200 feet
for local residential streets, measured at the center line and at
driver's eye height of five feet.
(2) Horizontal curves shall be used at all changes in excess of 2°. Long
radius curves shall be used rather than a series of curves
connected by short tangents. Minimum radius curves at the end of
long tangents will not be approved.
(a) Curvature. The minimum radius at the center line for
horizontal curves on major streets shall be 300 feet; for
secondary streets, 200 feet; and for rural or residential streets,
150 feet.
(b) Tangents between curves. Except for local streets, there shall
be a tangent of at least 100 feet measured at the center line
between reverse curves.
(3) Vertical curves. Vertical curves shall be used at changes in grade of
more than 1%. The length of the curve shall approximate 50 feet on
secondary streets and 25 feet on residential streets for each 1% of
change in grade. Over summits or in sumps, vertical curves shall
not produce excessive flatness in grade. The high or low point on a
vertical curve must be definitely and clearly shown.
(4) Street grades.
(a) There shall be a minimum grade of at least 1% on all streets.
(b) Maximum grades. There shall be a maximum grade of 7% on
major and secondary streets and 10% on residential streets for
distances of not more than 1,500 feet. However, grades in
excess of 5% shall be avoided wherever possible. The grade
shall be measured along the center line.
(c) Curve-grade combinations. A combination of minimum radius
horizontal curves and maximum grades will not be approved.
(d) Street intersections. The grade within 50 feet of any side of an
intersection or the outer perimeter of a cul-de-sac shall not
exceed 3%. The grade will be measured along the curbline of
the street.
(e) Street grading. All streets shall be graded to the grades shown
on the street profile and cross-section plan submitted and
approved with the preliminary plan of subdivision and land
development. They shall be inspected and checked for
accuracy by the Township Engineer.
C. Right-of-way width, paving width and curbing.
§ 175-18 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-18
163:478
(1) Classification. All streets will be classified as residential,
secondary, major or cul-de-sac and shall be governed as follows:
(a) Residential streets shall be those which are used strictly to
serve residential areas and do not serve as through streets in a
development. They shall have a minimum right-of-way width of
50 feet and shall have a minimum paved width of 30 feet.
Construction of the street, curbing and sidewalk shall be in
accordance with specifications hereinafter included in these
standards.
(b) Secondary streets shall be defined in two ways:
[1] Secondary feeder streets shall be those which are used as
connecting and through streets to serve residential areas
and to connect residential streets to collector roads and
community facilities with light traffic volumes. They shall
have a minimum right-of-way of 60 feet and shall have a
minimum paved width of 36 feet. Curbing and/or sidewalk
shall be provided as required. Construction of the street
curbing and sidewalk shall be in accordance with
specifications hereinafter included in the standards.
[2] A secondary collector street shall serve to connect feeder
streets and residential streets to other feeder roads,
community facilities and major highways with medium
traffic volume. Additionally, collector streets may also
serve business or industrial areas. They shall have a
minimum right-of-way width of 80 feet and shall have a
minimum paved width of 40 feet. The construction of the
street, curbing and sidewalk shall conform to construction
specifications hereinafter included in these standards.
(c) Major streets connect district centers or communities serving
large volumes of fast-moving through traffic. They shall have a
minimum right-of-way of 100 feet and shall have a minimum
paved width of 52 feet. The street must be provided with
curbing. Construction of the street curbing and sidewalk shall
be in accordance with specifications included hereinafter in
these standards.
(d) Cul-de-sac streets shall be those residential streets with one
end open for vehicular access and the other end terminating in
a vehicular turnaround. The circular turnaround of all culs-desac
shall be constructed with the curvature starting at a
tangent point on the right-hand side of the roadway and with
the arc curving to the left.
[1] A cul-de-sac will not be approved when a through street is
practicable.
[2] A cul-de-sac shall not be more than 500 feet in length.
§ 175-18 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-18
163:479
[3] A cul-de-sac must be a side street and not be the
permanent culmination of another street to form a fourway
intersection.
[4] A cul-de-sac shall have a right-of-way of 50 feet and shall
have a circular turnaround with a minimum right-of-way
radius of 50 feet and an outer paving radius of 40 feet.
[5] A cul-de-sac permanently terminated will not be approved
when a through street is practicable. The subdivider shall
have the burden of showing the impracticability of the
through street in order to justify a cul-de-sac.
[6] A cul-de-sac permanently or temporarily exceeding 500
feet in length may be approved by the Board if conditions
of the land so warrant.
[7] Where it is proposed that a road be constructed to an
abutting property line with the intention that such a road
will be extended onto the adjoining property at a future
date, the temporarily terminated cul-de-sac shall be
constructed the same as one permanently terminated,
including the right-of-way width. Construction of the street
curbing and sidewalk shall be in accordance with
specifications hereinafter included in these standards.
(2) Street width. The minimum widths of the right-of-way and the
paving and the requirements for curbing shall not be less than
those of an existing street of which the new street is to be a
continuation nor less than the following:
Type of Street
Right-of-
Way Width
(feet)
Paving Width

§ 175-18 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-18
163:480
NOTE: Where the subdivision fronts on an existing street, the
existing paved portion shall be extended to the required curbline.
Construction of any such widening shall be as directed by the
Township Engineer.
(a) The minimum right-of-way width for development along
existing streets will correspond with the ultimate right-of-way
for these streets.
(b) Islands and medial strips may be permitted in streets
immediately adjacent and in commercial zones. However, no
circles or circular segments shall be permitted on any street.
(c) Additional width requirements.
[1] Additional widths may be required by the Township:
[a] Where necessary for public safety and convenience.
[b] For parking in commercial or industrial areas.
[c] Where old roads do not provide the proper width, and
additional dedication is necessary.
[2] No fences, hedges, trees, shrubbery, walls, plantings or
other obstructions shall be located or permitted within the
right-of-way.
D. Street paving. All street paving must conform to the specifications
incorporated in this section of the standards and be approved by the
Township Engineer prior to acceptance by the Board. All grades,
horizontal curves intersections, sight distances and tangents shall
conform to the requirements established by this chapter and shall be
subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
(1) Subgrade.
(a) The bottom of the excavation and the top of the fill between the
outer limits of the paving or base course, when completed, will
be known as the "subgrade" and shall conform to the lines,
grade and cross sections given. The subgrade for macadam
paving shall conform to the established line, grade and cross
section as approved by the Board. The subgrade shall be solidly
compacted to a firm and unyielding state by rolling with a
minimum of a ten-ton power roller. Unstable areas shall be
removed and replaced with suitable fill and then rerolled as
required to provide a uniform even surface.
(b) After the excavation or rough grading has been performed and
all drains have been constructed, the subgrade will be fine
graded and shaped to the proper cross section. It shall be
brought to a firm unyielding surface by rolling the entire area
with an approved three-wheel power roller having a metal
§ 175-18 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-18
163:481
weight of not less than 10 tons. Solid rock, boulders, soft
clay and all spongy materials which will not consolidate under
the roller shall be removed from the subgrade to a depth
to be determined by the Township Engineer or other person
designated by the Board. The space shall be filled with suitable
material from the excavation and the subgrade rerolled until
it presents a smooth and firm surface of the proper shape and
cross section. Crown board and straight edge shall be used
for checking road and street construction. Maximum deviation
shall not exceed 1/4 inch.
(2) Shoulder.
(a) Supporting shoulder shall be constructed on all sections of
projects where a base course or pavement is to be constructed
without other permanent support along the sides. All shoulder
shall be thoroughly compacted and graded to provide drainage
from the macadam surface.
(b) Where concrete curbing is not to be constructed, shoulders are
to be constructed adjacent to the paving of the proposed road.
The width and type of construction, grade and construction
methods of these shoulders is to be determined by or must
meet the approval of the Township Engineer or other person
designated by the Board.
(3) Paving base course. The base course shall be bituminous concrete
base course.
(a) Bituminous concrete base course. Bituminous concrete base
course shall have a compressed thickness after compaction of
six inches, except in the case of roadway construction in the
Industrial or Limited Industrial Zoning Districts, where the
bituminous concrete base course shall have a compressed
thickness after compaction of eight inches and shall be
constructed in two four-inch layers. In all cases, the bituminous
concrete base course shall be constructed on a four-inch layer
of compacted 2A modified stone. The bituminous concrete base
course shall conform to the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Specifications Form 408, latest edition.
(b) Materials. Materials meeting the requirements as specified in
Section 305.2 of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Specifications Form 408, latest edition, shall be
used.
(4) Bituminous surface course ID-2. This surface course shall consist of
two courses, the binder course and the wearing course, of hotmixed,
hot-laid asphaltic concrete, constructed on a prepared base
course. The bituminous surface course shall have a total thickness
after final compaction of not less than 3 1/2 inches. The binder
course shall have a minimum thickness after compaction of two
§ 175-18 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-18
163:482
inches. The wearing course shall have a minimum thickness after
compaction of 1 1/2 inches. All street pavement cross sections,
except where superelevated for curves, will be a minimum slope
from the center of the road to the gutter of 1/4 inch per foot to a
maximum of 1/2 inch per foot.
(a) Materials. The materials for the bituminous wearing course
and the bituminous binder course shall conform to the
requirements as given in Sections 420 and 421, respectively, of
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Specifications
Form 408, latest edition.
(b) Construction methods. The bituminous binder and bituminous
wearing course shall be Type ID-2 as specified in Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Specifications Form 408, latest
edition, and shall be applied in strict accordance therewith. No
visible moisture shall be present prior to the laying of each
course. Road surface temperature shall be 50° F. or greater
prior to laying of a bituminous surface. The air temperature
shall be 40° F. or greater with the temperature rising. All
bituminous surface courses shall have a total thickness after
compression of 3 1/2 inches minimum. All edges shall be kept
straight and sharp forming a clean-cut line between finished
road and gravel shoulder where shoulder construction is used.
(c) East Norriton Township will require delivery slips for all
materials used in the construction of streets.
E. Street intersections.
(1) Number of intersections. No more than two streets shall cross at
the same point. Four-way intersections are to be avoided in the
layout when three-way or T-intersections can be utilized. When
existing streets intersect at odd angles or have more than four
approaches, the subdivider, developer or builder shall be required
to make corrective changes to eliminate the odd angle or reduce
the number of approaches to the intersection by curving the lesser
street.
(2) Minimum angle of intersection. Right-angle intersections shall be
used whenever practicable, especially when local streets empty
into major or secondary streets. There shall be no intersection
angle, measured at the center line, of less than 60° minimum.
(3) Center lines. Where center lines of residential or secondary streets
open into opposite sides of a major street within 100 feet of each
other, they shall be made to coincide by curving the minor street or
streets.
(4) Primary thoroughfares. Wherever practicable, intersections with
through highways shall be kept to a minimum and shall be located
at least 1,200 feet apart.

§ 175-19. Alleys, driveways and parking areas.
(5) Sight distance. Proper sight lines, as provided in § 175-18B(1) of
this chapter, shall be maintained at all intersections of streets.
There shall be measured along the center line a minimum clear
sight triangle of 75 feet from the point of intersection. No building,
trees, hedge, shrubbery or other obstruction whatsoever will be
permitted in this area. Any obstruction to sight shall be removed at
the time the street is graded or at the time a building or structure is
erected, whichever shall first occur.
(6) Maximum grade. Maximum grade within any intersection shall not
exceed 1%, and approaches to an intersection shall follow a
straight horizontal course for 100 feet.
(7) Approach grades. All approaches to an intersection shall not
exceed 3% for a distance of 50 feet measured from the nearest
right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
(8) Radii of pavement and right-of-way at intersections. Street
intersections shall be rounded with tangential arcs at the pavement
edge (curbline) and right-of-way lines as listed below. Where two
streets of different right-of-way widths intersect, the radii of
curvature for the widest street shall apply.

(g) In using Tables 1 through 6, the following additional
requirements shall apply:
[1] Tables 2, 4 and 6 shall be used in lieu of Tables 1, 3 and 5
only when combination traffic exceeds 5.0% of the total
traffic using the proposed driveway.
[2] Posted speeds shall be used unless operating speeds vary
from the posted speed by more than 10 miles per hour, in
which case the Township may require that operating
speeds be used.
[3] The sight distances in Tables 1 through 4 apply only when
highway grades are 0% to 3.0%, either up or down.
[a] When the highway grade in the section to be used for
acceleration, after leaving the driveway, ascends at
3.0% to 5.0%, the sight distance in the direction of
approaching ascending traffic may be increased by a
factor of 1.4.
[b] When the highway grade ascends at greater than
5.0%, the sight distance may be increased by a factor
of 1.7.
[c] When the highway grade in the section to be used for
acceleration after leaving the driveway descends at
3.0% to 5.0%, the sight distance in the direction of
approaching descending highway traffic may be
reduced by a factor of 0.6.
[d] When the road descends at greater than 5.0%, the
sight distance may be reduced by a factor of 0.5.
[4] The sight distance values in Tables 1 through 6 are
desirable for the safe operation of the driveway. Sight
distance values less than desirable will be accepted only if
it is impossible to achieve the desirable value by locating
the driveway at any point within the property frontage
boundaries. The minimum acceptable sight distance
values shall be computed from the following formula:

SSSD = Minimum safe stopping sight distance
(feet)
V Velocity of vehicle (miles per hour)
T = Perception time of motorist (average = 2.5
seconds)
f = Wet friction of pavement (average = 0.30)
g = Percent grade of roadway divided by 100
(h) If sight distance requirements as specified in this chapter
cannot be met, the Township may:
[1] Prohibit left turns by exiting vehicles;
[2] Restrict turning movements to right turns in and out of a
driveway;
[3] Require the installation of a right-turn acceleration lane or
deceleration lane;
[4] Require the installation of a separate left-run standby lane;
[5] Alter the horizontal or vertical geometry of the roadway;
or
[6] Deny access to the highway.
(i) Grade of access driveway. The grade of the access driveway
shall be constructed in the following manner:
[1] All driveways shall be constructed so as not to impair
drainage within the right-of-way, alter the stability of the
improved area or change the drainage of adjacent areas.
[2] Where a drainage ditch or swale exists, the permittee shall
install adequate pipe under the driveway in accordance
with Form 408. Drainage pipe installed under driveways
shall be at least 15 inches in diameter.
[3] The side slopes for driveway embankments within the
right-of-way shall not be steeper than 10 to 1. See Figure
6.142
[4] Grade requirements in uncurbed shoulders within the
right-of-way shall conform to Figure 1.143

(4) All driveways shall be located, designed and constructed in such a
manner as not to interfere or be inconsistent with the design,
maintenance and drainage of the highway.
(5) Access driveways should be located in such a manner that they will
not cause the following:
(a) Interference to the traveling public.
(b) A hazard to the free movement of normal highway traffic.
(c) Areas of undue traffic congestion on the highway.
(6) All frontages of 200 feet or less shall be limited to one driveway. For
multifamily residential and all nonresidential driveways, not more
than two driveways shall be permitted for any single property or
business establishment except where the frontage exceeds 300 feet
in length on any one street. Exceptions to the above may be
considered if the applicant demonstrates that there is a clear need
for additional points of access and the additional driveway will not
compromise the safe and free movement of traffic within the
property or on adjacent streets.
C. Driveways for land developments.
(1) The Board shall have the authority to approve driveways intended
for the use of two or more families, apartment developments and/or
commercial and industrial projects where usage by the occupants
§ 175-19 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-19
163:490
constitutes essentially a private street. Driveways constituting
private streets are those accessways used by two or more families
daily or 10 or more workers daily for vehicular circulation.
Driveways serving as private streets shall not be dedicated to the
Township, nor does the Township assume the responsibility for
their maintenance.
(2) Construction of driveways to be used as private streets shall
conform to minimum design standards for public streets, other
than those applicable to rights-of-way, width, curbing and shoulder
grading; provided, however, that the width of the cartway shall not
be, in any event, less than 24 feet.
(3) Location and placement of driveways serving as private streets
shall comply with Subsection B, Driveways. Additionally, provisions
for drainage and stormwater runoff shall be approved by the
Township Engineer.
(4) The owner, and all successors, of any property which is to abut any
driveway serving as a private street shall be fully responsible for
the permanent improvement of the driveway(s) and for the
maintenance thereof in a good and safe condition.
(5) The Board shall evaluate the location, placement and alignment of
driveways serving as private streets based upon the ease of
accessibility to and efficient maneuverability through the
development for protective services of fire and police.
(6) Individual lots or buildings which constitute a portion of an overall
shopping center or industrial development or subdivision shall not
have direct driveway access onto any existing public street but
rather must have access to the interior driveway system of the
shopping center development or the industrial development or
must have access to an interior street to be created at the time of
subdivision and/or land development.
D. Parking area construction.
(1) Automobile parking facilities shall be provided off street in
accordance with requirements of Chapter 205, Zoning, and this
chapter.
(2) Neither angle nor perpendicular parking along the curbs of local,
public or private access roads or streets shall be permitted, except
in the case of a CR Residential District, where off-street parking is
permitted in accordance with the provisions of that article.144 All
parking lots and bays allowing any parking other than parallel shall
be physically separated from the cartway by a minimum of seven
feet and confined by barrier curbing.
144. Editor's Note: See Art. VIII of Ch. 205, Zoning.
§ 175-19 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-19

(3) (Reserved)
(4) No less than 12 feet of open space shall be provided between the
curbline of any parking area and the outside wall of any structure.
[Amended 12-12-2017 by Ord. No. 575]
(5) Parking may be permitted within side and/or rear yards when the
side and/or rear yards abut a district zoned industrial and/or
commercial. However, no parking shall be permitted within five
feet of a side or rear property line unless formal arrangements,
satisfactory to the Township, have been made for the establishment
of common parking facilities.
(6) In commercial and industrial districts, provisions for common
parking facilities are hereby encouraged in recognition of their
increased flexibility and efficiency. Subject to formal arrangements
between the proposed users of the common parking facilities,
satisfactory to the Township, the Zoning Hearing Board may reduce
the aggregate amount of required space upon determination that
greater efficiency is effected by joint use of the common parking
area. When common parking facilities are approved, side and/or
rear yard parking requirements may be waived in order to establish
unified and continuous parking areas. In such cases, access drives
and sidewalks shall be so aligned as to maximize parking efficiency
and minimize traffic congestion. Entrances and exits must have
good visibility so that, both going in and coming out, drivers can
see and cars can be seen.
(7) Parking: [Amended 2-28-2017 by Ord. No. 571]
(a) Nonresidential: Parking stall dimensions shall be not less than
nine feet in width and 18 feet in depth and shall be marked and
striped.
(b) Residential parking stalls shall consist of a reasonably level
space available for parking of one motor vehicle, not less than
10 feet wide and having an area of not less than 200 square
feet exclusive of passageways, driveways or other means of
circulation or access. The area of each parking space shall be
computed net of any required street line or, in the case of a
private street without a designated right-of-way, shall be
calculated net of an assumed street line established seven feet
behind the edge of the cartway or face of curb.
(8) (Reserved)
(9) All dead-end parking lots shall be designed to provide sufficient
backup area for the end stalls.
(10)No less than a five-foot radius of curvature shall be permitted for
all curblines in all parking areas.

shall be arranged so that direct glare from any such light shall not
fall upon any neighboring property or streets, nor shall any highbrightness
surface of the luminaries be visible from neighboring
residential properties or from any public street.
E. Parking area landscaping. Parking lot landscaping required by this
article is intended to promote the public health, safety and welfare by
providing minimum requirements for installation of landscaped areas in
connection with parking lots and other vehicular use areas; to protect
the character and stability of residential, business, institutional and
industrial areas; and to conserve the value of land and buildings on
surrounding properties.
(1) All parking lots with 10 or more stalls shall provide at least 10% of
the internal area as planting islands or planting strips.
(2) Planting islands shall be provided at least every 15 adjacent
parking stalls.

inches, except under driveways, where they shall have a
minimum thickness of six inches. The concrete apron in the
driveway area shall be reinforced with wire six inches by six
inches, No. 9 wire (minimum). Two layers of this wire shall be
utilized, with a minimum of two-inch spacing between layers.
The wire shall be installed so that it is not closer than 1/2 inch
from the top or bottom surfaces of the driveway.
(5) Where a sidewalk does not parallel a street, it may be constructed
of materials other than concrete, such as a pozzolan base with a
bituminous wearing surface, a bituminous base with a bituminous
wearing surface, flagstone or any similar type of material;
provided, however, that specifications for such materials must be
submitted to the Engineer for his review and be subject to his
approval.
B. Curbs.
(1) Concrete curbs shall be installed along each side of every
residential, secondary or commercial street or road. Concrete
curbs shall be 18 inches deep, seven inches wide at the top and
eight inches wide at the base. The nominal distance from the top of
the curb to the flow line of the gutter shall be eight inches on
secondary, commercial, primary and residential streets. Curbing
shall be built in ten-foot lengths, and an approved expansion joint
of one-fourth-inch minimum thickness shall be used at each joint. A
combination curb and gutter may be used at the option of the
developer when approved by the Township Engineer. Where
§ 175-20 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-20
163:495
combination curb and gutter is used, it must be placed on a
minimum of four inches of crushed stone or gravel to provide
adequate drainage beneath the curb.
(2) All concrete used in the construction of improvements shall be
certified to develop a compressive stress of at least 3,300 pounds
per square inch at 28 days with certification of the mix furnished to
the Township Engineer.
(3) Concrete shall be placed in forms that are straight and securely
braced. Care shall be taken to control the water content to prevent
separation of the aggregates. All concrete shall be thoroughly
tamped into the forms. After the concrete has set sufficiently, the
form shall be removed and the exposed surface shall be rubbed to
provide an even finish. All edges shall be finished with an approved
edging tool. To provide for driveways, depressions in the curbing
may be constructed and finished during the time of pouring.
C. Handicap requirements. In all areas where sidewalks are required,
handicap ramps will be provided wherever an accessible route crosses
a curb subject to the following requirements:
(1) The least possible slope shall be used with a maximum slope of
1:12. In areas where space limitations prohibit the use of the oneto-
twelve ramp, the following slopes are acceptable:
(a) Maximum rise of six inches: slope of 1:10 to 1:12.
(b) Maximum rise of three inches: slope of 1:8 to 1:10.
(c) Slopes greater than 1:8 are prohibited.
(2) Transitions shall be flush and free of abrupt changes.
(3) The maximum slope of adjacent surfaces shall be one-to-twenty.
(4) The minimum clear width shall be 36 inches.
(5) The surface must be firm, stable and slip-resistant.
(6) In all areas where pedestrians may walk across the ramp, the sides
of the ramp shall be flared, with a maximum slope of 1:10.
(7) If the width of the walking surface at the top of the ramp is less
than 48 inches wide, the flared sides shall have a maximum slope of
1:12.
(8) Returned curbs may be used only where pedestrians would not
normally walk across the ramp.
(9) Built-up curb ramps shall be located so they do not project into
traffic lanes.

A. Length. In general, all blocks in a subdivision shall have a minimum
length of 500 feet and a maximum length of 1,200 feet unless special
conditions warrant a variance.
B. Width. Whenever practicable, blocks shall be of such width as to
provide two tiers of lots of the minimum size permitted under the
applicable zoning classification, except in the case of lots along major
thoroughfares where the lot fronts on an interior street.
C. Through lots. Double frontage lots are to be avoided and generally will
not be permitted except where reversed frontage is desired away from
a major thoroughfare to a street of lesser traffic volume.
D. Crosswalk. Crosswalks not less than 10 feet wide, and with concrete
paving not less than four feet wide, may be required where necessary to
provide access to schools, churches, parks and commercial areas. They
shall be maintained by the abutting property owners in the same
manner as sidewalks on public streets.
E. Blocks. Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the
elements of design contained in this section if the nature of the use
requires other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for
employees and customers may be required along with safe and
convenient limited access to the street system. Space for off-street
loading may also be required with similar access. Extension of streets,
railroad access rights-of-way and utilities shall be provided. The amount

of lot numbers shall not be confused with the regular house or
building numbers system based on a Township-wide plan.)
(9) Building numbers. House or building numbers shall be assigned by
the Township based on an overall street plan. Numbers will be
assigned in such a way as to allow for vacant parcels and future
development.
B. Lot grading for subdivisions and land developments.
(1) Blocks and lots. Blocks and lots shall be graded to secure proper
drainage away from buildings and to prevent the collection of
stormwater in pools. Minimum slopes of 2% away from structures
shall be required.
(2) Design. All drainage provisions shall be of such design as to carry
surface waters to the nearest practical street, storm drain or
natural watercourse. Where drainage swales are used to deliver

install such drainage structures and/or pipe which are necessary to
prevent erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off such surface
waters to the nearest practical street, storm drain or natural
watercourse.
(5) Excavation. No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in
slope than two horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more
of the following conditions:
(a) The excavation is located so that a line having a slope of two
horizontal to one vertical and passing through any portion of
the cut face will be entirely within the property lines of the
property on which the excavation is made.
(b) The material from which the excavation is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a slope steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical, and a written statement from a civil engineer, licensed
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in
erosion control, to that effect is submitted to and approved by
the Township Engineer. The statement shall set forth that the
site has been inspected and that the deviation from the slope
specified hereinbefore will not result in injury to persons or
damage to property.
(c) A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to
present or future designs of the Township of East Norriton is
provided to support the face of the excavation.
(6) Fill. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface
steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical except under
one or more of the following conditions: of the following conditions:

provided to support the face of the excavation.
(7) Slopes and fences. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a
minimum of three feet from property right-of-way line of streets or
alleys in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without
encroaching on the abutting property. All property lines where
walls or slopes are steeper than one horizontal to one vertical and
five feet or more in height shall be protected by a fence approved
by the Board.
(8) Cleanup. All lots must be kept free of any debris or nuisances
whatsoever.
(9) Roof drainage. Roof drainages shall be conveyed by downspouts
constructed under the sidewalk and through the curb or to a storm
sewer or natural watercourse if available. In no case shall sump
pump connection through a curb be allowed.
(10) Site grading plan. The Township Engineer shall require a site
grading plan in conjunction with a plan of subdivision or land
development in order to ensure compliance with the standards
contained in this § 175-22.
(a) In addition to the above-listed standards, it shall be the
responsibility of the applicant or developer to submit a detailed
site grading plan showing at least the following information:
[1] An area plan or plans describing existing and proposed
features of the 100 feet surrounding the site of the work,
including topography, existing vegetation, watercourses,
man-made features and the effects of watersheds and
other important natural features.
[2] A topographic survey of the site at a suitable scale of no
less than one inch equals 40 feet and a contour interval of
no more than two feet, prepared by a registered surveyor
or engineer, including a boundary line survey, the location
and a description of vegetative cover, including trees over
10 inches in diameter, two feet above the ground, and
other natural and man-made features. This plan shall be a
minimum size of 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches.
[3] An improvement plan of the same size and scale as set
forth in Subsection B(10)(a)[2] above, showing and
describing all proposed changes to the site, including but
not limited to cuts, fills, structures, paving, a description of
all trees to be removed and utilities (this may be combined
with a topographical survey for simple projects upon
request to and approval by the Township).
§ 175-22 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-22
163:500
[4] A grading plan of the same scale as Subsection B(10)(a)[2]
above, showing and describing all proposed changes to the
site, including but not limited to cuts, fills, structures,
paving, utilities and rights-of-way of easements.
[5] A time schedule stating the anticipated starting and
completion dates of the development sequence and the
expected date of the completion of construction of each of
the activities referred to in this § 175-22.
(b) The Township Engineer shall inspect grading activities.
Inspections shall be carried out on a random basis, except as
stated hereafter. A final inspection shall be conducted by the
Township Engineer to certify compliance with this chapter. The
applicant or developer shall notify the Township Engineer and
submit an as-built grading plan, showing all changes in the
final grading plan, within 14 days of the completion of all
activities for which a permit was issued thereunder. The
Township Engineer shall then conduct an inspection to ensure
that satisfactory compliance with requirements has been
accomplished. If the subject property, as finally graded and
constructed, does not satisfactorily conform to the final
grading plan filed with the permit applications hereunder, then
the Township Engineer shall note changes required on the asbuilt
grading plan. The applicant or developer shall correct all
noted deficiencies and submit a revised as-built grading plan
for reinspection. When the Township Engineer is satisfied that
the finally graded parcel of real property complies with all
Township requirements, he shall notify the Township Zoning
Officer, or such other authorized personnel as the Township
shall from time to time designate, that the subject lot is in
compliance with this section. No occupancy permit (temporary
or permanent) shall be issued until such time as the Township
Engineer certifies that all grading and/or stabilization has been
completed in accordance with the final grading plan.
(11) Sump pumps. Sump pumps shall be installed in all below grade
basements unless the basement area is drained by a gravity line. All
sump pumps must discharge into the underground storm drainage
system.
C. Lot siting, planting and beautification for subdivision and land
developments. In the interest of providing for the protection and
preservation of natural resources, the provisions of this article are
intended to preserve the natural amenities of the Township; protect the
public health and welfare by helping to control soil erosion and reduce
sedimentation, by providing shade from the summer sun and by
providing wind breaks from the winter winds; and encourage
landowners to develop their properties in such a way as to minimize
destruction of existing trees.
§ 175-22 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-22
163:501
(1) Limit of contract. Where the applicant is offering for dedication or
is required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or
preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a limit of
contract, which will confine excavation, earthmoving procedures
and other changes to the landscape, may be required to ensure
preservation and prevent despoliation of the character of the area
in open space.
(2) Tree preservation. The plan shall minimize the loss of trees over six
inches in caliper, tree masses and woodlands to buildings, clearing
and/or grading.
(3) Topsoil preservation. No topsoil shall be removed from the site or
used as spoil. Topsoil must be removed from the areas of
construction and stored separately. Upon completion of the
construction, the topsoil must be redistributed on the site
uniformly. All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or
planting on slopes of less than 10% and shall be stabilized by
sodding on slopes 10% or more and planted in ground cover on
slopes 20%, provided that riprap shall be utilized for banks
exceeding 25%.
(4) (Reserved)
(5) (Reserved)
(6) Preserved landscaping. Trees of six inches caliper or greater, tree
masses and woodlands preserved and protected in a living
condition may be used to fulfill the other landscape planting
requirements of this section, i.e., buffering and parking lot
landscaping and street trees, thereby reducing the amount of new
plant material required, as determined by the Township.
(7) Preservation of existing vegetation. Each mature tree over six
inches in caliper, tree mass or woodland on the site shall be
designated "to remain" or "to be removed" depending on the
following criteria:
(a) A mature tree over six inches in caliper, tree mass or woodland
shall be considered to remain only if it meets the following
criteria:
[1] The outermost branches of the tree(s) are at least two feet
from any proposed buildings, structures, paving, parking
areas or utilities (above the ground or underground).
[2] The outermost branches of the tree(s) are at least two feet
from any proposed changes in grade or drainage such as
excavations, mounding or impoundments.
§ 175-22 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-22
163:502
[3] The tree(s) are clear of any proposed sight triangles and
do not, by their location or health, pose any undue threat
to the health, safety and welfare of the community.
[4] When approved by the Board of Supervisors, trees which
have a ground area protected from any disturbance or
regrading equal to 70% of the existing canopy measured in
plan view. Roots exposed during construction must be
backfilled with clean topsoil within 24 hours.
[5] When approved by the Board of Supervisors, trees which
are transplanted using direct planting methods including a
root ball of not less than 60 inches in diameter and
installation and guying techniques in accordance with

the following schedule:
Type Season
Oaks Spring only
Maples Spring or fall
Sweet gums Spring only
Pines/spruces Spring, fall or winter
(b) A mature tree over six inches in caliper, tree mass or woodland
which does not fit the above criteria shall be designated to be
removed according to the following standards:
[1] The plan shall minimize removal of existing vegetation.
[2] It shall be incumbent on the applicant to prove that
vegetation loss is minimized by showing that no
alternative layouts are possible and that no alternative
clearing or grading plan would reduce the loss of mature
trees over six inches in caliper, tree masses and
woodlands.
[3] Trees designated to be removed shall not receive credit for
trees to remain but need not be removed if it is determined
by the applicant that special precautions/alterations to
plans can be taken during construction to save the trees.
(8) Preservation of existing vegetation during construction. Existing
vegetation shown to remain as part of the landscape plan for a land
development shall be identified in the field prior to any clearing of
the tract and physically protected throughout the construction
process. A temporary physical barrier, such as a snow fence, shall
be erected a minimum of one foot from the dripline or 15 feet from
the trunk(s), whichever is greater, on all sides of stands of
vegetation, individual mature trees over six inches in caliper and/or
woodlands shown to remain prior to major clearing or construction.

163:503
§ 175-22.1. Buffers and screens.
No disturbance, such as grading, dumping, storage, parking or
traffic, shall be allowed within the fence line, and the fence shall
remain until construction is complete. The specific method of
preserving existing vegetation shall be noted on the landscape
plan.
(9) Post construction impact. The existing natural drainage pattern,
lighting or other environmental factors shall not be altered to
seriously damage the remaining trees as determined by the
Township Engineer, Arborist or Landscape Architect.
A. Intent. The planting requirements in this section are intended to
promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing certain
minimum standards for installation of landscaped areas in connection
with new construction or reconstruction; to conserve the value of land
and buildings on surrounding properties and neighborhoods by
mitigating the visual impact of structures and other site elements; to
protect the character and stability of residential, business, institutional
and industrial areas; and to improve the microclimate of built areas.
B. General requirements.
(1) Any plantings required herein shall have two components:
(a) Property line buffers which act to integrate new development
with the surroundings.

to certain site elements located within 100 feet of property
lines or road rights-of-way (either public or private).
(2) An on-site investigation by the applicant shall determine the
adjacent land uses along each property boundary or road
classification for each existing right-of-way. In the case of vacant
land, the existing zoning district shall be used. These existing or
zoned uses shall be noted on the plan.
(3) Property line buffers shall be required on the applicant's property
for all nonresidential and single-family attached or multifamily
(including high-rise) residential land developments. The amount
and type of plant material required shall be determined by the
intensity of the proposed land use and the existing adjacent land
use (or adjacent zoning district for vacant land). Subsection C
below shall apply.
(4) Screening of site elements shall be required in all proposed land
developments around certain site elements as specified in this
section which are located partially or fully within 100 feet of the
property line or existing road right-of-way. The type of site element
screen shall be determined by the site element and the adjacent

and noted on the landscape plan and may be substituted for part or
all of the required property line buffers or site element screens at
the discretion of the Township Supervisors upon the
recommendation of the Township Landscape Architect, Engineer or
Arborist. The minimum quantity and visual effect of the existing
vegetation shall be equal to or exceed that of the required buffer or
screen. If the effect of the existing vegetation does not equal or
exceed that of the required buffer or screen, additional plantings
shall be required according to the provisions of this section.
(6) Existing topographic conditions, such as cliffs or berms, may be
substituted for part or all of the required property line buffers or
site element screens with the approval of the Township Supervisors
upon the recommendation of the Township Landscape Architect,
Engineer or Arborist. The minimum visual effect of the existing
topographical conditions shall be equal to or exceed that of the
required buffers or screens. If the effect of the existing
topographical conditions does not equal or exceed that of the
required buffer or screen, additional plantings shall be required
according to the provisions of this section.

connected to the Township sanitary sewer system. In areas not
presently served by public sanitary sewers, the Township shall require,
according to Act No. 537 passed by the General Assembly of
Pennsylvania (1965),150 in addition to installation of temporary
individual on-site sewage disposal facilities, the installation and
capping of sanitary sewer mains and house connections, if studies by
the Board indicate that extension of public sanitary sewer trunks or
lateral to serve the property subdivided appears probable or necessary
to protect public health.
(1) When a feasibility analysis, conducted by the Township Engineer,
local engineer and District Sanitarian, has ascertained that
sanitary sewers are practicable, then sanitary sewers, with
connection to each building in a subdivision or land development,
shall be installed at the expense of the applicant or subdivider and
connected to the Township sanitary sewer system.
(2) If outfall sewers are not available in the vicinity but are considered
reasonably necessary in the near future by the Township or
Pennsylvania Department of Health or other appropriate state
agency for the area in question, a system of sewers, together with
all necessary laterals extending from mains to the street right-ofway
line, shall be installed at the expense of the subdivider or
applicant. The sewer lines shall be suitably capped at the limits of
the subdivision or land development, and the laterals shall be
capped at the right-of-way. The sewer installations shall include the
construction within rights-of-way or easements to bring the sewer
to the future connection with the Township sanitary sewer system.
(3) If sanitary sewers are not to be installed at the time of subdivision
and development, subdividers shall grant, reserve and set aside
easements in streets and roads for installation and maintenance of
sewer lines at such time that the subdivision or land development
shall be a part of the Township sanitary sewer system.
(4) A sewer shall be considered to be planned for extension to a given
area any time after preliminary engineering and related studies
have been completed and the construction of facilities adequate to
serve the area containing the subdivision has been programmed for
completion within a reasonable time.
(5) When capped sewers are provided, on-site disposal facilities shall
also be provided.

developments, whether utilizing public or private streets or
driveways serving as private streets, and, in the case of a
subdivision or land development utilizing private streets, the
subdivider or the applicant shall execute recordable covenants with
the Township and/or Township authority that, for the purposes of
sewer connections, assessments and rentals, the rights and
liabilities of himself and his grantees, heirs, successors and assigns
shall be the same as if his property abutted a public street.
(10) The specifications for the installation of a sanitary sewer and
appurtenances required by this chapter shall be those set forth in
Chapter 162, Sewers, Article III, Sewer Connection Regulations,
§ 162-31B(4), Materials and installation.
B. On-lot disposal system. If public sewage disposal is not available and
the sewage treatment is on a project or individual-lot basis, such private
facilities must be installed by the subdivider, developer or builder under
the direct supervision of the Sewage Enforcement Officer, the
Department of Environmental Resources or other appropriate official.
(1) Necessary tests and inspections. Such officer shall require
percolation tests, soil samples and other data to determine the size
and extent of facilities needed. During installation of such facilities,
and before final coverage, the State Health Officer or other

Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Flood Boundary -
Floodway Map shall be available in the East Norriton Township Office
for inspection. In regard to the adopted Floodplain Conservation
District, the regulations contained herein shall apply to those areas
defined and established as flood-prone.
B. The regulations contained herein are intended to conform to the
requirements of Section 1910.3d of the National Flood Insurance
Program, P.L. 93-234. Furthermore, it is the purpose of these
regulations to:
(1) Regulate the subdivision and development of flood-prone land
areas in order to promote the general health, welfare and safety of
the community.
(2) Require that each subdivision lot or development site in floodprone
areas be provided with a safe building site with adequate
access and that public facilities which serve such sites be designed
and installed to preclude flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
(3) Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for use
because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision and
development of unprotected flood-prone areas.

openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows without unduly
increasing flood heights.
G. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of surface
waters without risk to persons or property. The drainage system shall
ensure drainage at all points along streets and ensure conveyance of
drainage away from buildings. The Township Supervisors may require
an underground system to accommodate a one-hundred-year flood and
a secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less frequent
floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and regional
drainage plans. The facilities shall be designed to prevent the discharge
of excess runoff onto adjacent properties.
H. All new or replacement sanitary sewer systems, whether public or
private, located in flood-prone areas shall be floodproofed up to a point
1 1/2 feet above the base flood elevation.
I. All new or replacement water systems, whether public or private, in

floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
(2) A waiver shall only be issued if there is:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(b) A determination that failure to relax the requirements would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(c) A determination that the relaxing of a requirement will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety or extraordinary public expense; create nuisances;
cause fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
(3) A waiver shall only be issued upon a determination that the waiver
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.

create interior spaces and courtyards shall be incorporated
whenever feasible.
(4) Orientation. Mobile homes are encouraged to be arranged in a
variety of orientations and are strongly encouraged to have many
units with their long sides facing the street rather than their ends,
in order to provide variety and interest. Site layout shall be
designed to ensure that mobile home units are offset to block long
uninterrupted vistas between the units.
B. Common open space. In addition to the requirements of the East
Norriton Township Zoning Ordinance,156 the following regulations shall
also apply:
(1) Arrangement. The common space shall be designed as a contiguous
area unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
East Norriton Township Board of Supervisors that two or more
separate areas would be preferable. The open space shall also have
easily identifiable pedestrian and visual accessibility to all
residents of the mobile home development, although all units do
not have to abut the common open space.
C. Buffers.
(1) General requirements. Along all exterior property boundary lines
except those which abut another mobile home development, there
156. Editor's Note: See Ch. 205, Zoning.
§ 175-49 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-49
163:544
shall be a permanent buffer at least 10 feet in depth, unless this
is waived pursuant to Subsection C(4) below. A screen buffer (as
defined herein) shall be provided wherever the mobile home
development abuts existing residential uses, with the exception
of high-rise structures, and where abutting other types of uses
when deemed necessary by the East Norriton Township Board
of Supervisors to provide sufficient buffering and transition. A
softening buffer (as defined herein) shall be provided wherever
the mobile home development abuts existing high-rise residential
uses, existing commercial, office, industrial and institutional uses;
any existing street [as modified by Subsection C(3) below], drive
or parking area; or open (not wooded) undeveloped land. An open
buffer shall be provided wherever the mobile home development
abuts wooded, undeveloped land or where more extensive buffers
are deemed unnecessary by the East Norriton Township Board of
Supervisors.
(2) Components. The minimum component of each type of buffer shall
be as follows:
(a) Screen buffer. The primary components of a screen buffer shall
be a row of evergreen trees, at a height of not less than six feet
when planted, spaced not more than 10 feet apart on center,
and these trees shall be of such species to attain a height of
maturity of not less than 20 feet. Also required as a secondary
component of the buffer is one of the following: mounding (the
use of which is encouraged), provided that the slopes shall be a
maximum of three-to-one, visually opaque fencing not greater
than six feet in height and coniferous shrubbery. Any
combination of evergreen trees, coniferous shrubs, mounding,
fencing or other natural vegetation or man-made materials is
allowable, provided that an effective visual screen at least 15
feet in height above the adjacent ground elevation in the
mobile home development is achieved within a reasonable
time. But whenever only vegetation is used, there shall be at
least a double row of evergreen trees, with the trees in one row
offset five feet from the trees in the other row and the rows at
least five feet apart.
(b) Softening buffer. The primary component of a softening buffer
shall be a row of trees, spaced not more than 25 feet apart on
center, at least 25% of which shall be evergreens. The
evergreen trees shall be at least six feet in height when planted
and shall attain at least 20 feet in height at maturity. Any
deciduous trees shall be at least 1 1/2 inches in caliper and
eight feet in height when planted and shall attain a height of
not less than 20 feet at maturity. These trees shall be
interspersed with other allowable components, including any
other type of trees, shrubs, mounding, fencing and/or similar
§ 175-49 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-49
163:545
§ 175-50. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ANCHORING  The fastening of the mobile home to its mobile home stand
in order to prevent upset or damage due to wind, erosion, flooding or other
natural forces.
HITCH  A device which is part of the frame or attaches to the frame
of a mobile home and connects it to a power source for the purpose of
transporting the unit.

natural or man-made elements having a visible vertical
dimension, or any combination thereof.
(c) Open buffer. The open buffer shall, as a minimum, consist of
grass, ground cover and/or similar vegetative material and
may include trees, shrubs or other natural or man-made
landscaping materials, but it shall be mostly vegetative with
minimal paved areas, if any.
(3) Street boundaries. Rather than the extensive buffers described in
Subsection C(2) above, the use of a single row of deciduous trees at
least eight feet in height when planted and at least 20 feet in height
at maturity, with a spacing of not more than 40 feet on center, may
be provided along all property boundaries which abut a street,
wherever necessary for adequate sight distance or where the East
Norriton Township Board of Supervisors determines this to be a
sufficient buffer to protect the welfare and safety of the community.
(4) Existing buffers. In cases where an edge(s) of a development
occurs along natural features which function as buffers, including
but not limited to mature vegetation, significant grade changes or
stream valleys, which are likely to be permanently preserved,
buffering may be waived along that edge(s) upon approval of the
East Norriton Township Board of Supervisors.
(5) Maintenance. All vegetation shall be maintained permanently and,
in the event of death or other destruction, shall be replaced within
one year by the persons responsible for maintenance when death or
destruction occurred.
(6) Buffer landscape plan. A landscaping plan shall be submitted with
the final plans, showing all pertinent information, including the
location, size and species of all individual trees and shrubs to be
preserved or planted or, alternately, the general characteristics of
existing vegetation masses which are to be preserved.

ARTICLE VIII
Fees; Conditions of Acceptance; Approval
§ 175-51. Fees.
A. The owner shall pay to the Township reasonable and necessary
engineering fees incurred by the Township for the services of the
Township Engineer and/or the Township Engineer's staff incidental to
the review, examination and inspection of lands, plans and of the
construction of improvements and such other necessary reviews,
examinations and inspections. Inspection by the Township Engineer's
office may be required on a full-time basis during all periods when
construction on the required improvements is taking place. By way of
example and not of limitation, the owner shall pay to the Township all
costs for testing concrete materials used in the construction of required
improvements, including but not limited to concrete curb and concrete
sidewalk.
(1) The tests shall be made for each day's pour or 50 cubic yards of
concrete pour, whichever occurs first. Each series of tests will
include:
(a) Slump test.
(b) Air meter tests for air entrainment.
(c) Four test cylinders [two cylinders for seven-day strength test;
two cylinders for twenty-eight-day strength test].
(2) The owner shall also pay to the Township reasonable legal fees
incurred by the Township for legal services incidental to the review
and approval of plans for each subdivision or land development or
section thereof, including but not limited to the drafting and review
of the development agreements, the escrow agreements and any
other documents required by this chapter. These costs for
engineering and legal services shall also include any services
incidental to the final acceptance by the Township all or any portion
of the required improvements, as well as all costs of inspections by
Township employees not otherwise covered by permit fees.
(3) The review fees of East Norriton Township's professional
consultants, including but not limited to its solicitor and engineer,
shall be based upon a schedule established and revised from time
to time by ordinance or resolution.
(4) In the event that the owner disputes the amount of any such review
fees, the owner shall, within 10 days of the billing date, notify the
Township that such fees are disputed in which case the Township
shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development
application due to the owner's request over disputed fees.
§ 175-51 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-51
163:547
(5) In the event that the Township and the owner cannot agree on the
amount of review fees which are reasonable and necessary, then
the owner and the Township shall follow the procedure for dispute
resolution set forth in § 175-53.1D.
B. The engineering, legal fees and other fees required to be paid by this
article shall be promptly paid to the Township by the owner upon the
submission of bills thereof to the owner by the Township from time to
time, as such fees are billed to the Township by its Engineer or Solicitor
or as determined by the Township in the case of Township employees.
Failure to promptly pay any such fee shall result in revocation of the
building permit.
C. To the engineering and legal fees required to be paid to the Township by
this article, there shall be added the sum of 5%, which the owner shall
pay to the Township as reimbursement to the Township of the costs
incurred by the Township for the collection of such fees and the
disbursement of the same to the Township Engineer and Township
Solicitor.
D. At the time of submission of preliminary plans, the applicant or
developer shall deposit a cash escrow with the Township to cover costs,
fees and expenses (for purposes of this section, "review fees"),
including but not limited to engineering and legal fees incurred during
the review and approval process of subdivision and land development
plans and through the final completion of the subdivision or land
development and expiration of the improvements' maintenance period.
The amount of such escrow shall be as set forth and established by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors and as amended from time to
time. Failure to post the cash escrow at the time of application for
preliminary plan review shall result in rejection of the application as
being incomplete. The Township may draw upon the cash escrow as
necessary to reimburse itself for review fees of the Township related to
the review and approval of subdivision or land development plans. A
copy of the invoice for review fees shall be sent by the Township to the
applicant/developer, and such invoice shall be paid by the Township
from the cash escrow unless the applicant disputes the amount of the
review fees and notifies the Township of such dispute within 10 days of
the billing date. In case of a dispute over review fees, the precision set
forth in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code157 shall be
applied. Upon each draw on the cash escrow by the Township, the
Township shall send the developer an invoice marked "Paid" for the
amount drawn, specifying the particular review fee for which the
Township has drawn payment or reimbursement. Within 10 days of the
developer's receipt of notice from the Township that the balance of the
escrow required by this section is inadequate to cover the reasonable
costs and expenses likely to be incurred by the Township in review and
approval of the land development or subdivision plans, the developer

163:548
§ 175-52. Conditions of acceptance; guaranty.
§ 175-53. Requirements prior to approval.
shall post such additional moneys as have been specified in the notice,
subject to dispute resolution set forth in § 175-53.1D. In the event that
the developer or applicant shall fail to make payment within 10 days of
receipt of notice from the Township and that such failure shall result
in insufficient funds in escrow to pay any bill for engineering, legal or
other services related to the review and approval procedure within 30
days of its due date, whether before or after the final approval of the
subdivision or land development, interest shall be added to the bill of
the applicant/developer at the rate of 1 1/2% per month until paid.
A. Conditions. The Township shall have no obligation to take over and
make public any street or other improvement unless:
(1) The required improvements, utility mains and laterals and
monuments shown on an approved plan or plans have been
constructed to all requirements of this chapter.
(2) It is established to the satisfaction of the governing body that there
is need for the improvements to be taken over and made public.
B. Acceptance. The Township shall have no responsibility with respect to
any street or other improvement, notwithstanding the use of the same
by the public, unless the street or other improvement is accepted by
ordinance or resolution of the governing body.
C. Guaranty. The applicants will guarantee, for a period of 18 months from
the date of the resolution accepting dedication, to maintain the stability
of all materials and work, to promptly make good and replace all poor
or inferior materials and work and to remedy all defects in materials or
workmanship, all shrinkage, settlement or other faults of any kind
whatsoever arising therefrom necessary for the structural integrity of
said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plan at his own expense and to the satisfaction of the Township
Engineer, when notified in writing to do so by the Township Engineer;
and, in order to secure the guaranty as herein required, the Township
shall be assured by means of a proper financial security not exceeding
15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements to be posted
by the owner with the Township.
A. Financial security.
(1) No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such
plan have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition or improved as may be required by this
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, and any walkways,
curbs, gutters, streetlights, traffic signals, traffic control signs, fire
§ 175-51 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-53
163:549
hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers
and other improvements as may be required by this Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance have been installed in
accordance with this article. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements or fees required as a condition for the final approval
of a plan, the subdivider or developer may provide for the deposit
with the Township of financial security in an amount sufficient
to cover the costs of such improvements or common amenities,
including but not limited to roads, stormwater detention and/or
retention basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational
facilities, open space improvements or buffer or screen plantings
which may be required.
(2) When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing,
the Board of Supervisors shall furnish the developer with a signed
copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent
upon the developer obtaining satisfactory financial security. The
final plat or record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the
financial improvements agreement (in form and substance
satisfactory to the Township Solicitor) is executed. The resolution
or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be
revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within
90 days of the date of the resolution of contingent approval unless a
written extension is granted by the Board of Supervisors; such
extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in
writing at the request of the developer.
(3) Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, federal or commonwealth chartered
lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or
escrow accounts in such lending institutions shall be deemed
acceptable financial security for the purposes of this section.
(4) Such financial security shall be posted with a federal or
commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided that said lending institution
is authorized to conduct such business within the commonwealth.
[Amended 10-27-2015 by Ord. No. 567]
(5) Such guaranty shall provide for and secure to the public the
completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or
accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements.
[Amended 10-27-2015 by Ord. No. 567]
(6) The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually the Township may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost
§ 175-53 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-53
163:550
for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
said adjustment, the Township may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this subsection.
(7) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
Township Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good
cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the Township are
unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer
licensed as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the
Township and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by
the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall
be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally
by the Township and the applicant or developer.
(8) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an
amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
(9) In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Township may authorize submission of final plans by section or
stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees
as to improvements in future sections or stages of development as
it finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section
of the development.
(10) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the release, from time to time,
of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to
the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such
requests shall be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors,
and the Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of
such request within which to allow the Township Engineer to
certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such portion of
the work upon the improvements has been completed in
§ 175-53 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-53
163:551
accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification, the
Board of Supervisors shall authorize release by the lending
institution of an amount as estimated by the Township Engineer
fairly representing the value of the improvements completed or,
if the Board of Supervisors fails to act within said forty-five-day
period, the Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to have approved
the release of funds as requested. The Board of Supervisors may,
prior to final release at the time of completion and certification
by its Engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of
the aforesaid improvements. [Amended 10-27-2015 by Ord. No.
567]
(11) If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public
utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the
Township, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the
regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise
required by this section.
(12) If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a
plat as set forth in this section, the Township shall not condition the
issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the
erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon
the lots or land as depicted upon the approved final plan. If
financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for any
building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following:
the improvement of the streets providing access to and from
existing public roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free or
otherwise permanently passable condition, as well as the
completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the
approved plan, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in
question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable
use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
(13)No plan shall be finally approved until the applicant or developer
shall have deposited a cash escrow with the Township to be drawn
upon by the Township to reimburse the Township for fees, costs and
expenses which the Township may incur in connection with the
applicant's or developer's subdivision or land development. The
amount to be deposited in escrow with the Township shall be 10%
of the total construction cost of the required improvements as
determined in § 175-53A(7) or elsewhere in the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance unless, in the judgment of the
Township Engineer, a greater or lesser amount is necessary to
secure the payment of the expenses which the Township is likely to
incur in connection with the subdivision or land development. Upon
§ 175-53 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-53
163:552
each withdrawal from the escrow by the Township, the Township
shall send the developer or applicant an invoice marked "Paid" for
the amount drawn, specifying the particular fee, cost or expense
for which the Township has drawn payment or reimbursement.
Within 10 days of the developer's receipt of notice from the
Township that the balance of the escrow required by this section
is inadequate to cover the reasonable costs and expenses likely to
be incurred by the Township with regard to the subdivision or land
development, the developer or applicant shall post such additional
moneys as have been specified in the notice, subject to dispute
resolution set forth in § 175-53.1D. In the event that the developer
or applicant shall fail to make such payment within 10 days of
receipt of notice from the Township and that such failure shall
result in insufficient funds in escrow to pay any bill for engineering,
legal or other services related to the land development or
subdivision within 30 days of its due date, interest shall be added to
the bill of the applicant/developer at the rate of 1 1/2% per month
until paid.
B. The subdivider or developer shall carry out the construction and
installation of street improvements, to include grading the full width of
right-of-way to the specified cross section, including the side slopes,
sanitary sewers, storm drains, water and gas mains, curb, sidewalks,
fire hydrants, streetlights, street name signs, shade trees, paving the
cartway in strict accordance with the approved improvement
construction plans with strict adherence to the standards and
specifications of the Township and the erection of approved barricades
when streets terminate temporarily at property boundary lines.
C. Forty-eight hours prior to the commencement of any operation in the
construction or installation of streets, curbs, sidewalks, drainage of
streets, curbs, sidewalks, drainage facilities, water and sewer facilities,
street signs, monuments or capped sewers, the owner shall notify the
Township Engineer who shall inspect the work, materials, construction
and installations as to Township requirements. No work requiring a
permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation shall be
started until such permit has been received by the Township. Fortyeight
hours prior to the commencement of any operations within the
existing public right-of-way, notice shall be given to the East Norriton
Township Police Department.
D. The Township Engineer shall be authorized to have such tests of
materials made as he deems proper in order to have proper control of
materials. The owner shall pay to the Township the cost of such tests
plus 5% to reimburse the Township for the collection of such fees and
disbursements of the same to Township Engineer.
E. All required improvements shall be completed within one year from the
date of final plan approval except as otherwise provided for pursuant to
the terms of the Municipalities Planning Code. The date of
commencement of construction shall be determined to be the date upon
§ 175-53 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-53
163:553
§ 175-53.1. Inspection; payment of expenses.
which a building permit has been granted. In no event shall a building
permit be granted after the expiration of one year from the date of final
approval under this chapter without a resubmission by the subdivider
or developer to the Township Engineer for a determination of any
increase in the estimated cost of completion of required improvements.
Provided that the Township is satisfied that sufficient escrow remains,
extensions to complete the construction of public improvements shall
be automatically granted until such time as the Township shall
determine that the subdivision has been substantially completed. At
that time, the Township shall provide to the owner a written notice
that the public improvements must be completed within six months of
the date of that notice. If the public improvements are not completed
as provided therein, the Township shall be entitled to all remedies
pursuant to this chapter and the land development agreement.
F. Premises identification. Prior to the issuance of any use and occupancy
permit for any new building, street signs identifying the names of any
streets on which the property exists and all streets leading thereto shall
be installed. Further, premises identification signs as required by
Section 623.0 of the East Norriton Township BOCA Building Code
(1984), as amended, shall be installed on the property.
G. No construction of buildings or work involved in the construction or
installation of public or other improvements shall be done before 6:00
a.m. or after 8:00 p.m.
H. The owner shall be responsible to prevent the accumulation of debris or
mud on existing Township roads. The owner shall follow the directions
of the Township to prevent such an accumulation, and, in the event that
any accumulation occurs, such accumulation shall be removed promptly
upon direction of the Township. Failure to promptly remove any such
accumulation shall entitle the Township, through its own forces or
through subcontractors, to remove the debris and bill the owner for the
work.
A. When the developer has completed all of the necessary, appropriate and
required improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of
Supervisors, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof
to the Township Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall, within 10
days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Township
Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Township
Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing, with the Board of
Supervisors, and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the
developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and
mailed within 30 days after receipt by the Township Engineer of the
authorization from the Board of Supervisors; the report shall be
detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of the improvements,
either in whole or in part, and if the improvements, or any portion
§ 175-53 EAST NORRITON CODE § 175-53.1
163:554
thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Township
Engineer, the Engineer's report shall contain a statement of reasons for
such nonapproval or rejection.
B. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered
mail, of the action of the Board of Supervisors with relation thereto.
C. If any portion of the required improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall
proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
D. The developer shall reimburse the Township for the reasonable and
necessary expense incurred for the inspection of improvements. Such
reimbursement shall be based upon a schedule established by
ordinance or resolution. Such expense shall be reasonable and in
accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the
Township Engineer or consultant for work performed for similar
services in the community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate
or cost charged by the Engineer or consultant to the Township when
fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on developers.
(1) In the event that the developer disputes the amount of any such
expense in connection with the inspection of improvements, the
developer shall, within 10 working days of the date of billing, notify
the Township that such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or
unnecessary, in which case the Township shall not delay or
disapprove a subdivision or land development application or any
approval or permit related to development due to the developer's
request over disputed expenses.
(2) If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the Township and the
developer cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the developer and Township shall
jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another professional
engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
review said expenses and make a determination as to the amount
thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
(3) The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence
and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his
or her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within
50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay
the entire amount determined in the decision immediately.
(4) In the event that the Township and developer cannot agree upon
the professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the
billing date, then upon application of either party, the President
Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (or if at
the time there shall be no President Judge, then the senior active
judge then sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case,
§ 175-53.1 SHOPPING CARTS § 175-53.1
163:555
shall be neither the Township Engineer nor any professional
engineer who has been retained by or performed services for the
Township or the developer within the preceding five years.
(5) The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the developer
if the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in

A. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be
subject to pay for and in respect to the transaction or any part thereof a
tax at the rate of 1% of the value of the real estate represented by such
document, which tax shall be payable at the earliest of the time the
document is presented for recording or within 30 days of acceptance of
such document or within 30 days of becoming an acquired company.

affixing of an official stamp or writing by the Recorder of Deeds
whereon the date of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the
signature of the collecting agent shall be set forth.
C. It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer, then the tax levied by the Township of East Norriton under the
authority of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and
such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
East Norriton Township; provided, however, that the Township of East
Norriton and any other political subdivision which impose such tax on
the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. Any realty transfer tax, or a portion thereof, imposed by East Norriton
Township which is not paid by the date the tax is due shall bear interest
at a rate as prescribed for interest on delinquent municipal claims

Reform Code of 1971, known as the "Realty Transfer Tax," and other
provisions authorizing the Department of Revenue and the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to determine, collect and enforce the
tax, interest and penalties. The interest rate shall be the lesser of the
interest rate imposed upon delinquent commonwealth taxes as
provided in Section 806 of the Act of April 9, 1929 (P.L. 343, No. 176)(72
P.S. § 806), as amended, known as "The Fiscal Code," or the maximum

§ 182-56. Exemptions.
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall
not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.
§ 182-57. Excluded transactions.
A. The tax imposed by § 182-55 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation, which reconveyance may include property fine
adjustments, provided that said reconveyance is made within one
year from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which the Township of East Norriton is prohibited from
taxing under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, Township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, Township, school
district or county of a tax-delinquent property at Sheriffs sale or
Tax Claim Bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife; between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce; between parent
and child or the spouse of such child; between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister; and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are

granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.

beneficiary of an ordinary trust.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from trustee to
successor trustee.
(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party or from or to an agent or straw party

be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this subsection.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the Department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.

record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the

corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.

Snow and Ice Emergencies
[Amended 10-27-2015 by Ord. No. 565]
§ 196-34. Declaration of snow and ice emergency.
In order to facilitate the movement of traffic and to combat the hazards
of snow and ice, the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, or his or her
designee, in his or her discretion, may declare a snow and ice emergency
(designated in this article as a "snow emergency"). Information on the
existence of a snow emergency may be given by the Township through
radio, newspaper or other available media, and information on the
termination of the emergency may be given by use of the same media.
§ 196-35. Parking restrictions.
After any snow emergency is declared, it shall be unlawful, at any time
during the continuance of the emergency, for any person to park a motor
vehicle or to allow that vehicle to remain parked on any street or road
within the Township until the snow has been completely plowed for the full
width of the cartway.
§ 196-36. (Reserved)
§ 196-37. Penalty for violation.
A. If, at any time during a period of snow emergency declared under
§ 196-34 of this article, a person, corporation, or other entity shall park
a motor vehicle or allow a motor vehicle to remain parked, stalled, or
incapable of moving anywhere upon any street or road in the Township,
that person shall be guilty of a violation of this article and, upon
conviction, shall be fined not more than $600 plus costs of prosecution,
after a summary proceeding brought in the name of the Township
before a District Justice. A new and separate offense shall be deemed to
be committed for each day that such violation exists. In default of the
payment of any fine imposed and the costs, the person or persons that
are charged may be sentenced to be committed to the county jail for a
period not exceeding 30 days.
B. In all cases where a police officer of East Norriton Township shall first
give notice of the offense by either handing to the offending operator or
affixing to the motor vehicle in question a ticket on which he has noted
the time and place of the offense, nature of the offense charged and the
license registration of the motor vehicle in question, no prosecution
shall be instituted for 72 hours thereafter, provided that, if, during said
seventy-two-hour period, the offender shall voluntarily appear at the
office of the Township Secretary of East Norriton Township during
regular business hours and voluntarily enter a plea of guilty and pay a
fine of $30 to the Township, no prosecution for such offense shall
thereafter be brought.

ARTICLE XVII
Floodplain Conservation District
[Added 2-23-2016 by Ord. No. 569218]
§ 205-91. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,219 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Pursuant to that obligation, the following regulations are enacted.
§ 205-92. General provisions.
A. Intent. The intent of this article is to:
(1) Protect areas of the floodplain necessary to contain floodwaters.
(2) To permit only those uses in the floodplain that are compatible with
preserving natural conditions and stream flow.
(3) Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community
by preventing development in areas prone to flooding.
(4) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(5) Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
(6) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents by preventing excessive
development in areas subject to flooding.
(7) Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
B. Applicability.
(1) The Floodplain Conservation District is defined and established as
a district applicable to those areas of East Norriton Township
subject to inundation by the waters of the one-percent annual
chance flood as delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, as prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated March 2, 2016,
and subsequent revisions thereto. Said floodplain areas shall
consist of the following specific areas:
218. Editors Note: This ordinance also repealed former Art. XVII, Floodplain Conservation
District, as amended.
219. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
§ 205-91 TOWING § 205-92
186:807
(a) Those areas established as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs)
according to FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for
East Norriton Township. Areas constituting SFHAs include the
following:
[1] Zone A: areas subject to inundation by the one-percent
annual chance flood event generally determined using
approximate methodologies. Because detailed hydraulic
analyses have not been performed, no base flood
elevations (BFEs) or flood depths are known. Mandatory
flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain
management standards apply.
[2] Zone AE: areas subject to inundation by the one-percent
annual chance flood event determined by detailed
methods. BFEs are shown. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements and floodplain management
standards apply.
(b) Soils with a frequency of flooding of 1% or greater per year, as
delineated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service,
United States Department of Agriculture Web-Based Soil
Survey (available online at
http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/), including the following
soils:
[1] Bowmansville (Bo).
[2] Knauers (Bo).
[3] Gibraltar (Gc).
[4] Hatboro (Ha).
[5] Rowland (Rt).
[6] Rowland (RwA).
[7] Rowland (RwB).
[8] Urban land occasionally flooded (UlA).
(2) In lieu of the above, East Norriton Township may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, licensed in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Township.
§ 205-92 EAST NORRITON CODE § 205-92
186:808
§ 205-93. Definitions; word usage.
(3) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be delineated according
to FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for East Norriton
Township, which is hereby made a part of this article, and
additional area based on soils as described in § 205-92B(1)(b). The
FIRM is available for inspection at the municipal office.
(4) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be deemed an overlay on
any zoning district now or hereafter applicable to any lot.
(5) It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any
construction or development anywhere within East Norriton
Township unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain
Administrator.
(6) A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing
buildings or structures.
C. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any other
conflicting provisions which may be in effect in the Floodplain
Conservation District. However, any other ordinance provisions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this article, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
D. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this article shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
this article, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this
purpose the provisions of this article are hereby declared to be
severable.
E. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the Floodplain
Conservation District or that land uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages.
(2) This article shall not create liability on the part of East Norriton
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this article or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing
the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any point.
(a) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection regional office.
(2) The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which
base flood elevations have been provided.
(a) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(b) The AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by
FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided but
no floodway has been determined.
[1] No permit shall be granted for any construction,
development, use, or activity within any AE Area/District
without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
§ 205-94 EAST NORRITON CODE § 205-94
186:816
together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any
point.
[2] No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection regional office.
(3) A Area/District.
(a) The A Area/District shall be the areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no one-percent annual chance flood elevations have
been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the elevation shall be determined
by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
Floodplain Conservation District which is nearest the
construction site.
(b) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant
to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by professional engineers licensed in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
municipality.
(4) The Shallow Flooding Area/District shall be those areas identified
as Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are
subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow
flooding where average depths are between one and three feet. In
Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
(5) Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas
where East Norriton Township has identified local flood hazard or
ponding areas, as delineated and adopted on a Local Flood Hazard
Map using the best available topographic data and locally derived
information such as flood of record, historic high water marks, soils
or appropriate study methodologies.
C. Changes in identification of area. The Floodplain Conservation District
may be revised or modified by the East Norriton Board of Supervisors
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such

as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
D. Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
East Norriton Township Planning Commission, and any party aggrieved
by this decision or determination may appeal to the East Norriton
Township Board of Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant.
E. Corporate boundary changes. Prior to development occurring in areas
where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are proposed
or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data
affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The community shall
adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to annexation
or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR
60.3.

shall consider, at a minimum, the following:
(a) That there is good and sufficient cause, including:
[1] That there are unique physical circumstances or
conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is
due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of the
zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located.
[2] That because of such physical circumstances or
conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be
developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the
zoning ordinance and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
[3] That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by
the appellant.
[4] That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
(b) That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.
(c) That the granting of the variance will:
[1] Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense; nor
[2] Create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the public,
or conflict with any other applicable state or local
ordinances and regulations.
(5) A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall
be maintained by East Norriton Township. In addition, a report of
all variances granted during the year shall be included in the

municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have
been first obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
(b) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall
be made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the
activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
(c) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of
Community and Economic Development shall be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
(2) The municipality shall require technical or scientific data to be
submitted to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR) within six
months of the completion of any new construction, development, or
other activity resulting in changes in the BFE. A LOMR or
conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is required for:
(a) Any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations
within the floodway; or
(b) Any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone AE

may be extended upon the lot occupied by such building and held in
single and separate ownership on the effective date of this chapter,

effective date of this chapter, and, in those cases, the nonconformity
shall be determined as of the date the use first became nonconforming;
in excess of the 50% allowed by the preceding subsection up to a
maximum of 100% increase in floor area by special exception granted
by the Zoning Hearing Board. Any such special exception shall provide
that any structural alteration, extension or addition shall conform to all
the height, area, width, yard and coverage requirements for the district
in which it is located.

(6) Subject to legal restraints, for determining whether some or all of
the mediation sessions shall be open or closed to the public.

186:870
C. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including but not
limited to the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act on the
application therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist order or the
registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or
lot.
D. Appeals from a determination by a municipal engineer or the Zoning
Officer with reference to the administration of any floodplain or flood
hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance.
E. Applications for variance from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance and
Flood Hazard Ordinance or such provisions within a land use
ordinance.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of the zoning ordinances inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the
form of application and may require preliminary application to the
Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of
the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance
and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary
to enable the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(2) In granting any variance the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
§ 205-142 TOWING § 205-142
186:871
the purposes of the Municipalities Planning Code233 and the Zoning
Ordinance.
F. Applications for special exceptions under the Zoning Ordinance or
Floodplain or Flood Hazard Ordinance or such provisions within a land
use ordinance.
(1) The Board shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions, in
accordance with the following standards and criteria:
(a) The suitability for the property for the use desired.
(b) The effect of the proposed use upon the safety and health of the
immediate neighborhood and the general public therein.
(c) The effect of the proposed use upon the character of the
immediate neighborhood so as to conserve the value of existing
buildings and encourage the most appropriate use of the land.
(2) In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance. The Board is charged with
using its most sound discretion in considering special exceptions in
that the uses subject to the special exceptions have not been
permitted in a given district but rather must be considered on a
case-by-case basis. The burden of proof in any application for a
special exception shall be on the applicant to prove that the use is
one which is permitted by special exception and that the proposed
use will not adversely affect the general public.234
G. Appeals from the determination of any officer or agency charged with
the administration of any transfers of development rights or
performance density provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
H. Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination pursuant to a request
for a preliminary opinion.
I. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or municipal
engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or provisions
thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and
stormwater management insofar as the same do not relate to
application for subdivision or land development under the Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance or the Planned Residential
Development Ordinance, if any.
J. A variance or special exception shall lapse one year after the date of its
grant unless a building permit has been obtained to affect such
233. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.

exception shall lapse one year after the date on which the subdivision or

Supervisors unless a building permit has been obtained to affect such

§ 205-181. Variance.
Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance with
14 CFR Part 77 Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-1 as amended or replaced).
Determinations of whether to grant a variance will depend on the
determinations made by the FAA and the Department's BOA as to the effect
of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe,
efficient use of navigable air space. In particular, the request for a variance
shall consider which of the following categories the FAA has placed the
proposed construction in:
§ 205-182. Use restrictions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use shall be made
of land or water within the Airport District Overlay in such a manner
as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, impair visibility in the
Department's BOA response must be included with this permit
application for it to be considered complete. If the Department's BOA
returns a determination of no penetration of airspace, the permit
request should be considered in compliance with the intent of this
overlay article. If the Department's BOA returns a determination of a
penetration of airspace, the permit shall be denied, and the project
sponsor may seek a variance from such regulations as outlined in
§ 205-181.
B. No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace
parts of existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height
of an existing structure.
A. No objection. The subject construction is determined not to exceed
obstruction standards, and marking/lighting is not required to mitigate
potential hazard. Under this determination a variance shall be granted.
B. Conditional determination. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport hazard
area which can be effectively mitigated. Under this determination, a
variance shall be granted contingent upon implementation of mitigating
measures as described in § 205-184, Obstruction marking and lighting.
C. Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined to
be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be denied and
the reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the applicant.
Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that
a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the
public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this
article.

vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the
airport.
§ 205-183. Preexisting nonconforming uses.
The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or
tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this
article, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use.
No nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to grow
higher, so as to increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming use, once
substantially abated (subject to the underlying zoning ordinance,) may only
be reestablished consistent with the provisions herein.
§ 205-184. Obstruction marking and lighting.
Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this article
may be conditioned according to the process described in § 205-181 to
require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question
to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person
requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate, and maintain such
marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure both ground and air
safety.
§ 205-185. Violations and penalties.
Violations of this article shall be subject to that in the underlying Zoning
Ordinance.
§ 205-186. Appeals.
Appeals shall be subject to the process in the underlying Zoning Ordinance.

reviewed and approved by the Township.
(6) Relocation or removal of facilities. Within 60 days following written
notice from the Township, or such longer period as the Township
determines is reasonably necessary, or such shorter period in the
case of an emergency, an owner of a WCF in the ROW shall, at its
own expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change
or alter the position of any WCF when the Township, consistent
with its police powers and applicable Public Utility Commission
regulations, shall have determined that such removal, relocation,
change or alteration is reasonably necessary under the following
circumstances:
(a) The construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any
Township or other public improvement in the right-of-way;
(b) The operations of the Township or other governmental entity in
the right-of-way;
(c) Vacation of a street or road or the release of a utility easement;
or
(d) An emergency as determined by the Township.
(7) Visual or land use impact. The Township retains the right to deny
an application for the construction or placement of a non-tower
WCF based upon visual and/or land use impact.
A. Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this article shall be
subject, upon finding by a Magisterial District Judge, to a penalty not
exceeding $500, for each and every offense, together with attorneys'
fees and costs. A separate and distinct violation shall be deemed to be
committed each day on which a violation occurs or continues to occur.
In addition to an action to enforce any penalty imposed by this article
and any other remedy at law or in equity, the Township may apply to a
federal district court for an injunction or other appropriate relief at law
§ 205-194 EAST NORRITON CODE § 205-195
186:922
or in equity to enforce compliance with or restrain violation of any
provision of this article.
B. Determination of violation. In the event a determination is made that a
person has violated any provision of this article, such person shall be
provided written notice of the determination and the reasons therefor.
Except in the case of an emergency, the person shall have 30 days to
cure the violation. If the nature of the violation is such that it cannot be
fully cured within such time period, the Township may, in its reasonable
judgment, extend the time period to cure, provided the person has
commenced to cure and is diligently pursuing its efforts to cure. If the
violation has not been cured within the time allowed, the Township may
take any and all actions authorized by this article and/or federal and/or
Pennsylvania law and regulations.
