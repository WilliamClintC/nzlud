premises occupied by him or her.

offensive odors, and other animal activity, carried out on public and
private property. These activities are nuisances.
B. Nuisances of the foregoing type interfere with the normal use and
enjoyment of public and private property in the City and are
detrimental to the physical, mental, and social well-being of the people
as well as to their comfort, living conditions, general health, welfare
and safety and are therefore a public health and welfare hazard.
C. Regulations of such nuisances are necessary to protect the safety,
health and welfare of persons residing in, or visiting, the City.
D. The Third Class City Code (53 P.S. §§ 3414, 37701-A, now 11 Pa.C.S.A.

activities.
A. No person shall keep or harbor any dog, cat, bird or other animal in the
City so as to create offensive odors, excessive noise or unsanitary
conditions which are a menace to the health, comfort or safety of the
public, or otherwise permit the commission or existence of a nuisance
as defined herein.
B. It shall be illegal within the City of Lower Burrell for any person or
persons to own, possess, harbor, or control any animal or bird which
makes any noise continuously and/or incessantly outdoors for a period
of 10 minutes or makes such noise intermittently for 1/2 hour or more
to the disturbance of any person any time of the day or night regardless
of whether the animal or bird is physically situated in or upon private
property, said noise being a nuisance; provided that, at the time the
animal or bird is making such noise, no person is trespassing or

animal or bird is situated nor is there any legitimate cause which
justifiably provoked the animal or bird.
C. Any dog, cat or other animal which, by frequent and habitual barking,
howling, screeching, yelping, squawking or baying or in any way or
manner, disturbs or endangers the comfort, repose or health of persons
is hereby declared to be committing a nuisance. No owner or person
having the custody of such animal shall harbor or permit it to commit
such a nuisance.
D. Any dog, cat, bird or other animal which scratches, digs or defecates
upon the lawn, tree, shrub, plant, building or any other public or private
property, other than the property of the owner or person in charge or
control of such animal, is hereby declared to be a nuisance.
E. No person being the owner or in charge of or in control of any dog, cat,
bird, or other animal shall permit such animal to commit a nuisance on
any school grounds, City park or other public property, or upon private
property other than that of the owner or person in charge or in control
of such dog, cat, or other animal without the permission of the owner of
such property. Where the owner or person in charge or control of such
animal immediately removes all feces deposited by such animal and
disposes of same in a sanitary manner, such type of nuisance shall be
considered abated.
F. Owners shall not permit the occurrence of strong and offensive odors
from their animals on their property, which odors carry off of or beyond
their property, as this is a nuisance. This shall not apply to agricultural
operations, landscaping or home gardens.
A. This article shall not be deemed to prohibit or otherwise declare
unlawful any agricultural operations protected from nuisance suits by
Act No. 1982-133.
B. Persons with defective eyesight or hearing while relying upon a dog
specifically trained for these purposes shall be exempt from compliance
with this article. Owners who rely on service animals or birds and those
animals used for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) purposes are
also exempt.

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 170-17. Identification.
§ 170-18. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the City of Lower
Burrell, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated March 17, 2011 and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study.
B. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by City of Lower Burrell and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. Floodway area.
(1) Description.
(a) The area identified as Floodway in the FIS which represents
the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that
must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point.
(b) This term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood
heights shall be prohibited.
(b) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
B. Special floodplain area.
(1) Description. The areas identified as Zones AE and A1-30 in the FIS
which are subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods and have base flood
elevations (BFEs) shown.
§ 170-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-18
1:89
(2) Special requirements.
(a) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top of bank of
any watercourse, unless a permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
(b) In special floodplain areas without a designated floodway, no
new development shall be permitted unless it can be
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and
projected development will not increase the BFE by more than
one foot.
C. Approximate floodplain area.
(1) Description. The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS which are
subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood event
determined using approximate methodologies. Because detailed
hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no BFEs or flood
depths are shown.
(2) Special requirements.
(a) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top of bank of
any watercourse, unless a permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
(b) When available, information from other federal, state, and
other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the BFE,
as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the BFE shall be determined by using
a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which
is nearest the construction site in question.
(3) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the City of Lower Burrell.
D. Shallow flooding area.

1:90
§ 170-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Mayor
and Council where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify the FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 170-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the City of Lower Burrell Planning
Commission and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may
appeal to the Mayor and Council. The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant.

contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing
or securing the building or other structure, in which event the
Treasurer shall, if such estimate is deemed by the Treasurer to
be reasonable, return to the insured the amount of the funds
transferred to the City in excess of that required to pay the
municipal expenses; provided the City has not commenced to
remove, repair or secure the building or other structure, in
which case the City will complete the work.

reimbursement to the City general fund, the amount of the

(6) All construction shall be in accordance with the approved
specifications and inspected by the Authority's inspector before it is
covered up. Fee: see Subsection A.
(7) The installation of all gravity sewers and force mains (except
laterals) shall be tested in the field in the presence of the Authority
Engineer or his authorized assistant. Sewers shall be field tested
either pneumatically or hydrostatically for leakage. Each and every
section of sewer shall be tested.
(a) The pneumatic test shall be made by tightly capping all stubs
and Ys, plugging the ends and placing the section being tested
under air pressure. Air pressure is raised to four psig greater
than the average back pressure of any ground water. After a
two-minute air temperature stabilization time, test time starts.
Line pressure must not drop more than one psig in the time
allowed below:

(b) The hydrostatic or infiltration test is to be conducted following
installation of all manholes, service connections and collector
lines. Occurrence of rate of infiltration of groundwater in
excess of 50 gallons per inch diameter per mile of sewer per
day will be considered evidence of defective materials and/or
workmanship and shall require repair or replacement by the
contractor.

commonly referred to as the "Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act" (RCRA), and including State regulations contained in any state
sludge management plan prepared pursuant to Subtitle D of the
SWDA], the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, and the
Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.
Any building, structure, facility or installation from which there
is or may be a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which
commenced after the publication of proposed pretreatment
standards under § 307(c) of the Act which will be applicable to such
source if such standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance
with that section, provided that:
The building, structure, facility or installation is constructed at
a site at which no other source is located;

The building, structure, facility or installation totally replaces
the process or production equipment that causes the discharge
of pollutants at an existing source; or
(b)
The production of wastewater generating processes of the
building, structure, facility or installation are substantially
independent of an existing source at the same site. In
determining whether these are substantially independent,
factors such as the extent to which the new facility is
integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the
new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as
the existing source should be considered.

prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
(f) Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any
other product of the POTW such as residues, sludge, or scum,
to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with
the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance
discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in
noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines
or regulations developed under § 405 of the Act; any criteria,
guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal
developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean

biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in
pass through or interference, but in no case wastewater with a
temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds
40°C (104° F.), unless U.S. EPA has approved alternate limits as
requested by the POTW.
(j) Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD,
etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration
which a user knows or has reason to know will cause passthrough
or interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug
load have a flow rate or contain concentration or quantities of
pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15
minutes more than five times the average twenty-four-hour

(n) Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Municipal Authority of the City of New
Kensington.
(2) When the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington determines that a user is contributing to the POTW any
of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to cause
pass-through or interference of the POTW, the Control Authority
shall: advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the
POTW; and develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the
problem of pass-through or interference of the POTW. The
Authority may pursue an enforcement action, as outlined in
§ 238-28, Enforcement, of this article against the industrial user in
the event that the user causes pass-through or interference.
B. Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of
the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular
industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than
limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article.
The categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR, Chapter 1,
Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471, are incorporated herein by
reference. The control authority shall notify all affected users of the
applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
C. Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards.
(1) Where said POTW treatment plant achieves consistent removal of
pollutant(s) discharged by an industrial user to which a categorical
pretreatment standard(s) applies, the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington may, at its discretion and subject to
the conditions of 40 CFR 403.7, make application to the approval
authority for permission to grant removal credits to reflect removal
by the POTW of pollutants specified in the categorical pretreatment
standard(s). The control authority may grant a removal credit equal
to, or at its discretion, less than its consistent removal rate. Upon
being granted a removal credit, each affected industrial user shall
calculate its revised discharge limits in accordance with 40 CFR
403.7(a)(4).
(a) Consistent removal shall mean the average of the lowest 50%
of the removal measured according to 40 CFR 403.7(b)(2). All
sample data obtained for the measured pollutant during the
time period prescribed in 40 CFR 403.7(b)(2) must be reported
and used in computing consistent removal. If a substance is
measurable in the influent but not in the effluent, the effluent
level may be assumed to be the limit of measurement, and
those data may be used by the POTW at its discretion and
subject to approval by the approval authority. If the substance
is not measurable in the influent, the data may not be used.
§ 238-25 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-25
1:180
(b) The POTW may grant removal credits only if:
[1] The POTW applies for, and receives, authorization from the
approval authority to give a removal credit in accordance
with the requirements and procedures specified in 40 CFR
403.7(e);
[2] The POTW demonstrates and continues to achieve
consistent removal of all the pollutant(s) in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.7(b);
[3] The POTW has an approved pretreatment program in
accordance with and to the extent required by 40 CFR
403;
[4] The granting of removal credits will not cause the POTW to
violate the local, state, and federal sludge requirements
which apply to the sludge management method chosen by
the POTW; and
[5] The granting of removal credits will not cause a violation
of the POTW's permit limitation or conditions.
(2) The Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal
pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR
403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is
obtained.
D. Specific pollutant limitations. No person shall discharge wastewater
containing pollutants in excess of the maximum amounts specified in
then-current rules and regulations governing sewage services of the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington.
E. State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations on those in this article.
F. City of Lower Burrell's right of revision. The City of Lower Burrell
reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations
or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if
deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in § 238-24A
of this article.
G. Excessive discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of process
water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with
the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment
standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation developed by the
City of Lower Burrell, the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington or state. Dilution is permitted only where expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement.
§ 238-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-25
1:181
H. Slug or accidental discharges.
(1) Each significant industrial user shall provide protection from
accidental or slug discharge of prohibited materials or other
substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental
or slug discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained by the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed
plans showing facilities and a complete description of operating
procedures implemented to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington prior to construction of the facility. All existing
significant industrial users shall have completed the
aforementioned plan as required by this article. No industrial user
who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date
of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the
system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved
by the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the
industrial user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this article. All industrial users shall notify the Authority of any
changes at the user's facility that affect the potential for slug
discharges even if it is not anticipated that a discharge would
normally occur based on the facility changes. [Amended
7-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3-2008]
(2) A complete description of operating procedures must include, but
not be limited to, the following:
(a) A listing of all stored chemicals, including the type and nature
of chemical, maximum quantity stored, and any safety
procedures to be followed if an accidental discharge occurs.

batch discharges.
(c) A description of procedures to prevent adverse impact from
accidental or slug discharges, including but not limited to
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and
transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations,
control of site runoff, employee training, building of
containment structures or equipment for emergency response.
I. Notification.
(1) In the case of accidental or slug discharge or any discharge that
could cause problems at the POTW, it is the responsibility of the
industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of
the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge,
type of waste discharged, concentration and volume of waste
discharged and corrective actions.

(2) Within five days following an accidental or slug discharge, the
industrial user shall submit to the Municipal Sanitary Authority of
the City of New Kensington a detailed written report describing the
cause of the discharge and the measures taken by the industrial
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or
other applicable law.
J. Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent location advising
employees whom to contact in the event of an accidental or slug
discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
K. Control authority review. The Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City
of New Kensington shall, at least once every two years, evaluate
whether each industrial user will be required to develop a plan to
control accidental or slug discharges.

Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington shall promptly
notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the
volume or characteristics of pollutants in their discharge, including
the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the
industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR
402.12(p). All industrial users shall notify the Authority of any
changes at the user's facility that affect the potential for slug
discharge even if it is not anticipated that a discharge would
normally occur based on the facility changes. [Amended
7-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3-2008]
C. Permittee reporting requirements.
(1) Measurement of pollutants. The industrial user shall comply with
the requirements as specified in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(5), as amended:
§ 238-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-27
1:189
(a) The industrial user shall identify the pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process, including best
management practice where required by the pretreatment
standards or Control Authority. [Amended 7-14-2008 by
Ord. No. 3-2008]
(b) The industrial user shall submit the results of sampling and
analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass,
where required by the Standard or Control Authority) of
regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated
process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or
mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations. Sampling for all reports,
including reports from both categorical users and significant
noncategorical users, must be representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period. Additionally, the
industrial user shall submit information needed to demonstrate
compliance with any best management practice. [Amended
7-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3-2008]
(c) A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For
all other pollutants, twenty-four-hour composite samples must
be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques where feasible. The control authority may waive
flow proportional composite sampling for any industrial user
that demonstrates that flow-proportional composite sampling
is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through
time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a
minimum of four grab samples when the industrial user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of
the effluent being discharged.
(d) The industrial user shall take a minimum of one representative
sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the
requirements of § 238-27C(1).
(e) Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist, or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment
exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the industrial user should
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use
of the combined waste stream formula presented in 40 CFR
403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has
been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this
adjusted limit, along with supporting data, shall be submitted
to the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington.
§ 238-27 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-27
1:190
(f) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments
thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in questions, or where
the administrator determines that the 40 CFR 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using
validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling
and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by
the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator.
(g) The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for
industrial pretreatment measures.
(h) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such
sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles
and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
(2) Periodic compliance reports: categorical industrial users. The
following requirements must be followed by industrial users to
which categorical pretreatment standards apply:
(a) Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard, in the case of a new source after commencement of
the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington during the
months of June and December, unless required more frequently
in the pretreatment standard or by the Control Authority or
Approval Authority, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by
such categorical pretreatment standards, including best
management practices. In addition, this report shall include a
record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported.
However, the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington may require more detailed reporting of flows. At
the discretion of the Control Authority and in consideration of
such facts as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, etc., the Control Authority may agree to alter the
months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
Any categorical industrial users subject to best management
practice requirements shall submit information on compliance
with the applicable best management practice. Additionally,
the industrial user shall submit information needed to
demonstrate compliance with any best management practice.
[Amended 7-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3-2008]
§ 238-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-27
1:191
(b) Where the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington has imposed mass limitations on industrial users as
provided for by 40 CFR 403.6(d), the report required by
Subsection C(2)(a) of this section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
discharge from the industrial user.
(c) For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established by the control authority in
accordance with the procedures of 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report
required by Subsection C(2)(a) of this section shall contain a
reasonable measure of the industrial user's long-term
production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), the report required by Subsection
C(2)(a) of this section shall include the industrial user's actual
average production rate for the reporting period.
(3) Periodic compliance reports: noncategorical industrial users.
[Amended 7-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3-2008]
(a) The Control Authority shall require appropriate reporting from
those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to
categorical pretreatment standards. All noncategorical
industrial users subject to best management practice
requirements shall submit information on compliance with the
applicable best management practice.
(b) Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington at
least once every six months (in dates specified by the Control
Authority) a description of the nature, concentration and flow
of the pollutants required to be reported by the Control
Authority. These reports shall be based on sampling and
analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and
performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40
CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the Administrator determines that the 40
CFR sampling and analytical techniques are in appropriate for
the pollutants in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW or other person, approved
by the Administrator. This sampling and analysis may be
performed by the Control Authority in lieu of the significant
noncategorical industrial user. Where the POTW itself collects
all the information required for the report, the noncategorical
significant industrial user will not be required to submit the
report.
§ 238-27 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-27
1:192
(4) Compliance report deadline.
(a) Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of
a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to
pretreatment standards and requirements, including best
management practices, shall submit to the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington a report containing the
information described in § 238-27C(1) of this article. Sampling
for all reports, including reports from both categorical users
and significant noncategorical users, must be representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period. [Amended
7-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3-2008]
(b) For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established by the control authority in
accordance with the procedures of 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's
long-term production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production
(or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
industrial user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period.
(c) The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis
and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the industrial user into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This
report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user and certified in accordance with
§ 238-27B(2)(a)[14] of this article.
D. Monitoring.
(1) Monitoring and analysis. [Amended 7-14-2008 by Ord. No.
3-2008]
(a) The reports required in Subsections B(2) and C(2) and (3) of
this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis
of the discharge, including the flow and nature and
concentration, or production and mass, where required by the
Control Authority, of pollutants contained therein which are
limited by applicable pretreatment standards. This sampling
and analysis may be performed by the Control Authority in lieu
of the industrial user. Where the POTW performs the required
sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the
industrial user will not be required to submit the compliance
certification required in the aforementioned reports. In
§ 238-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-27
1:193
addition, where the POTW itself collects all the information
required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user
will not be required to submit the report.
(b) Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds. For all
other pollutants, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be
obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority. Where
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Control Authority, the samples must be
representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the
alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial
user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to
the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may
be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Control Authority, as appropriate.
(c) If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a
violation, the industrial user shall notify the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not
required to resample if:
[1] The control authority performs sampling at the industrial
user at a frequency of at least once per month; or
[2] The control authority performs sampling at the industrial
user between the time when the industrial user performs
its initial sampling and the time when the industrial user
receives the results of this sampling.
(d) The reports required in Subsection C(2) and (3) of this section
shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by
the report, which data is representative of conditions occurring
during the reporting period. The Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington shall require that frequency of
monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by
§ 238-27 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-27
1:194
industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
(e) All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the administrator pursuant to § 304(h) of the
Act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or
with any other test procedures approved by the administrator
(see 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5). Sampling shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator.
Where 40 CFR 136 does not include sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the
administrator determines that 40 CFR 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using
validated analytical methods or another sampling and
analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator.
(f) If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of
Subsection C(2) or (3) of this section monitors any pollutant
more frequently than required by the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington, using the procedures
prescribed in Subsection D(1)(d) of this section, the results of
this monitoring shall be included in the report.
E. Monitoring facilities.
(1) The Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
shall require to be provided and operated at the industrial user's
own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling
and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal
drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be
situated on the industrial user's premises, but the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington may, when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
industrial user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and so located as not to be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
(2) There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at
the expense of the industrial user.
(3) Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington and all applicable local construction standards
and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days
§ 238-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-27
1:195
following notification by the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the
City of New Kensington.
F. Inspection and sampling. The Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City
of New Kensington shall sample the discharge and inspect the facilities
of any industrial user a minimum of two times per year to ascertain
whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements
are being complied with. Owners and occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington or its representative ready
access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for inspection,
sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their
duties. The EPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial users
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where
an industrial user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with their security
guards so that, upon presentation of appropriate identification,
personnel from the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington, approval authority and the EPA will be permitted to enter,
without delay, for the purposes of performing their duties.
G. Recordkeeping requirements.
(1) Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements
established in Subsection C of this section shall maintain records of
all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by
Subsection C of this section. Such records shall include for all
samples:
(a) The dates, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the
names of the person(s) obtaining the samples.
(b) The dates analysis were performed.
(c) Who performed the analysis.
(d) The analytical techniques/methods used.
(e) The results of such analyses.
(2) Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirement
established by Subsection C of this section shall be required to
retain for a minimum of three years any records of monitoring
activities and results, or best management practices, including
records of compliance with the best management practices
(whether or not such monitoring activities, or best management
practices are required by this section) and shall make such records
available for inspection and copying by the Director, Regional
Administrator and the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington. This period of retention shall be extended during
§ 238-27 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-27
1:196
the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial
user, or when required by the Director, the Regional Administrator,
or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington.
[Amended 7-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3-2008]
(3) Any POTW to which report are submitted by an industrial user
pursuant to Subsections B(2) and C(2) and (3) of this section, shall
retain such reports, including documentation associated with any
best management practices, or information on compliance with the
best management practices, for a minimum of three years and shall
make such reports, or documentation available for inspection and
copying by the Director and the Regional Administrator. This
period of retention shall be extended during the course of any
unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the
industrial user or the operation of the POTW pretreatment program
or when requested by the Director or the Regional Administrator.
[Amended 7-14-2008 by Ord. No. 3-2008]
(4) Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirement
established by Subsection C of this section shall be required to
retain for a minimum of three years any records of monitoring
activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are
required by this section) and shall make such records available for
inspection and copying by the Director, Regional Administrator,

(5) Any POTW to which reports are submitted by an industrial user
pursuant to Subsections B(2), C(2) and (3) of this section shall
retain such reports for a minimum of three years and shall make
such reports available for inspection and copying by the director
and the regional administrator. This period of retention shall be
extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding
the discharge of pollutants by the industrial user or the operation
of the POTW pretreatment program or when requested by the
director or the regional administrator.
H. Hazardous waste notification. The industrial user shall comply with the
hazardous waste notification requirements established below:
(1) The industrial user notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste
management division director, and state hazardous waste
authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance, which, if otherwise disposed, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name
of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous,
batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100
§ 238-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-27
1:197
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the
industrial user. An identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged
during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following 12 months. All notifications must occur within 180
days of the effective date of 40 CFR 403. Industrial users who
commence discharging after the effective date of 40 CFR 403 shall
provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge
of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification
under this subsection need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notification of changed
discharges must be submitted under Subsection B(9) of this
section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply
to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring
requirements of Subsection C of this article.
(2) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection H(1)
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.30(e).
Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous
wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.30(e), requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any
hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3) In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user
must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste
division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of
such regulations.
(4) In the case of any notification made under Subsection G of this
section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in
place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes
generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
I. Pretreatment.
(1) Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all
federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limits
specified by federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the
§ 238-27 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-27
1:198
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington shall
be provided, operated and maintained at industrial user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington for review, and shall be acceptable
to the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will, in no way, relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an effluent acceptable to the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington under the provisions of this section.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington prior to the
industrial user's initiation of such changes.
(2) The Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
shall annually publish in the Valley News Dispatch, Legal Ads
Department, a list of the users which were not in compliance with
any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during
the 12 previous months in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vii).
The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions
taken against the user(s) during the same 12 months.
J. Confidential information.
(1) Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring
programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency without restriction unless the
industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
(2) When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall
not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be
made available upon written request to governmental agencies for
uses related to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, state disposal system permit
and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any
state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. In addition, all
industrial user information will be provided without any restriction,
to U.S. EPA upon which U.S. EPA will follow the confidentiality
requirements of 40 CFR 403.14 in determining what information
will be made available to the public. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
§ 238-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-27
1:199
§ 238-28. Enforcement.
(3) Information accepted by the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the
City of New Kensington or the City of Lower Burrell as confidential,
shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the
general public by the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington until and unless a ten-day notification is given to
the user.
A. Enforcement policy.
(1) All violations of pretreatment standards and requirements are
instances of noncompliance and will receive a specific enforcement
response in accordance with the Municipal Sanitary Authority of
the City of New Kensington Control Authority enforcement
response plan. Pretreatment standards and requirements are a
matter of strict liability. Hence, good faith or lack of negligence on
the user's part is no defense to a violation of pretreatment
standards and/or requirements. The enforcement responses shall
range from notices of violation to formal civil litigation and/or
termination of service, depending upon the severity of the violation.
While similar violations will receive similar enforcement responses,
some inherent discretion exists within each enforcement response
selection. For example, some violations will trigger either an
administrative action, formal civil litigation or permit revocation.
Selection of the specific enforcement response option shall be at
the sole discretion of the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington.
(2) When making determinations regarding the level of enforcement,
the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the
City of New Kensington shall take into consideration the following:
(a) Damage to air, water, land or other natural resources and their
uses.
(b) Costs of restoration and abatement.
(c) Savings to the user as a result of the violation.
(d) History of past violations by the user.
(e) Deterrence of future violations.
(f) Other relevant factors as determined by the control authority.
(3) Emergency authority.
(a) The City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington may suspend the wastewater
treatment service and/or a pretreatment permit when such
suspension is necessary, in the opinion of Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington, in order to stop an
§ 238-27 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-28
1:200
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons, to the environment, causes pass through
or interference to the POTW or causes Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington to violate any
condition of its NPDES permit or any other federal or state
permit or regulation.
(b) Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater
treatment service and/or pretreatment permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a
failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
endangerment to any individuals or the environment. The
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
shall reinstate the pretreatment permit and/or the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence shall be submitted to the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington within five days of the
date of occurrence.
B. Enforcement procedures. For violations not requiring the City of Lower
Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington to invoke its emergency authority, the following procedures
shall apply:
(1) Notice of violation. Whenever the City of Lower Burrell or the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington finds
that a user has violated or is violating this article, pretreatment
permit or any prohibition, limitation, or requirements contained
herein, the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington shall serve upon such
person a written notice stating the nature of the violation(s), which
may include the assessment of a civil penalty, and require a written
response from the user. As required by the publicly owned
treatment works penalty law, such notice shall include the name,
address, and telephone number of the control authority manager or
other person responsible for accepting appeals. Within 30 days of
the date of the notice of violation, a plan for the satisfactory
correction thereof shall be submitted to the City of Lower Burrell
and the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
by the user.
(2) Compliance schedule. When the City of Lower Burrell or the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington finds
§ 238-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-28
1:201
that a user is in violation of this article, pretreatment permit,
or requirements contained herein, the City of Lower Burrell or
the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
may require the user to submit or may itself issue a schedule of
compliance for the necessary correction.
(a) The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major
events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the pretreatment
permit requirements (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract
for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction, etc.).
(b) No increment referred to in Subsection B(1)(a) shall exceed
nine months.
(c) Not later than 14 days following each date in the compliance
schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall
submit a progress report to the City of Lower Burrell and the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the
date on which it expects to comply with this increment of
progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the
user to return construction to the schedule established. In no
event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the City of Lower Burrell and to the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington.
(3) Consent order. The City of Lower Burrell or the manager of the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington is
hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with the user responsible for the noncompliance. Such
consent orders shall include a specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified in the consent order. Consent orders shall have the same
force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to this
section.
(4) Compliance order. When the City of Lower Burrell or the Manager
of the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article,
pretreatment permit or order issued thereunder, the City of Lower
Burrell or the Manager of the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the
City of New Kensington may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period,
sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been
§ 238-28 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-28
1:202
installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such
other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the
installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring,
and management practices.
(5) Show-cause order.
(a) The City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington may order any user who causes
or allows a discharge of sewer, industrial waste, or other waste
into the POTW in violation of the provisions, requirements, or
pretreatment standards of this article or the Rules and
Regulations of the Department of Environmental Protection or
the Environmental Protection Agency to show cause before the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
why the proposed assessment of penalty and/or enforcement
action should not be taken. A notice shall be served upon the
user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by
the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
regarding the alleged violation, setting forth the specific facts
and circumstances upon which the proposed enforcement
action is to be taken, and directing the user to show cause
before the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington as to why the proposed assessment of penalty and/
or enforcement actions should not be taken.72
(b) The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) upon the
user, not less than 20 days prior to the hearing. Such notice
shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the
control authority manager or other person responsible for
accepting appeals. Within 15 days from the date of service of
the notice, the user shall file with the manager of the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington a verified
answer responding to the allegations in the notice. Allegations
in the notice which are not specifically denied shall be deemed
to have been admitted. Failure to file an answer or to
specifically deny the allegations of the notice shall constitute a
sufficient basis for the entry of a default adjudication upon
expiration of said 15 days.
(c) The Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington may itself conduct the hearing and take the
evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or
the Manager to:
[1] Issue in the name of the Municipal Sanitary Authority of
the City of New Kensington notices of hearings requesting
72.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 238-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-28
1:203
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the
production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in
such hearings.
[2] Take the evidence.
[3] Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with
recommendations to the Municipal Sanitary Authority of
the City of New Kensington for action thereon.
(d) At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken
must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The
transcript so recorded will be made available to any member of
the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the
usual charges thereof.
(e) After the Council and the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the
City of New Kensington has reviewed the evidence, it may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer
service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances shall have been
installed, or existing treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders
and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued,
including but not limited to injunctive relief and civil penalties.
(6) Cease-and-desist order. Whenever the City of Lower Burrell or the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington finds
that a user has violated or is violating this article, pretreatment
permit or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained
herein, the City or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington shall issue an order to cease and desist all such
violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
(a) Comply forthwith.
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may
be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and terminating the
discharge.
(c) As required by the publicly owned treatment works penalty
law, such notice shall include the name, address, and telephone
number of the control authority manager or other person
responsible for accepting appeals.
C. Civil proceedings. If any person discharges sewage, industrial waste, or
other wastes into the wastewater disposal system of the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington in violation of the
provisions, requirements or pretreatment standards of this article, the
§ 238-28 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-28
1:204
rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, or the Environmental Protection Agency which presents an
imminent danger or substantial harm to the POTW or the public, an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the environment, causes the
POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES permit, or has shown a
lack of ability or intention to comply with said pretreatment provisions,
requirements or standards, any other order of the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington, or the City of Lower Burrell,
or its other enforcement procedures would not be adequate to effect
prompt correction of the condition or violations, the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington or the City of Lower Burrell
may institute an action to obtain injunctive relief in the Court of
Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, where the activity has taken
place, where the condition exists, or where the public is affected.73
D. Criminal proceedings. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representations or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained
pursuant to this article or pretreatment permit, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device
or method required under this article, will be prosecuted to the extent
permitted by law under the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
E. Revocation of permit.
(1) Any user who violates the following conditions of this article or
applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having its
pretreatment permit revoked.
(a) Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge.
(b) Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations,
or wastewater constituents and characteristics.
(c) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection and/or monitoring.
(d) Violation of conditions of the pretreatment permit.
(2) If pretreatment permit is revoked, the control authority may take
steps it deems advisable, including severance of the sewer
connection, to promote compliance with this article.
F. Appeals. The user shall have such right of appeal to the court of
common pleas having jurisdiction as is provided for under § 7(b) of the
Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty Law,74 the Local Agency Law,
2 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq. or Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 762.
73.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
74.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 752.7(b).
§ 238-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-29
1:205
§ 238-29. Violations and penalties.
A. Civil penalties. Any user who is found to have violated the provisions,
requirements, or pretreatment standards of this article, the rules and
regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection or the Environmental Protection Agency, an order, rule,
regulation or permit of the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington or the City of Lower Burrell, whether or not the
violation is willful or negligent, may be assessed a civil penalty in an
amount not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation, regardless of
jurisdictional boundaries. Each violation for each separate day shall
constitute a separate and distinct offense. The Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington or the City of Lower Burrell
may recover its costs for reestablishing the operating of the POTW, in
addition to any civil penalty imposed hereunder. In addition, the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington or the City
of Lower Burrell may recover attorneys' fees, all court costs, and all
other expenses of litigation to the extent permitted by law.75
B. Civil penalty assessment policy.
(1) This section constitutes the civil penalty assessment policy
required by the Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty Law
(herein "Penalty Law") Act No. 9 of 1992, 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.
When making determinations of the level of enforcement, the City
of Lower Burrell and/or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the
City of New Kensington shall take into consideration the following:
(a) Damage to air, water, land, or other natural resources and their
uses.
(b) Costs of restoration and abatement.
(c) Savings to the user as a result of the violation.
(d) History of past violations.
(e) Deterrence of future violations.
(f) Other relevant factors as determined by the City of Lower
Burrell and/or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington.
(2) A user must usually spend money to comply with pretreatment
standards and requirements. The user makes initial capital
expenditures for pretreatment equipment or process changes and
incurs subsequent operation, maintenance, and repair costs
annually. By delaying or avoiding these costs, the user realizes and
economic advantage or benefit over a competitor which complied
with pretreatment requirements in a timely manner. Thus, the
75.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 238-29 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-29
1:206
"economic benefit" of noncompliance is defined as the difference
between the cost of on time compliance and delayed compliance.
Economic benefits realized by the user which fails to comply by a
required deadline can be measured by:
(a) The money that the user would expect to earn by delaying the
purchase of pretreatment equipment or implementation of
process changes and investing the money in more profitable
projects.
(b) The annual costs that the user avoids, and the expected return
on avoided costs, during the period of noncompliance.
(c) Any competitive advantage the user may gain, such as
increased market share over competitors already in
compliance, because of cost advantages attributed to delayed
compliance.
(3) In this article, the economic benefit calculation is focused on the
first two benefits. The "Guidance Manual for POTW's to Calculate
the Economic Benefit of Noncompliance," U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, September 5, 1990, may be applied in
calculating the penalty.
(4) Consideration of the gravity and length of a violation is important
when determining the penalty amount. Removing the economic
benefit of noncompliance only places the violation user in the
position it would have been had it complied on time. Both
deterrence and fundamental fairness require that the civil penalty
include an additional amount to ensure that noncompliance is more
costly than compliance, and the City of Lower Burrell and/or the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington's policy
will be to include such an amount.
(5) Recovering for damages to public facilities and/or natural
resources.
(a) Failure to comply with pretreatment standards and
requirements may cause damage to the collection system of
the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of
the City of New Kensington. Damage may also be caused to the
natural environment. Therefore, an additional purpose of
penalties in pretreatment enforcement shall be to recover for
such damages. Specifically, the City of Lower Burrell or the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
may determine to require that a violating user pay reparations
for any damages caused to the collection system by improper
disposal of pollutants. Such a user may also be required to pay
for replacement of equipment, facilities, and/or other damaged
processes at the POTW caused by pollutant interference.
§ 238-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-29
1:207
(b) Pollutants which pass through or interfere with POTW
processes may cause damage to natural systems in receiving
waters. In addition to assessing penalties to recover for such
damages, the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington may consider
requiring mitigation and remediation programs.
(c) The City of Lower Burrell and/or the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington will consider assessing
higher penalties for violations resulting in actual or potential
harm to the environment. Such potential environmental harm
occurs whenever a user discharges a pollutant into the sewer
system that:
[1] Passes through the POTW inadequately treated and causes
a violation of the POTW's National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit (including water
quality standards).
[2] Has a potentially toxic effect on the receiving waters (e.g.,
a fish kill).
(6) Cost of restoration and abatement. Some violations may have
negative impacts on the POTW itself. For example, such violations
may result in significant increases in treatment costs, interference,
harm POTW personnel, equipment, processes or operations, or
cause sludge contamination, resulting in increased disposal costs.
When a user's noncompliance harms the POTW, the City of Lower
Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington will assess a larger penalty.
(7) Savings to the user as a result of violation. A user which fails to
comply with pretreatment standards and requirements in a timely
manner may accrue a significant economic benefit. A penalty
assessed against the violator will be fixed at a level to at least
negate this economic benefit and make it unprofitable for the user
to ignore or violate pretreatment requirements. These
requirements include installation of pretreatment equipment, one
time expenditures (e.g., land), and operation and maintenance
(O&M) or other annual costs. The economic benefit calculation
described in this article will be applied to any or all types of
pollution control costs.
(8) History of past violation.
(a) The City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington will consider each violation in
assessing the significance of user noncompliance. Violations of
average effluent limitations will be considered a violation for
each day of the averaging period. Therefore, a monthly
average violation will be counted as 30 days of violation, a
weekly average violation as seven days of violation, and a four-
§ 238-29 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-29
1:208
day average should be counted as four violations. Violations
of different parameters at the same discharge point or outfall
are counted separately, and violations at different discharge
points or outfalls or indirect discharges are counted separately.
The amount of the penalty will be increased as the number
of violations increases. However, as provided in the Penalty
Law, a single operational upset shall only be considered as one
violation, even though it may result in simultaneous violations
of more than one pretreatment standard.
(b) The City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington shall consider increasing penalty
amounts for continuing, long-term violations. Generally, a longterm
violation is one that continues for three or more
consecutive months. In addition, penalties will be higher for
violations that have continued for three years than for
violations that have only occurred for six months.
(c) Significant noneffluent violations will be considered in
assessing penalties. Violations included in this category
include failure to report, late reporting, schedule violations,
failure to implement an approved pretreatment program,
laboratory analysis deficiencies, unauthorized discharge,
operation and maintenance (O&M) deficiencies, and sludge
handling violations.
(d) The City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington will consider increasing the
penalty amount when the violating user appears to be acting in
"bad faith" (e.g., by not cooperating with the City of Lower
Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington in effecting a timely correction of the violation);
when the user experiences unjustified delays in preventing,
correcting, or mitigating violations; when the user has already
violated prior administrative orders, compliance agreements,
or consent decrees; or when the user fails to provide timely
and full information. This recalcitrance factor also may be
increased during negotiation if the user continues to resist
efforts to settle.
(e) When a user demonstrates that it is unable to pay a settlement
penalty, the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington will independently
evaluate the user's ability to pay. When it is determined that
the user cannot afford to pay the penalty or that payment of all
or part of the penalty will preclude the violator from achieving
compliance, the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington may consider
other options. For example, the City of Lower Burrell or the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
may consider an installment payment plan with the user paying
§ 238-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-29
1:209
interest. Only as a last recourse, the City of Lower Burrell or
the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
may consider reducing the penalty amount. If the user's
behavior has been exceptionally culpable, recalcitrant, or
threatening to human health and the environment, inability to
pay will be disregarded.
(9) Deterrence of future violations.
(a) A user shall install the appropriate pollution control equipment
to comply with applicable pretreatment regulations,
maintaining compliance, required continuing O&M and other
annual expenditures. For users which fail to comply with
pretreatment requirements, the City of Lower Burrell or the
Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington
will set its penalties at a level to remove, at a minimum, the
economic benefit from avoided annual costs during its period
of violations. The City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington hereby
determines that assessing a penalty which, as a minimum,
eliminates the economic benefit of noncompliance (or makes
noncompliance more expensive than compliance) will
encourage users to remain in compliance.
(b) The intent of these penalties is to deter noncompliance so that
pollutant discharges by a user do not have significant negative
impacts on the POTW, collection system, or receiving waters.
The City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority
of the City of New Kensington's policy will be not to assess a
penalty that is too small (e.g., less than the economic benefit of
noncomplying), so that the violating user and other users may
determine that noncompliance is more expensive than
compliance.
(c) The EPA or DEP can take enforcement action against a user
violating the Clean Water Act, including federal pretreatment
standards and regulations. Citizens or citizen groups can also
bring civil suits against a user for violating environmental
regulations. If the violating user has been sued by the EPA,
state regulatory agency, or citizens or citizen groups, and
penalties were imposed upon the user from these actions, the
City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the
City of New Kensington may consider reducing the penalty by
an amount equal to that which the user already paid for the
same violation.76
(10) Other relevant factors.

§ 238-29 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 238-29
1:210
(a) In order to treat all users fairly and equitably, the City of Lower
Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington will use its best efforts to assess penalties using a
consistent methodology. Thus, it will avoid allowing one user to
realize an economic benefit from noncompliance which would
potentially enable it to gain an economic advantage over the
complying users. By assessing a penalty based on economic
benefit, the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary
Authority of the City of New Kensington will strive to eliminate
or remove any financial advantage the violator gains.
(b) By exercising a consistent penalty methodology, the City of
Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington ensure that all violators are treated equitably.
While the amount of the penalty will vary from case to case, the
methods used to develop the penalty will be consistent.
C. EPA policy followed.
(1) The City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the
City of New Kensington will take into account the policies of EPA in
setting penalties. EPA defines "significant noncompliance" in its
revisions to the general pretreatment regulations [40 CFR
403.8(f)(2)(vii)] as violations which meet one or more of the
following criteria:
(a) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here
as those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken
during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily
maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant
parameter.
(b) Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which 33% or more of all of the measurements for
each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period
equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit (TRC =
1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH).
(c) Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily
maximum or longer-term average) that the City of Lower
Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New
Kensington determines has caused, alone or in combination
with other dischargers, interferences or pass through
(including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the
general public).
(d) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment
or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency
authority under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B) to halt or prevent
such a discharge.
§ 238-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-29
1:211
(e) Failure to meet, within 90 days after the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control
mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction,
completing construction, or attaining final compliance.
(f) Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day
compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and
reports on compliance with compliance schedules.
(g) Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
(h) Any other violation or group of violations which the City of
Lower Burrell or the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of
New Kensington determines will adversely affect the operation
or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(2) Violation of the pretreatment standards and requirements which
constitute significant noncompliance are considered to be the most
serious violation and require a strong and immediate response.
Assessment of civil penalties may occur for significant
noncompliance.
(3) In addition to assessing appropriate penalties commensurate with
the factors listed above, the City of Lower Burrell or the Municipal
Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington shall consider
assessing larger penalties in cases of repeat violations, including
all violations of permit effluent limitations, monitoring and
reporting requirements and other standard and special discharge
conditions. This consideration produces flexibility in assessing
penalties for multiple violations.
D. Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representation or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained
pursuant to this article, or pretreatment permit, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device
or method required under this article, shall upon conviction, be
punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of
payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed
30 days. Each occurrence shall be a separate offense. This section shall
not preclude prosecution under the Crimes Code.
E. Remedies cumulative and concurrent. The remedies provided for in this
article are intended to be concurrent and cumulative, and the
provisions of this article, shall not abridge or later any right of action or
remedy, now or hereafter existing in law, or under the common law or
statutory law, criminal or civil, available to the City of Lower Burrell or
the Municipal Sanitary Authority of the City of New Kensington.

and a representative of DEP; then action by the property owner to
mitigate the malfunction shall be required.
G. If there arises a geographic area where numerous on-lot sewage
disposal systems are malfunctioning, a resolution of these areawide
problems may necessitate detailed planning and a revision to the
portion of the Sewage Facilities Plan pertaining to areas affected by
such malfunctions. If a DEP authorized Official Sewage Facilities Plan
Revision has been undertaken, repair or replacement of individual
malfunctioning sewage disposal systems within the area affected by the

depth of the tank. Receipts from the pumper/hauler shall be submitted
to the City within the prescribed six-month and three-year pumping
periods.
B. The required pumping frequency may be increased at the discretion of
an authorized agent if the septic tank is undersized, if solids buildup in
the tank is above average, if the hydraulic load on the system increases
significantly above average, if a garbage grinder is used in the building,
if the system malfunctions or for other good cause shown. If any person
can prove that such person's septic tank had been pumped within three
years of the six-month anniversary of the effective date of this article,
then that person's initial required pumping may be delayed to conform
to the general three-year frequency requirement except where an
inspection reveals a need for more frequent pumping frequencies.
C. Any person owning a property served by a septic tank shall submit, with
each required pumping receipt, a written statement, from the pumper/
hauler or from any other qualified individual acceptable to the City, that
the baffles in the septic tank have been inspected and found to be in
good working order. Any person whose septic tank baffles are
determined to require repair or replacement shall first contact a
sewage enforcement officer for approval of the necessary repair.
D. Any person owning or building served by an on-lot sewage disposal
system which contains an aerobic treatment tank shall follow the
operation and maintenance recommendations of the equipment
manufacturer. A copy of the manufacturer's recommendations and a
copy of the service agreement shall be submitted to the City within six
months of the effective date of this article. Thereafter, service receipts
shall be submitted to the City at the intervals specified by the
manufacturer's recommendations. In no case may the service or
pumping intervals for aerobic treatment tanks exceed those required
for septic tanks.
E. Additional maintenance activity may be required as needed including,
but not necessarily limited to, cleaning and unclogging of piping,
servicing and the repair of mechanical equipment, leveling of
distribution boxes, tanks and lines, removal of obstructing roots or
trees, the diversion of surface water away from the disposal area, etc.
A. No person shall operate or maintain an on-lot sewage disposal system
in such a manner that it malfunctions. All liquid wastes, including
kitchen and laundry wastes and water softener backwash, shall be

1:222
discharged to a treatment tank. No sewage system shall discharge
untreated or partially treated sewage to the surface of the ground
or into the waters of the commonwealth unless a permit for such
discharge has been obtained from DEP.
B. A written notice of violation shall be issued to any person who is the
owner of any property which is found to be served by a malfunctioning
on-lot sewage disposal system or which is discharging sewage without a
permit.
C. Within seven days of notification by the City that a malfunction has
been identified, the property owner shall make application to the
sewage enforcement officer for a permit to repair or replace the
malfunctioning system. Within 30 days of initial notification by the City,
construction of the permitted repair or replacement shall commence.
Within 60 days of the original notification by the City, the construction
shall be completed unless seasonal or unique conditions mandate a
longer period, in which case, the City shall set an extended completion
date.
D. A sewage enforcement officer shall have the authority to require the
repair of any malfunction by the following methods: cleaning, repair or
replacement of components of the existing system, adding capacity or
otherwise altering or replacing the system's treatment tank, expanding
the existing disposal areas, replacing the existing disposal area,
replacing a gravity distribution system with a pressurized system,
replacing the system with a holding tank, or any other alternative
appropriate for the specific site.
E. In lieu of, or in combination with, the remedies described in Subsection
D above, a sewage enforcement officer may require the installation of
water conservation equipment and the institution of water conservation
practices in structures served. Water-using devices and appliances in
the structure may be required to be retrofitted with water-saving
appurtenances or they may be required to be replaced by waterconserving
devices.
F. In the event that the rehabilitation measures in Subsections A through
E are not feasible or effective, the owner may be required to apply for a
permit to install an individual spray irrigation treatment system or to
DEP for a single residence treatment and discharge system. Upon
receipt of said permit, the owner shall complete construction of the
system within 30 days.
G. Should none of the remedies described in this section be totally
effective in eliminating the malfunction of an existing on-lot sewage
disposal system, the property owner is not absolved of responsibility for
that malfunction. The City may require whatever action is necessary to
lessen or mitigate the malfunction to the extent necessary.
§ 238-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-43
1:223
§ 238-43. Liens.

Treasurer, in his/her discretion, only under the following circumstances:
then have a plumber or testing agency perform tests on the property to
be sold. The plumber or testing agency shall complete the appropriate
portions on the form that the property has been tested, and verify and
affirm the results of such tests.
B. When an illegal storm or surface water connection is discovered by the
means of the above-mentioned testing, a notice will be issued to the
applicant informing the applicant of the illegal connection and that a
municipal lien and property tax verification letter will not be issued
until the illegal connections are removed.
A. When in the opinion of the City Engineer, such testing cannot be
performed because of weather conditions, the applicant shall provide
the City Treasurer with:
(1) Security in the amount of $200 or such other amount as may be set
from time to time by resolution of the City Council, to guarantee
that the present and/or future property owner will submit to
performance of the tests required on the City form, Plumber's

estate, agreeing to correct any violations that may be discovered as
the result of subsequent tests and agreeing that no building or
occupancy or land use approval of any kind will be issued for the
said property until all required corrective work has been
completed.
B. Nothing in this article shall prohibit any purchaser from requiring the
applicant to reimburse the purchaser for any costs incurred; provided,
nevertheless, that primary liability shall run with the land and no such
agreement shall affect the City's enforcement powers or excuse the
current owner from performance.
C. When illegal stormwater or surface water connections have been
discovered and the necessary remedial activities to correct such illegal
connection would require a length of time, in excess of two months,
such as to create a practical hardship for the applicant, the applicant
may ask the City Council to accept a temporary plumber's inspection
report, which may only be accepted when the applicant provides the
City with all of the following:

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 252-1. Introduction.
Stormwater management consists of the planning, design, and control of
the conveyance and storage of surface waters resulting from precipitation.
Major objectives are the protection of water quality, the prevention of
flooding and erosion, and the promotion of the natural recharge of
groundwater. The Pennsylvania Stormwater Management Act86 was enacted
in 1978 to address these crucial issues. The intent of the Act is to encourage
stormwater runoff planning and management, with the program
administered locally, consistent with the commonwealth's duty as trustee of
natural resources and the people's constitutional right to the preservation
of the environment. The Act places major responsibility for managing
stormwater on the landowner or developer.
§ 252-2. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Lower Burrell
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 252-3. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes,
flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood-control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety, and increases non-point-source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
D. Green infrastructure.
(1) The use of green infrastructure and low-impact development (LID)
are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment
86.Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
§ 252-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-3
1:241
§ 252-4. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 252-3 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
by using systems and practices which use or mimic natural
processes to:
(a) Infiltrate and recharge;
(b) Evapotranspire; and/or
(c) Harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth.
(2) Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of predevelopment hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) program.
A. To the extent practicable, meet legal water quality requirements under
state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect,
maintain, reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the
waters of the commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems
close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source with a minimum
of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards, and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and best management
practices (BMPs) that are constructed and implemented.
J. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.

§ 252-5. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect

Terminology
§ 252-14. Interpretation.
For the purposes of this chapter, certain terms and words used herein shall
be interpreted as follows:
§ 252-15. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  Activities associated with agriculture, such as
agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal heavy-use areas.
This includes the work of producing crops, including tillage, land clearing,
plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting crops or pasturing and
raising of livestock and installation of conservation measures. Construction
of new buildings or impervious area is not considered an agricultural
activity.

application to the municipality for approval to engage in any regulated
activity at a project site in the municipality.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities, designs,
measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from
regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote
groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this chapter.
Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories
or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural." In this chapter, "nonstructural
BMPs or measures" refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices
that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff,
whereas "structural BMPs or measures" are those that consist of a physical
device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands,
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
A. Words used in the present tense include the future tense; the singular
number includes the plural, and the plural number includes the
singular; words of masculine gender include feminine gender; and
words of feminine gender include masculine gender.
B. The word "includes" or "including" shall not limit the term to the
specific example but is intended to extend its meaning to all other
instances of like kind and character.
C. The words "shall" and "must" are mandatory; the words "may" and
"should" are permissive.
D. These definitions do not necessarily reflect the definitions contained in
pertinent regulations or statutes and are intended for this chapter only.

Chapter 102.
DEP  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
DESIGN STORM  The magnitude and temporal distribution of
precipitation from a storm event measured in probability of occurrence
(e.g., a five-year storm) and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design and
evaluation of stormwater management systems. Also see "return period."
DETENTION VOLUME  The volume of runoff that is captured and
released into the waters of the commonwealth at a controlled rate.
DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE)  See "project site."
DISTURBED AREA  An unstabilized land area where an earth disturbance
activity is occurring or has occurred.
EARTH DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY  A construction or other human activity
which disturbs the surface of the land, including, but not limited to: clearing
and grubbing; grading; excavations; embankments; road maintenance;
building construction; and the moving, depositing, stockpiling, or storing of
soil, rock, or earth materials.
EROSION  The natural process by which the surface of the land is worn
away by water, wind, or chemical action.
EXISTING CONDITION  The dominant land cover during the five-year
period immediately preceding a proposed regulated activity.

natural source or delineated by applicable FEMA maps and studies as being
a special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that comprise Group 13
soils, as listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania DEP Technical Manual for
Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by
the DEP).
FLOODWAY  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of the
adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge
the one-hundred-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of
the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided
by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies have defined the
boundary of the one-hundred-year floodway, it is assumed, absent evidence
to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the stream to 50 feet from
the top of the bank of the stream.

depressions, sinkholes, rock pinnacles/uneven bedrock surface,
underground drainage, and caves. Karst is formed on carbonate rocks, such
as limestone or dolomite.
LAND DEVELOPMENT (DEVELOPMENT)  Inclusive of any or all of the
following meanings:
LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  Site design approaches and smallscale
stormwater management practices that promote the use of natural
systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can

§ 252-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-15
1:249
be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects.
LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store
runoff close to its source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance
and treatment systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of
small, cost-effective landscape features located on-site.
MUNICIPALITY  City of Lower Burrell, Westmoreland County,
Pennsylvania.
NRCS  USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (previously SCS).

is captured and not released directly into the surface waters of this
commonwealth during or after a storm event.
RETURN PERIOD  The average interval, in years, within which a storm
event of a given magnitude can be expected to occur one time. For example,
the twenty-five-year return period rainfall would be expected to occur on
average once every 25 years; or stated in another way, the probability of a
twenty-five-year storm occurring in any one year is 0.04 (i.e., a 4% chance).
RIPARIAN BUFFER  A permanent area of trees and shrubs located
adjacent to streams, lakes, ponds and wetlands.
RUNOFF  Any part of precipitation that flows over the land.
SEDIMENT  Soils or other materials transported by surface water as a
product of erosion.

J. The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the municipality believes may
pose a threat to public health, safety, property or the environment.
K. Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 252-16D through M.
A. The low-impact development practices provided in the Pennsylvania
SWM BMP Manual shall be utilized for all regulated activities to the
maximum extent practicable.
B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method, as defined below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the applicant
may select either method on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures
associated with each methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any size regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
§ 252-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-18
1:259
§ 252-19. Rate controls.
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases, at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration
tests shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual.
Notification of the municipality shall be provided to allow
witnessing of the testing.
C. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed predevelopment
discharge rates for the two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and onehundred-
year, twenty-four-hour storm events. If it is shown that the
peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis
are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by
the predevelopment analysis for two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements
of this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall
provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of
discharge requirement.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan:
§ 252-18 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 252-19
1:260
§ 252-20. Sensitive areas and stormwater hotspots.
(1) For the two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour storm events, the post-development peak
discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate
maps. For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the postdevelopment
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates.
A. Sensitive areas and water-quality-sensitive developments, as defined
below, which require special consideration with regard to stormwater
management.
(1) "Sensitive areas" are defined as those areas that, if developed, have
the potential to endanger a water supply. These areas consist of the
delineated one-year zone of contribution and direct upslope areas
tributary to the water supply wells. The City of Lower Burrell may
update the sensitive area boundaries based on new research or
studies as required.
(2) "Stormwater hotspots" are defined as a land development project
that has a high potential to endanger local water quality and could
potentially threaten groundwater reservoirs. The Municipal
Engineer will determine what constitutes these classifications on a
case-by-case basis. The PA DEP wellhead protection contaminant
source list shall be used as a guide in these determinations.
Industrial manufacturing site and hazardous material storage
areas must provide NPDES SIC codes.
B. Performance standards.
(1) The location of the boundaries of sensitive areas is set by drainage
areas tributary to any public water supply. The exact location of
these boundaries, as they apply to a given development site, shall
be determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines
the limits of the sensitive area. If the project site is within the
sensitive area (in whole or in part), two-foot contour interval
mapping shall be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area.
If the project site is adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of a
defined sensitive area, a five-foot contour interval map defining the
limits of the sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater
management plan to document the site's location relative to the
sensitive area.
(2) Stormwater hotspots may be required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan and file notice of intent as
required under the provision of the EPA industrial stormwater
NPDES permit requirements.
(3) Stormwater hotspots must use an acceptable pretreatment BMP
prior to volume control and/or rate control BMPs. Acceptable
§ 252-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-20
1:261
§ 252-21. Protected watersheds.
For any regulated activity within a protected watershed (high-quality or
exceptional-value), the applicant shall meet requirements as contained in
25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 as required and applicable.
§ 252-22. Design criteria.
pretreatment BMPs for these developments include those based
on filtering, settling, or chemical reaction processes such as
coagulation.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(a) The watersheds are subwatersheds of a common watershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(b) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(c) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow-type condition.
(3) Innovative stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are
encouraged (e.g., rooftop storage, dry wells, cisterns, recreation
area ponding, diversion structures, porous pavements, holding
tanks, infiltration systems, in-line storage in storm sewers, and
grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and constructed
in accordance with the latest technical guidance published by the
PA DEP, provided that they are accompanied by detailed
engineering plans and performance capabilities and supporting
site-specific soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration
rate data to verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from
other sources may be accepted at the discretion of the Municipal
Engineer. (A preapplication meeting is suggested.)
(4) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(5) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
municipality shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
§ 252-20 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 252-22
1:262
would result in the continuation or exacerbation of a documented
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
(6) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses, including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Consultation with the municipality and prior approval are
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
(a) Multiple-use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
(7) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under Pa. Code Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
B. Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) All areas of a subdivision, land development plan or mobile home
park to be developed with streets, residential lots or sites,
recreation areas or other uses shall be graded to assure positive
drainage.
(2) Storm sewers, culverts and related installations shall be provided
to ensure the controlled flow of natural watercourses and to
guarantee the drainage of all low points along the curb- or gutter
lines, as well as at intervals related to the slope of all streets in or
adjacent to the plan. Where driveways cross curb- or gutter lines, a
pipe below the driveway entrance of the type and size required by
the City of Lower Burrell Engineer shall be required.
(3) In designing the stormwater management facility, the developer
shall use as his guide the publication "Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds," Technical Release No. 55, United States Department
of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, June 1986, and as
amended.96
(a) The predevelopment condition shall be as defined in § 252-15,
Definitions, regarding "existing condition." If the property has
been partially or completely developed at the time of purchase,
96.Editor's Note: See Article IX of this chapter, Reference 2.
§ 252-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-22
1:263
the City Council, at its option, may require the new owner,
if he proposes to redevelop or further develop the property,
to take remedial action for compliance with the requirements
of this subsection. If remedial action is required, regardless
of the condition of the surface, the design runoff shall not
exceed curve number 75 applied to Class C "good meadow"
soils. (See Tables 2-1 and 2-2 of TR-55.) The developer may
pass through stormwater originating upstream of his property,
but if he elects to control it, bypass devices he installs shall
be capable of handling the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour
peak flow. If a property is to be laid out in lots, no reduction
in lot size shall be permitted to accommodate storm drainage
detention structures.
(b) The developer shall consult with the Westmoreland County
Conservation District before developing his/her stormwater
management plans. The municipality and others reviewing a
stormwater control plan will use discretion in considering
unusual conditions such as drainage from several basins on the
same property under development.
(4) The stormwater management plan of a subdivision, land
development plan or mobile home park shall be designed to assure
that, after development, stormwater does not leave the property at
a greater velocity or volume per second than before development
commenced.
(a) Outlet works shall be designed so as to store water and control
runoff for all storms of frequency up to and including the onehundred-
year storm.
(b) Vertical riser pipes with trash racks and anti-vortex devices
shall be provided in detention basins, unless an alternate
design is approved by the municipality.
(c) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a municipal or state
roadway without approval from the municipality or PennDOT.
(5) Detention areas, where required to impede runoff, shall be
designed to meet or exceed the following standards:
(a) Except where a permanent pond is approved by the
municipality, detention areas shall be designed to drain
completely.
(b) The height of the embankment shall be not more than 10 feet
measured between the top of the embankment and the toe of
the slope on the downstream side of the embankment. The
level of water within the impoundment shall not exceed nine
feet measured between the lowest point in the impoundment
§ 252-22 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 252-22
1:264
area behind the embankment and the top of the emergency
spillway.
(c) The area to be occupied by the embankment shall be cleared of
all topsoil and organic materials prior to construction. The
embankment shall be built up in layers not to exceed six inches
in depth with equipment providing 95% compaction at
optimum moisture conditions.
(d) The settled elevation of the top of the embankment at its lowest
point shall be not less than one foot above the maximum water
level to be impounded behind the embankment and not less
than two feet above the elevation of the emergency spillway.
(e) The surfaces of the embankment shall be planted in a mixture
of perennial quick-catching grasses.
(f) The interior and exterior side slopes of the embankment shall
not slope on either side less than one foot vertical rise for each
two feet of horizontal run and not more than a total on both
sides of one foot vertical rise for each five feet of horizontal
run.
(g) The horizontal drain pipe passing through the embankment
shall be reinforced concrete pipe or equivalent. Anti-seepage
collars shall be placed in accordance with proper design
procedures. The design and spacing of the collars shall be
submitted for review.
(h) The top of the riser pipe to drain the pond shall be not less than
three feet in height above the invert elevation of the horizontal
pipe, shall be not less than six inches in diameter and shall be
fitted with an anti-vortex device and a trash rack.
(i) The emergency spillway shall be capable of passing the flow
created by the unattenuated one-hundred-year storm.
(j) The low edge of a parking area, curbed or not, may serve the
purpose of an emergency spillway to pass the overflow from a
stormwater detention area, provided that the embankment
below the edge is well stabilized with planting materials and
the angle of the slope will not encourage erosion, in the opinion
of the municipality and other reviewing agencies. Parking
areas shall not be used to store stormwater.
(k) Unless specifically designed as a volume control facility, stone
low-flow channels with underdrains shall be installed in all
aboveground earthen detention facilities. Side slopes and
channel slopes within the basin shall be 2% minimum.
(6) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
§ 252-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-22
1:265
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table.
The invert of stormwater facilities may be lowered if adequate
subsurface drainage is provided. Flows from underdrains need not
be accounted for in volume or rate control calculations.
(7) Unless specifically designed as a volume control facility, all
stormwater management facilities shall have a minimum slope of
2% extending radially out from the principal outlet structure.
Facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs may have a
bottom slope of zero.
(8) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for all
stormwater management basins and be specific for each type of
basin.
(a) Minimal maintenance, saturation-tolerant vegetation must be
provided in basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
(9) Written design reports and calculations shall be submitted for
review and approval by the municipality. Routing calculations using
modified PULS methodology shall be included to assure outflow
rates are in conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
Calculations for storm pipe sizing shall also be included using the
Rational Method and Manning's Formula for a ten-year storm
unless conditions warrant otherwise using PennDOT intensityduration-
frequency curves from the Engineering Design Manual
(latest edition).
(10) The owner or developer shall enter into a legal agreement
approved by the Municipal Solicitor which shall hold the
municipality harmless from any and all liability relating to storm
drainage collection and its discharge during construction of the
system and thereafter. The owner or developer shall secure, where
necessary, off-site easements for storm drainage.
(11) The costs of review and inspection by the Municipal Engineer of
the stormwater management system as proposed by the developer
shall be borne by the developer, whether or not the plan is
ultimately approved. The Engineer shall review any changes as the
developer may make in his plan for compliance with the Engineer's
recommendations and shall advise the City Council whether the
revised plan is in compliance or not. The Council shall direct the
Engineer to inspect an approved embankment or any other
proposed design element during its various stages of construction
and to point out to the contractor, the developer and Council any
deviations from the design as approved.
(12) Catch basins shall meet the municipal standards and shall have
inverts poured to allow self-cleaning. Catch basins shall be located
no further apart than 300 feet, measured between catch basins on
the same side of the street.
§ 252-22 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 252-22
1:266
§ 252-23. Calculation methodology.
(13) Graded areas shall be stabilized with erosion-resisting plantings
placed immediately after the completion of grading. Graded slopes
produced by placing fill earth over the preexisting surface shall be
keyed in accordance with sound geotechnical practices.
(14) Grades for embankments shall not exceed one foot vertical rise for
every two feet of horizontal run for fill slopes or one foot vertical
rise for every 1 1/2 feet horizontal run for slopes created by
excavating in areas that have lain dormant for at least two years.
Steeper slopes may be permitted in areas where, in the opinion of a
professional engineer, as evidenced in a written report, concurred
with by the Municipal Engineer, conditions are such as to allow
slopes up to a maximum grade determined by the engineers.
(15)No grading shall occur within five feet of any subdivision or
development plan boundary, except as is needed for the entrance of
streets or to grade off land immediately adjacent to a street to the
street's elevation.
(16) All persons, partnerships or corporations intending to excavate, fill
or grade land in the municipality shall be required to undertake all
work in conformance with the requirements of this chapter and
applicable regulations of Westmoreland County.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual, as amended herein.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Methodology.
Other methods shall be selected by the design professional based on
the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site and approved by the Municipal Engineer.
C. Rainfall values.
(1) Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Natural Resources
Conservation Service Type II, twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution
shall be used in conjunction with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas
14. A copy of the rainfall data from NOAA Atlas 14 shall accompany
the SWM report for review.
D. Runoff volume.
(1) Rational Method. Not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
§ 252-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-23
1:267
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development
with curve numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is not
acceptable.
E. Peak flow rates.
(1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities. Extreme caution should be used by the
design professional if the watershed has more than one main
drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method.
(a) This method is recommended for design of stormwater
management facilities and where stormwater runoff volume
must be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
[1] NRCS's TR-55: limited to 100 acres in size.
[2] NRCS's TR-20, WinTR-20, WinTR-55, HEC-HMS: no
watershed size limitations.
[3] Other models as preapproved by the Municipal Engineer.
(b) The NRCS Antecedent Runoff Condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
(c) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a
tenth of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
F. Runoff coefficients.
(1) Rational Method. Use Table B-1 (Appendix B).97
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. Use Table B-2 (Appendix B). Curve
numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in hydrologic
models as they are a design tool with statistical variability. For
large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded to the nearest
whole number.
97.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 252-23 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 252-23
1:268
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious area conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow (good condition).
G. Design storm.
(1) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year
hydrographs through the facility using the storage indication
method or modified PULS method. The design storm hydrograph
shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full
hydrograph.
(2) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
(3) All structures (culverts or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal road shall be designed to pass the twenty-five-year
design storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured
below the lowest point along the top of the roadway.
H. Time of concentration.
(1) The time of concentration is to represent the average condition that
best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following
time of concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be
used unless another method is preapproved by the Municipal
Engineer:
(a) Predevelopment; NRCS's Lag Equation:
Time of concentration = Tc
Tc = (T\0.6) * 60 (minutes)
T = l0.8 (S + 1)0.7\1900Y5
Where:
T = Lag time (hours).
l = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet).
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent).
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by:
S = [(1,000/CN) - 10].
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed.
§ 252-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-23
1:269
(b) Post-development; commercial, industrial, or other areas with
large impervious areas (> 20% impervious area) - NRCS
Segmental Method. The length of sheet flow shall be limited to
100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's Equation.
(c) Post-development; residential, cluster, or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area: NRCS Lag
Equation or NRCS Segmental Method.
(2) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The post-development Tc shall never be greater than the
predevelopment Tc for any watershed or subwatershed. This
includes when the designer has specifically used swales to
reduce flow velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the post-development Tc is greater, it will still be set by
default equal to the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
(b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute Tc for any
post-development watershed or subwatershed without
providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc cannot be assumed
for predevelopment.
I. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's Equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. The Manning's Equation should not
be used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from PennDOT's
Drainage Manual, Publication 584. Inlet control shall be checked at all
inlet boxes to ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design
event is contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
J. The municipality has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and recommendation of the
municipality.

ARTICLE IV
Road Bonding
[Adopted 5-9-1988 by Ord. No. 3-1988]
§ 256-23. General provisions.
A. Statement of findings. The City Council of the City of Lower Burrell
finds that inadequate regulation of highway weight restrictions, such as
those authorized under § 4902 of the Vehicle Code (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 4902)
by vehicles and combinations having a gross weight in excess of the
posted weight limit results in increased consumption of public assets
for restoration designed to support heavy truck loads. Consequently,
many are being badly damaged. A comprehensive program of posting
and bonding policies is needed to address this problem by requiring
heavy haulers to be financially responsible for excessive maintenance
on roads they use.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote the public health,
safety and welfare by minimizing the damages described in Subsection
A of this section by provisions designed to:
(1) Control accelerated maintenance of roadways due to frequent or
excessively heavy loads at their source by regulating the activities
which cause such problems.
(2) Utilize and preserve existing roadway structures and bridges in
such a way to reduce excessive maintenance.
(3) Cause heavy haulers to be financially responsible for excessive
maintenance through posting and bonding policies.
(4) Maintaining existing roadways and drainage structures in a
condition suitable to insure public health, safety and welfare.
(5) Preserve and restore carrying capacities to municipal roadways
and thereby maintain such roads for simultaneous use by both
passenger vehicles which are not subject to bonding and heavy
haulers.
C. Statutory authority. The City of Lower Burrell is empowered to regulate
these activities by the authority of §§ 4902 and 6103 of the Vehicle Code
(75 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 4902 and 6103).
(1) The provisions of this chapter apply to bridges located on posted
roads but do not apply to bridges posted independently of these
roads.
(2) The posting authority for municipal roads in the City of Lower
Burrell is the City Council or their appointed representative.
D. Applicability.
§ 256-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 256-23
1:301
(1) Exemptions. All local traffic as defined in § 256-24 is exempt unless
it is determined by the posting authority they excessively damage
the road.
(2) Bond haulers responsibility. The hauler must pay for all excess
maintenance repair costs on the bonded section of road. The
company can choose from one of two options to repair road. They
include:
(a) The hauler or its contractor can make repairs to City specs.
(b) The posting authority or its contractor can repair the road and
bill the hauler for the work. The option in Subsection D(2)(a) is
preferred.
(c) If two or more haulers are using the same posted road, they
should determine how the responsibility for the road should be
split. One hauler should contact the other hauler and try to
mutually agree on sharing responsibility for bonding and
repairing of the road. If the haulers cannot come to a mutual
agreement, the posting authority will determine the relative
responsibility for each hauler. In either case, written
agreements will then be executed between the bonding
authority and each hauler.
(d) Recourse among haulers. One hauler should contact the other
hauler and try to mutually agree on sharing responsibility for
bonding and repairing of the road. If a hauler is unwilling to
share the responsibility and continues to haul on the road, the
City Engineer should be contacted. The City and the police are
responsible for enforcing the program and they will contact
any haulers committing possible violations.
(e) The hauler's truck may not exceed the established gross
weight and actual limits on the bonded highway because the
Vehicle Code authorizes the City to waive only the weight in
excess of restrictions. The regular gross and actual weight
laws must be observed.
(f) The regulations applies only to posted highways and to bridges
on posted highways unless the bridge has a posted limit of its
own. If a bridge has its own weight restrictions, a permit may
be issued separately in accordance with Chapter 191 of the
Department of Transportation Regulations. See Chapter 285,
Article III, for listing of weight limits on various streets.
E. Compatibility with other permit ordinance requirements. Permits and
approvals issued pursuant to this article do not relieve the applicant of
the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance. If more
stringent requirements concerning regulation of weight limits are
§ 256-23 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 256-23
1:302
§ 256-24. Definitions.
The following words and terms when used in this article shall have the
following meaning unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
EXCESS MAINTENANCE  Maintenance or restoration or both, but not
betterment of the posted highway in excess of normal maintenance caused
by use of over-posted-weight vehicles. Excessive maintenance is
maintenance required due to heavy hauling in excess of usual and routine
activities. Normal maintenance activities include minor patching, cutting
shoulders and repairing worn-out pipes. Excess maintenance activities
include, but are not limited to, excessive patching and base repair, shaping
of shoulders that are pushed and heaved due to heavy hauling, and
replacement of crushed pipes. The existence of damage requiring excess
maintenance and the scope of that excess maintenance will be handled in
accordance with § 256-25B(3), Excessive maintenance agreement.
LOCAL TRAFFIC  The following shall be regarded as local traffic for the
purpose of this article:
NORMAL MAINTENANCE  Usual and typical activities necessary to
maintain a roadway, shoulders and drainage facilities in the state of repair
existing at the date of inspection prescribed in § 256-14B(6).
OVER-POSTED-WEIGHT VEHICLE  A vehicle or combination having a
gross weight in excess of the posted weight limit.
POSTED HIGHWAY  A roadway having a posted weight limit.
POSTED WEIGHT LIMIT  A restricted weight limit posted on a roadway
under authority of § 256-23.
POSTING AUTHORITY  The Mayor and Council of the City of Lower
Burrell or their designee.
§ 256-25. Road bonding regulations.
contained in another code, rule, act or ordinance, the more stringent
regulation shall apply.
A. Fire and emergency vehicles.
B. School buses.
Vehicles and combinations of governmental agencies and utilities or
other contractors engaged in construction or maintenance on a posted
roadway or in a location which can be reached only by a posted
roadway.
C.
Vehicles and combinations going to or coming from a residence,
commercial establishment or farm located on a posted roadway or
which can be reached only by a posted roadway.
D.
A. General requirements; local traffic.
§ 256-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 256-25
1:303
(1) General rule. Over-posted-weight local traffic may exceed posted
weight limits unless the posting authority determines that an overposted-
weight vehicle or vehicles being driven to or from a
particular destination or destinations are likely to damage the
highway.
(2) Vehicles determined likely to damage highway. If the posting
authority determines that one or more over-posted-weight vehicles
are likely to damage the highway, the posting authority will so
notify the registrants of the over-posted-weight vehicles or owners
of the destination or destinations, or both, and will also notify state
and/or local police, as applicable. After two business days following
delivery of the notice, or after five days following mailing of notice,
such over-posted-weight vehicles shall not exceed the posted
weight limits except in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection B of this section (relating to use under permit).
(3) Proof of local traffic status. The following types of documents will
constitute evidence that a vehicle is local traffic:
(a) A bill of lading, shipping order, or similar document which
shows a destination on the posted highway.
(b) Certification by the permittee or an official of a permittee
company on the company letterhead describing the local traffic
nature of the activity which the vehicle is engaged in.
B. Use under permit.
(1) General rule. No over-posted-weight vehicle, except local traffic
authorized under Subsection A(1) of this section (relating to local
traffic), shall be driven on a posted highway with a gross weight in
excess of the posted weight limit unless the posting authority has
issued a permit for the vehicle or vehicles in accordance with this
section.
(2) Type of permits. Types of permits shall include the following:
(a) A Type 1 permit authorizes use of a particular posted highway
or portion thereof by an over-posted-weight vehicle. It is valid
only when carried in the over-posted-weight vehicle.
(b) A Type 2 permit authorizes use of a particular posted highway
or portion thereof by any number of over-posted-weight
vehicles being driven to or from a common destination.
[1] Documents of the type set forth in Subsection A(3) of this
section (relating to local traffic) will constitute evidence of
a vehicle's destination.
[2] A Type 2 permit will be issued only upon request of the
permittee and, if the posting authority determines that it is
not feasible to issue a Type 1 permit for each vehicle, for
§ 256-25 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 256-25
1:304
example, most over-posted-weight vehicles hauling to and
from the place of business of the permittee belong to or
are hauling under contract with customers or suppliers of
the permittee.
(c) A Type 3 permit authorizes use of a number of specified posted
highways or portions thereof by an over-posted-weight vehicle.
[1] A Type 3 permit is valid only when carried in the overposted-
weight vehicle.
[2] A Type 3 permit is issued only if the posting authority
determines that damage to the posted highway covered by
the permit will be minimal because of the limited number
of moves by over-posted-weight vehicles and short-term
use of the highways anticipated by the permittee.
(3) Excess maintenance agreement. Issuance of a permit to exceed a
posted weight limit or limits will be conditioned on the agreement
by the permittee to accept financial responsibility for excess
maintenance of the posted highway or portion thereof to be used by
the permittee. The agreement may provide for the work to be
performed by the posting authority or its contractor or by the
permittee or its contractor, except that in the case of self-bonded
agreement, the City will require that all work be performed by the
permittee or its contractor. The bonding agreement shall be
executed after the posting authority and the hauler conduct an onsite
inspection of the posted roadway. During this inspection,
municipal officials and representatives from the hauling company
will complete a detailed report documenting the exact condition of
the road. In many cases, photographs will also be taken to
substantiate the report. Copies of the inspection report and
photographs will be made available to the hauler. A similar
inspection will be made following the hauling activity. In the event
of a disagreement between haulers and the City relative to scope
and extent of damages requiring excess maintenance or the quality
of repair work, the decision of the posting authority will govern.
The City will continue to be responsible for normal maintenance
work.
(4) Security. Except as provided in Subsection B(4)(d) of this section,
the permittee shall be required to provide security in favor of the
posting authority to assure compliance with the maintenance
construction agreement.
(a) Amount of security. Amount of security shall be as follows:
[1] Type 1 and 2 permits. Type 1 and Type 2 permits shall
include:
§ 256-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 256-25
1:305
[a] Six thousand dollars per linear mile for unpaved
highways to be maintained at a level consistent with
the type of highway.
[b] Twelve thousand five hundred dollars per linear mile
for paved highways to be maintained at a level
consistent with the type of highway.
[c] Fifty thousand dollars per linear mile for any highway
which the posting authority allows to be maintained
below a level consistent with the type of highway.
[2] Schedule of bonding amounts. The City will from time to
time, but not more often than annually, publish a revised
schedule of bonding amounts based on increased or
decreased maintenance costs.
(b) Form of security. The security may be in the form of a
performance bond with surety by a company authorized to do
business in the commonwealth; or, at the option of the
permittee, in the form of a certified or cashier's check, or
irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the posting authority; or
in some other form of security acceptable to the posting
authority.
(c) Additional security. When the amount of damage in excess of
normal maintenance to a posted highway is estimated by the
posting authority to constitute 75% or more of the amount of
the security, the posting authority may require the highway to
be maintained or reconstructed within 30 days unless the
permittee agrees to provide such additional security as the
posting authority shall determine.
(d) Self-bonding. The posting authority may authorize self-bonding
if it determines, on the basis of the financial ability of the
permittee, that it is unlikely that the posting authority will be
unable to collect a judgement rendered against the permittee
for failure to comply with the maintenance agreement.
[1] The posting authority may require corporate officers and
stockholders and their spouses to execute a self-bond, if
the financial ability of a corporation is insufficient in itself
to justify self-bonding.
[2] The posting authority may require the permittee to
execute liens on real or personal property, or both, as a
condition for authorizing self-bonding.
[3] In order to be considered for self-bonding by the posting
authority, a permittee shall file a contractor's financial
statement. The financial statement shall be updated
annually, and within 30 days of any request for an update.
§ 256-25 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 256-25
1:306
(5) Multiple permittees. Multiple permittees shall conform with the
following:
(a) Agreement to share excess maintenance responsibility. If two
or more persons wish to obtain Type 1 or Type 2 permits to
operate over-posted-weight vehicles on the same posted
highway or portion thereof, they may agree among themselves
as to their relative responsibility for the cost of themselves as
to their relative responsibility for the cost of excess
maintenance and the posting authority will enter into
agreements and accept security on the basis of the agreed
shares.
(b) Determination by posting authority. If multiple applicants for
Type 1 and Type 2 permits cannot agree on their relative
responsibility, the posting authority will determine their
relative shares, and will enter into agreements with and accept
security from any person agreeing to such determination.
(c) Subsequent permit applicants. Subsection B(5)(a) and (b) of
this subsection shall apply even if one or more persons have
already entered into a Type 1 or Type 2 permit agreement and
posted security when another person expresses the desire to
obtain a Type 1 or Type 2 permit to operate over-posted-weight
vehicles on the same posted highway.
(6) Determination of highway condition. Determination of highway
condition shall consist of the following:
(a) Inspection. Representatives of the posting authority and of the
permittee or permittees will make an on-site inspection of the
posted highway immediately before issuance of each permit in
order to determine its condition.
(b) Reinspection. The posted highway will be reinspected:
[1] Upon issuance of any new permit.
[2] From time to time and the posting authority determines
repairs may be required.
[3] Upon termination of any permit, in order to determine the
amount of damage for which the permittee or permittees
are responsible.
(c) Type 3 permits. Before and after using a Type 3 permit on any
posted highway specified in the permit, the representatives of
the permittee and the posting authority will make an on-site
inspection to determine the relative condition of the highway
before and after the use and to assess any excess maintenance
caused by the permittee.

A person or corporation desiring approval of a plat of a subdivision of
any land lying within the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission shall
submit a written application to the Commission at least 10 days prior to the
A. Regulatory.
(1) Grading; recording deeds. No person, firm or corporation
proposing to make or having made a subdivision within the area of
jurisdiction of these Subdivision Regulations shall proceed with any
grading for roads or alleys before obtaining from the Planning
Commission the approval of the preliminary plat of the proposed
subdivision, and no deeds shall be recorded for lots in any
subdivision, before obtaining from the Commission the approval of
the final plat of the proposed subdivision.
(2) Conformity with master plan. The layout of the proposed
subdivision shall be in general conformity with the Master Plan of
the City.
(3) Access; drainage; geology. No land shall be subdivided for
residential use:
(a) Unless adequate access to the land over adequate streets or
thoroughfares exists or will be provided by the subdivider; or
(b) If such land is considered by the Planning Commission to be
unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or improper
drainage, objectionable earth and rock formation, topography
or any other feature harmful to the health and safety of
possible residents and the community as a whole.
B. Advisory. In order to make the most of the opportunities related to the
subdivision and to conserve time, effort and expense, the owner or
subdivider should consult with the Planning Commission, the Engineer
and other relevant public officials prior to the preparation of the
tentative plan of the subdivision; this informal review should prevent
unnecessary and costly revisions. The Master Plan should be reviewed
to determine how the proposed subdivision will fit into that plan.
Requirements for thoroughfares, school and recreational sites;
shopping centers, community facilities; sanitation, water supply and
drainage and relationship to other developments, existing and
proposed, in the vicinity, should be determined in advance of the
preparation of the subdivision plat. A thorough estimate of the situation

§ 266-41 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 266-42
1:358
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue
collection under this article.

C. Refunds. The Council of the City of Lower Burrell, in consultation with
the Collector and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing
of refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for
exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the
general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest
on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or
75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for
the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be
subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1: The Council of the City of Lower
Burrell or the Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and
provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,

subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.

from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
§ 266-42 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 266-43
1:360
§ 266-44. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 266-45. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 266-46. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind

the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivisions shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or plates of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of this article and
this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this
article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

§ 266-47. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.

All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed

for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 266-49. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer of self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the

subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such

consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998
(municipalities may detail their appeal processes).
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.

days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with

date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the

ARTICLE III
Conservancy Districts
§ 300-23. Purposes.
Districts designated as Conservancy Districts are primarily tracts of open
land which present limitations (including flooding, slopes in excess of 24%
and highway restrictions) to development. The specific purposes of each of
the conservancy districts are as follows:
§ 300-24. Permitted uses.
A. The S-1 Noncommercialized Conservancy District permits publicly
owned and nonprofit clubs and institutions to own, operate and
maintain those public service and recreation facilities indicated for the
S-2 District. This land, due to its limited capability for intensive
development, should be preserved as near to its natural state as
possible. However, large tracts may still be considered for subdivision
or development if disturbance is limited to the less severe areas of the
tract after considering the specific site limitations.
B. In the review of proposed development in Conservancy Districts,
special attention shall be given to the approval of a site plan. This is to
assure sensitive use within the site considered and as it relates to
contiguous properties. Particular effort should be made to safeguard
steep slopes as permanent greenbelts, landscape frames and buffers.
(See Articles VII and VIII.)
C. Future development will be considered only when all proposed
structures are erected with supporting structures appropriate to the
land limitations. Provisions for safe and sanitary sewage disposal and
water supply that comply with city and state requirements will be
mandatory.
A. S-1 and S-2 Districts:
(1) Accessory uses. (See §§ 300-27B and 300-95.)

ARTICLE VIII
Planned Residential Development
§ 300-58. Purpose and intent.
§ 300-59. Application.
Planned residential developments may be permitted in S-1 and S-2
Conservancy Districts and in R-1, R-2 and R-3 Residential Zoning Districts
in the City, subject to the restrictions, qualifications and requirements cited
in this article, as enumerated herein below. Provisions of this chapter and
Chapter 260, Subdivision and Land Development, concerned with dwelling
type, bulk, density and open space shall not be applied except for the single
family portions of a PRD, when planned residential development proposals
are reviewed and approved and except when specifically indicated by the
provisions contained in this article. Planned residential developments shall
be shown on Official Zoning Map after being given tentative approval and
certified by Council.
§ 300-60. Ownership requirements.
A. The text and provisions of this article are herein included as they
pertain to residential development according to the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as amended.180
B. The regulations set forth in this article are adopted to encourage
residential development design patterns which are more creative and
imaginative than is generally possible under conventional zoning
district controls and subdivision requirements. The use of the planned
residential development concept should be given favorable
consideration in cases where a rigid pattern of development would
create substantial difficulties in the installation and servicing of utilities
or roads and destroy natural site amenities. The flexibility afforded by
these provisions should preserve or create physical and economic
amenities that will be a continuing asset to the community and permit
the City to acquire open land in a manner heretofore not possible. For
example, flexibility would provide a mechanism for encouraging
dedication of land for parks and permitting the preservation of
contiguous steep slope areas.
A. The minimum land area for a planned residential development (PRD)
shall be 10 continuous acres.
B. The applicant for a PRD plan approval shall evidence a full ownership
interest in the land. The evidence shall be either legal title or an
executed binding sales agreement.
C. The project shall be in single, legal as well as equitable, ownership prior
to approval of the final development plan.
180. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 300-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-60
1:451
§ 300-61. Availability of public services and access.
D. A parcel to be developed must be one contiguous piece of land not
separated into subparcels by a public highway, road or a railroad rightof-
way.
A. In any instance where public or municipal sewer and water facilities are
available and are capable of being extended to the development site,
the developer shall connect the project to such facilities. Any extension
of the sewer system and collector lines (not laterals) must become a
public system, constructed in accordance with the sewage manual
procedures and requirements, with inspection by and approved by the
Lower Burrell Municipal Authority. If the cost of the connector facility
or line is more than the cost for the installation of an interim treatment
facility, the developer shall not be required to connect to the municipal
system. [Amended 9-10-2012 by Ord. No. 1-2012]
B. In the absence of public sewerage facilities, the developer shall provide
within a planned unit, a sanitary sewer system which shall be subject to
the standards and rules and regulations of the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Department of Environmental Protection of
the Commonwealth and of the rules and regulations and standards of
the City.181
C. Central water service shall be supplied to each structure to be erected
in the development subject to the above-mentioned provisions as well
as any other requirements of the federal or state government. A fire
hydrant shall be provided within 600 feet of each structure.
D. The developer shall provide within the planned residential development
a storm drainage system which shall be of sufficient size and design to
collect, carry off and dispose of all predictable surface water runoff
within the development, and shall be so constructed as to conform with
the statutes, ordinances and regulations of the commonwealth and the
City. The adequacy of such facilities shall be determined by the City
Engineer.
E. All PRDs shall be related to the local and regional highway systems. The
developer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission, the City Engineer and appropriate officials of the State
Department of Transportation that traffic circulation will not be
adversely influenced, that additional traffic hazards will not be created
and that public and private road systems are adequate in terms of
traffic volume capacity and construction type to accommodate the
projected PRD-generated traffic.
F. Access to all PRDs shall not be through or over streets of existing
single-family developments, but must have direct access from arterial
or collector roads as defined.

§ 300-62. Administration and procedures.
G. Collector lines/branches (not laterals), or whatever vernacular term is
applied to them (e.g., multiple laterals connected to a private sanitary
sewage collection line, which is then tapped into the public sanitary
sewage collection facilities), are not permitted. Each residential unit
must be individually tapped into the public sanitary sewage facilities.
See Exhibit 1 attached hereto and incorporated by reference.182 This
does not apply to high-rise buildings or garden apartment style
buildings or whatever vernacular term is applied to them. [Added

A. The planned residential development provision of this chapter shall be
administered by the Planning Commission, which shall review all
applications on the basis of specified standards, conditions, regulations
and procedures. The Planning Commission shall conduct public
hearings and have final authority to approve, modify or disapprove
development plans.
B. The developer shall obtain required approvals for planned residential
developments by following a four step review process which shall
consist of:
(1) A preapplication conference.
(2) A preliminary development plan.
(3) Public hearings and approvals.
(4) A final development plan.
C. Preapplication conference with Planning Commission.
(1) Each applicant shall schedule a preapplication conference at a
regular meeting of the Planning Commission to obtain information,
exchange of ideas and feedback. It shall be the responsibility of the
City Building Inspector to arrange the mandatory conference with
the Planning Commission and other officials who should be
participants. The conference shall include members or a
designated committee of the Planning Commission and the City
Engineer, and such other representatives as deemed appropriate to
be included in the preapplication conference.
(2) No formal requirement for plan or material submission is
established for the preapplication conference; however, the more
data the applicant presents in the form of sketch plans, land use
concepts, density ranges proposed, ancillary use proposals, site
information, existing perimeter conditions, access considerations
and utility needs, the more guidance and help can be offered in
preparing an acceptable plan for local approval.

§ 300-63. Formal application and tentative approval proceedings.
(3) The general intent of the proposal, evidenced schematically by
sketch plans and other basic illustrative materials, are to be
considered before submission of the planned residential
development application. It is the intent of this chapter that
subdivision review where applicable to a PRD and according to
Chapter 260, Subdivision of Land, be carried out simultaneously
with the review of a planned residential development under this
section of this article.
(4) This early review is to discourage developers from committing
substantial resources to a PRD until the preapplication conference
is completed, and to also expedite the formal review procedure and
assist in completing the application.
A. Following the preapplication conference(s), the developer shall provide
the Planning Commission with an application for tentative approval and
five copies of the overall preliminary site plan adhering to the standards
and requirements of this chapter. The application shall be placed on the
Planning Commission agenda to initiate the formal tentative approval
review proceedings. The applicant shall submit with the preliminary
plan an explanation of the character of the planned residential
development, the reasons why a planned residential development
would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan for the development of the City.
B. The preliminary development plan shall be presented in sufficient detail
to provide the Planning Commission with a major substantive review of
the proposed planned residential development.
C. A statement of the applicant's intentions with regard to the future
selling or leasing of all or portions of the PRD, such as land areas,
dwelling units, etc., shall be included.
D. The preliminary development plan shall also include a key map of the
location of the site. The overall site plan shall be at a scale no smaller
than one inch equals 100 feet and any maps necessary to show the
major details of the proposed PRD shall contain the following minimum
information:
(1) The existing site conditions including contours at a minimum
interval of two feet up to 10% slope and a minimum interval of five
feet for over 10% slope, watercourses, floodplains, unique natural
features, and forest cover and other natural vegetation considered
significant by the Planning Commission and City Engineer.183
(2) Proposed lot lines and plot designs.

§ 300-62 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 300-63
1:454
(3) The location and floor area size of all existing and proposed
buildings, structures and other improvements, including maximum
heights, types of dwelling units by code, density per type, and
nonresidential structures, including commercial facilities. All
structures shall be distinguished and identified on the plan by code.
Preliminary evaluations and/or architectural renderings of typical
structures and improvements shall be provided. Such drawings
shall be sufficient to relay the basic architectural intent of the
proposed improvements but should not be encumbered with final
detail at this stage.
(4) The location and size in acres or square feet of all areas to be
conveyed, dedicated or reserved as common open spaces, public
parks, recreational areas, school sites and similar public and
semipublic uses.
(5) The existing and proposed circulation system of arterial, collector
and local streets including off-street parking areas, service areas,
loading areas, and major points of access to public rights-of-way,
including major points of ingress and egress to the development.
Notations of proposed ownership, public or private, should be
included where appropriate. (Detailed engineering drawings of
cross sections and street standards shall be handled in the final
development plan stage.)
(6) The existing and proposed pedestrian circulation system, including
its interrelationships with the vehicular circulation system,
indicating proposed treatments of points of conflict.
(7) The existing and proposed utility systems including sanitary
sewers, storm sewers, and water, electric, gas and telephone lines.
(8) A general landscape plan indicating the treatment of materials
used for private and common open spaces. (The landscape plan
should be in general schematic form at this stage.)
(9) Enough information on land areas adjacent to the proposed PRD to
indicate the relationships between the proposed development and
existing and proposed adjacent areas, including land uses, zoning
classifications, densities, circulation systems, public facilities, and
unique natural features of the landscape.
(10) The proposed treatment of the perimeter of the PRD, including
materials and techniques used such as screens, fences and walls.
(11) Any additional information as required by the Planning
Commission necessary to evaluate the character and impact of the
proposed PRD.
E. Projected scheduling of phases. In the case of development plans which
call for development over a period of years, a schedule shall be
provided showing the proposed times within which applications for final
§ 300-63 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-63
1:455
§ 300-64. Public hearings.185
approval of all sections of the PRD are intended to be filed. This
schedule shall be reviewed annually with the Planning Commission by
the developer on the anniversary of the tentative approval, until the
development is completed and accepted. It shall be the obligation of
the developer to request such reviews in writing within the thirty-day
period prior to the anniversary date of the tentative approval.184
A. Within 60 days after the filing of an application for tentative approval of
a planned residential development pursuant to this chapter, a public
hearing pursuant to public notice on said application shall be held by
the Planning Commission.
B. Public notice shall be given and written notice shall be given to the
applicant, the Zoning Officer and to any person who has made timely
request for the same. Written notices shall be given at such time and in
such manner as shall be prescribed by rules of the Planning
Commission. In addition to the written notice provided herein, written
notice of said hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected
tract of land at least one week prior to the hearing.
C. The parties to the hearing shall be the City, any person affected by the
application who has made timely appearance of record before the
Planning Commission, and any other person including civic or
community organizations permitted to appear by the Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission shall have power to require that
all persons who wish to be considered parties enter appearances in
writing on forms provided by the Planning Commission for that
purpose.
D. The Chairman, or Acting Chairman, in the absence of the Chairman, of
the Planning Commission shall have power to administer oaths and
issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the
production of relevant documents and papers, including witnesses and
documents requested by the parties.
E. The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and shall
be afforded the opportunity to respond and present evidence and
argument and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant issues.
F. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial, or
unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
G. The Planning Commission shall keep a stenographic record of the
proceedings. The appearance fee for a stenographer shall be shared
equally by the applicant and the Planning Commission. The cost of the

original transcript shall be paid by the Planning Commission if the
transcript is ordered by the Planning Commission or shall be paid by
the person appealing from the decision of the Planning Commission if
such appeal is made, and in either event, the cost of additional copies
shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other
cases, the party requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost
thereof.
H. The Planning Commission shall not communicate, directly or indirectly,
with any party or his representatives in connection with any issue
involved except upon notice for all parties to participate, shall not take
notice of any communication, reports, staff memoranda or other
materials, except advice from their solicitor, unless the parties are
afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed and shall not
inspect the site or its surroundings after the commencement of
hearings with any party or his representative unless all parties are
given an opportunity to be present.
I. The Planning Commission may continue the hearing from time to time;
provided, however, that in any event, the public hearing or hearings
shall be concluded within 60 days after the date of the first public
hearing.
A. The Planning Commission, within 60 days following the conclusion of
the public hearing shall, by official written communication to the
landowner, either:
(1) Grant tentative approval of the development plan as submitted;
(2) Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not
included in the development plan as submitted; or
(3) Deny tentative approval to the development plan.
B. Failure to so act with said sixty-day period shall be deemed to be a grant
of tentative approval of the development plan as submitted. In the
event, however, that tentative approval is granted subject to conditions,
the landowner may, within 30 days after receiving a copy of the official
written communication of the Planning Commission, notify such
Planning Commission of his refusal to accept all said conditions, in
which case, the Planning Commission shall be deemed to have denied
tentative approval of the development plan. In the event the landowner
does not, within said period, notify the Planning Commission of his
refusal to accept all said conditions, tentative approval of the
development plan, with all said conditions, shall stand as granted.
C. The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of
186. Editor's Note: Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 300-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-65
1:457
fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons
for the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said
communication shall set forth with particularity in what respects the
development plan would or would not be in the public interest
including, but not limited to, findings of fact and conclusions on the
following:
(1) In those respects in which the development plan is or is not
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of the
City;
(2) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject
property including, but not limited to, density, bulk and use, and
the reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be in the
public interest;
(3) The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the
planned residential development, the reliability of the proposals for
maintenance and conservation of the common open space, and the
adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common
open space as related to the proposed density and type of
residential development;
(4) The physical design of the development plan and the manner in
which said design does or does not make adequate provision for
public services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, and
further the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual
enjoyment;
(5) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned
residential development to the neighborhood in which it is
proposed to be established; and
(6) In the case of a development plan which proposes development
over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions
intended to protect the interests of the public and of the residents
of the planned residential development in the integrity of the
development plan.
D. In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or
without conditions, the Planning Commission may set forth in the
official written communication the time within which an application for
final approval of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of
development plan which provides for development over a period of
years, the periods of time within which applications for final approval of
each part thereof shall be filed. Except upon the consent of the
landowner, the time so established between grant of tentative approval
and an application for final approval shall not be less than three months
and, in the case of development over a period of years, the time
between applications for final approval of each part of a plan shall be
not less than 12 months.

§ 300-66. Status of plan after tentative approval.187
§ 300-67. Application for final plan approval.
After the preliminary development plan is granted tentative approval by
the Planning Commission, the developer shall thereafter submit detailed
plans for any part or section of the land for which he desires approval.
The Planning Commission shall review the detailed plans to determine if
they comply with this section and with the overall plan originally submitted
by the developer. No zoning or building permit shall be issued until after
approval by the Planning Commission of the detailed plans for the section in
which the proposed development is located. Approval of any detailed plans
shall lapse unless more than token construction is started in that section
within one year. No legal or equitable conveyance of land or buildings within
the development may be made until the developer has complied with all
applicable City ordinances.
A. The official written communication shall be certified by the City Clerk
and shall be filed in his office, and a certified copy shall be mailed to the
landowner. Where tentative approval has been granted, it shall be
deemed an amendment to the Zoning Map, effective upon final
approval, and shall be noted on the Zoning Map.
B. Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of the
planned residential development for recording nor authorize
development or the issuance of any building permits. A development
plan which has been given tentative approval as submitted, to which
has been given tentative approval with conditions which have been
accepted by the landowner (and provided that the landowner has not
defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the tentative approval),
shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by the action of
the City pending an application or applications for final approval,
without the consent of the landowner, provided an application or
applications for final approval is filed or, in the case of development
over a period of years, provided applications are filed, within the
periods of time specified in the official written communication granting
tentative approval.
C. In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval and
thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect to
abandon said development plan and shall so notify the Planning
Commission in writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to file
application or applications for final approval within the required period
of time or times, as the case may be, the tentative approval shall be
deemed to be revoked and all that portion of the area included in the
development plan for which final approval has not been given shall be
subject to those ordinances otherwise applicable thereto as they may be
amended from time to time, and the same shall be noted on the Zoning
Map and in the records of the City Clerk.

§ 300-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-67
1:459
A. In the event the application for final approval has been filed, together
with all drawings, specifications and other documents in support
thereof, and as required by the official written communication of
tentative approval, the Planning Commission shall, within 30 days of
such filing, grant such development plan final approval.
B. The final development plan shall be deemed in substantial compliance
with the preliminary development plan, provided modification by the
applicant does not involve a change of one or more of the following:
(1) Violate any provision of this article.
(2) Vary the lot area requirement by more than 10% the amount
specified on the approved preliminary development plan.
(3) Involve a reduction of more than 10% of the area reserved for the
common open space and/or usable open space as specified on the
approved preliminary development plan.
(4) Increase the floor area proposed for nonresidential use by more
than 10% the area specified on the approved preliminary
development plan.
(5) Increase the total ground area covered by buildings by more than
5% of the amount specified on the approved preliminary
development plan.
C. Minor changes in the location, siting and height of buildings and
structures may be authorized by the Planning Commission without
additional public hearings if required by engineering or other
circumstances not foreseen at the time the final plan was approved. No
change authorized by this subsection may cause any of the following:
(1) A change in the use or character of the development.
(2) An increase in overall coverage of structures.
(3) An increase in the intensity of use.
(4) An increase in the problems of traffic circulation and public
utilities.
(5) A reduction in approved open space.
(6) A reduction of off-street parking and loading space.
(7) A reduction in required pavement widths.
D. In the event the development plan, as submitted, contains variations
from the development plan given tentative approval, the Planning
Commission may refuse to grant final approval and shall within 30 days
from the filing of the application for final approval so advise the
landowner in writing of such refusal, setting forth in such notice the
§ 300-67 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 300-67
1:460
reasons why one or more of such variations are not in the public
interest. In the event of such refusal, the landowner may either:
(1) Refile his application for final approval without the variations
objected; or
(2) File a written request with the Planning Commission that they hold
a public hearing on this application for final approval. If the
landowner wishes to take either such alternate action he may do so
at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final
approval, or within 30 additional days if the time for applying for
final approval has already passed at the time when the landowner
was advised that the development plan was not in substantial
compliance. In the event the landowner fails to take either of these
alternate actions within such time, he shall be deemed to have
abandoned the development plan. Any such public hearing shall be
held pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for the
hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing shall be
conducted in the manner prescribed in this article for public
hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days
after the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning Commission shall
by official written communication either grant final approval to the
development plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial of
final approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising under
this section, be in compliance with the provisions of Act 247,
§ 709.188
E. A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by Council and shall be filed
of record forthwith in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds before
any development takes place in accordance therewith. Unless the
development plan or part thereof is so recorded, no construction shall
commence on the project site. Upon the filing of record of the
development plan, the zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise
applicable to the land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto.
Pending completion within a reasonable time of such planned
residential development or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that
has been finally approved, no modifications of the provisions of such
development plan, or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made
except with the consent of the landowner.
F. In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given final
approval and thereafter the landowner abandons such plan or the
section thereof that has been finally approved, and so notifies the
Planning Commission in writing; or, in the event the landowner fails to
commence and carry out the planned development within the schedule
projected and approved in the application for tentative approval, or
such amendment as subsequently mutually agreed to by the landowner

and the Planning Commission, no development or further development
shall take place on the property included in the development plan.
G. If the sequence of construction of various portions of the development
is to occur in stages, then the open space and/or recreational facilities
shall be developed, or committed thereto, in proportion to the number
of dwelling units intended to be developed during any given stage of
construction as approved by the Planning Commission. Furthermore, at
no time during the construction of the project shall the number of
constructed dwelling units per acre of developed land exceed the
overall density per acre established by the approved final development
plan.

(1) The Planning Commission reserves the right to reduce density
levels in any proposed planned residential development if it
determines that:
(a) There is inconvenient or inadequate vehicular access to the
development.
(b) Serious traffic congestion on adjoining streets will be
generated.
(c) An excessive burden will be placed upon the ability of
responsible public agencies to provide needed public facilities
to serve the proposed development.
B. Lot and structure requirements.
(1) Lot size. There shall be no minimum lot size, setbacks, percentage
of lot coverage or lot width. However, every single-family dwelling
shall have access to a public street, court, walk or other area
dedicated to public use. No structure or group of structures shall
be erected within 20 feet of any other structure or group of
structures.
(2) Setback. All structures on the perimeter of the development must
be set back in accordance with the provisions of the zoning district
controlling the area within which the development is situated.

(3) Height. There shall be no maximum height requirements.
(4) Length. There shall be no continuous structure of townhouses
containing more than six dwelling units.
(5) Location of structures. The proposed location and arrangement of
structures shall not be detrimental to existing or prospective
adjacent structures or to existing or prospective development of
the neighborhood.
C. Open space. [See Act 247, Article I, § 107(4), Common Open Space.189]
Area limitations for various uses. Within a planned residential
development, the following percentages of the total gross land area
shall be devoted to specified uses as indicated herewith:
(1) A maximum of 80% for residential use; land devoted to residential
use shall be deemed to include those streets, alleys, parking areas,
private open spaces and courts which abut and service primarily
residences or groups of residences.
(2) A maximum of 8% for accessory retail, dining and service facilities
and parking associated with these uses.
(3) A minimum of 15% for open-air recreational uses, which may
include steep slopes, and other usable open space, but this open
space shall not include usable open space which is available for use
by the general public or by persons who do not reside in the
residences or groups of residences in proximity to it.
(4) Usable open space shall not include space devoted to streets and
parking. Usable open space shall be defined as an open area
(natural or graded) set aside and developed for use by the
occupants of the development for recreation, parks, courts,
gardens or household service activities such as clothes drying,
which space is effectively separated from automobile traffic and
parking and is readily accessible to the residents. The buildings,
structures and improvements which are permitted in the common
open space must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized
for the common open space and must conserve and enhance the
amenities of the common open space having regard to its
topography and unimproved condition. Recreation facilities or
structures and their accessory uses located in common recreation
areas shall be considered open space as long as total impervious
surfaces (paving, roofs, etc.) constitute no more than 5% of the
total open space. Landscaped roof areas devoted to recreational or
leisure-time activities, freely accessible to residents, may be
counted as open space at the option of the Planning Commission at
a value of 50% of actual roof area devoted to these uses.

(5) A minimum of 5% for passive or undisturbed open space such as
sloped lands, watercourses or wooded lands. Where significant or
unique natural amenities exist on the site, the Planning
Commission shall have the authority to enforce their preservation.
These may include, but are not limited to, features such as rock
outcroppings, groves of trees, ravines, ponds and stream beds.
(6) Protection of open spaces. Open spaces between structures,
including those spaces being used as public or private recreational
areas, shall be protected by adequate covenants running with the
land or by conveyances or dedications. Planned residential
developments shall be approved subject to the submission of a legal
instrument or instruments setting forth a plan or manner of
permanent care and maintenance of such open spaces, recreational
areas and communally owned facilities. No such instrument shall
be acceptable until approved by the City Solicitor as to legal form
and effect, and the Planning Commission as to suitability for the
proposed use of the open areas. In cases where the City will not be
accepting dedications of streets, recreation areas or open spaces,
the landowner shall provide for an organization or trust for
ownership and maintenance. If the common open space is deeded
to a homeowners' association or a nonprofit corporation
established on a membership basis, the developer shall file a
declaration of covenants and restrictions that will govern the
association, to be submitted with the application for the
preliminary approval. If there is a homeowners' association under
the Uniform Condominium Act,190 the developer must file a
declaration of rules and regulations. The provisions shall include,
but not be limited to, the following:191
(a) The homeowners' association or nonprofit corporation must be
set up before the homes are sold.
(b) Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any
successive buyer.
(c) The open space restrictions must be permanent, not just for a
period of years.
(d) The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes and the maintenance of recreational and other
facilities.
(e) Homeowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost; the
assessment levied by the association can become a lien on the
property.
(f) The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.

1:464
(7) The City may, at any time and from time to time, accept the
dedication of land or any interest therein for public use and
maintenance, but the City need not require, as a condition of the
approval of a planned residential development, that land proposed
to be set aside for common open space be dedicated or made
available to public use [see Act 247, Article VII, § 705(d)(1)192]. In
the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any
time after establishment of the planned residential development
fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the development plan, the City may
serve written notice upon such organization or upon the residents
of the planned residential development setting forth the manner in
which the organization has failed to maintain the common open
space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within
30 days thereof, and shall state the date and place of hearing
thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At such
hearing, the City may modify the terms of the original notice as to
the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which
they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set forth in the original
notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be corrected within
such 30 days or any extension thereof, the City in order to preserve
the taxable values of the properties within the planned residential
development and to prevent the common open space from
becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon such common open
space, and maintain the same for a period of one year. Such
maintenance by the City shall not constitute a taking of such
common open space, nor vest in the public any rights to use the
same. Before the expiration of such year, the City shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore
responsible for the maintenance of the common open space, call a
public hearing upon notice to such organization, or to the residents
of the planned residential development shall show cause why such
maintenance by the City shall not, at the option of the City, continue
for a succeeding year. If Council determines that such organization
is ready and able to maintain such common open space during the
next succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing and
determination, in each year thereafter. The decision of Council
shall be subject to appeal to court in the same manner, and within
the same time limitation, as is provided for zoning appeals by the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 of 1968, as
amended.193 The cost of such maintenance by the City shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the planned
residential development that have a right of enjoyment of the
common open space, and shall become a lien on such properties.
192. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10705(d)(1).
193. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 300-68 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-68

The City, at the time of entering upon such common open space for
purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of lien in the office of the
Prothonotary of the County upon the properties affected by the lien
within the planned residential development.

(2) A pedestrian and bicycle circulation system shall be established to
serve all elements within the development. The pedestrian and
bicycle circulation system shall be reasonably segregated from
vehicular traffic to provide separation of vehicular and pedestrian
movement.
(3) Streets in a planned residential development may be dedicated to
public use or may be retained under private ownership. Council
may modify specifications otherwise applicable for street standards
where it finds that the standards are not required in the interest of
the residents of the PRD and that modifications of the standards as
proposed will be consistent with the interests of the entire City.
G. Landscaping.
(1) A general landscaping plan shall be required at the time of the
original submission, to be followed by a detailed landscaping plan
prior to final approvals. The detailed plan shall show the spacing,
sizes and specific types of landscaping materials.
(2) Existing trees shall be preserved whenever possible. The location
of trees shall be considered when planning the site elements such

I. Water supply. If water is to be provided by means other than by private
wells owned and maintained by the individual owners of lots within the
planned residential development, applicants shall present evidence to
the Planning Commission that the planned residential development is to
be supplied by a certified public utility, a bona fide cooperative
association of lot owners, or by a municipal corporation, authority or
utility. A copy of a Certificate of Public Convenience from the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or an application for such

1:468
A. After general construction commences, the City Building Inspector
shall review, at least once every six months, all building permits issued
and compare them to the overall development phasing program. If he
determines that the rate of construction of residential units or
nonresidential structures substantially differs from the phasing
program, he shall so notify the developer and the Planning Commission
in writing; thereafter, the Planning Commission may issue such orders
to the developer as it sees it, and upon continued violation of this
subsection, may suspend the developer from further construction of
dwelling units of nonresidential structures until compliance is achieved.
B. Council shall require a performance bond be furnished and filed with
the City for private improvements. An escrow agreement and account
approved by the City Solicitor as to form and content shall be required
in the amount of 110% of the estimated construction cost and
engineering for each phase of development. These funds may be
dispersed upon certification by the Project Engineer and by the City
acting through the City Engineer. Such escrow shall accompany the
request for final approval to insure completion of all public site
improvements, streets, parking areas, sewers, utilities, landscaping,
plantings and screening.195
C. Before any building permit may be issued in the planned development,
all agreements, contracts, deed restrictions and sureties shall be in

facilities and functions not to be a responsibility of the City and
performed at general City expense may take any form acceptable to
the City, but shall include agreement that if operation and
maintenance of such areas, facilities and functions is not continued
as set forth in the final plan and report, the City may, in addition to
other remedies, operate and maintain such areas, facilities and
functions in the manner required in the final plan and report, with
costs assessed ratably against properties within the development
having right of use of such areas, facilities and services, and such
costs shall become a lien on such properties.
D. In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof is given final
approval and thereafter the landowner abandons such plan or the
section thereof that has been finally approved, and so notifies the
Planning Commission in writing; or, in the event the landowner fails to
commence and carry out the planned residential development within

being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the City, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all
court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the City as a
result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the City may enforce the judgment pursuant to
the appropriate rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the Magisterial
District Judge determining that there has been a violation, further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership
or corporation violating these provisions to have believed that there
was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have
been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge, and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees
collected for the violation of planned residential development
provisions of this chapter shall be paid over to the City.
B. The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final

comply with the following requirements:
A. Accessory use as a principal use. The Zoning Hearing Board may
consider an accessory use as a principal use for the owner of a dwelling

parking area for parking of noncommercial vehicles by residents of a
neighborhood, on a lot having a buildable area of not less than 350 square

circumstances are such that the combination of such lot, with other
adjacent property to form one or more zoning lots cannot reasonably be
expected, and that otherwise the provisions of this chapter would be
confiscatory.
F. Other reasonable conditions are established to protect the amenities of
surrounding properties, as determined in each instance by the Board.

a buildable area of not less than 350 square feet for each vehicle stored;
provided, the prescribed yard, lot width and height requirements are
met; and provided further that the Zoning Hearing Board determines

Signs
§ 300-102. Compliance and intent.
No sign, billboard or exterior graphic display shall be permitted in any
district except as herein provided. No sign other than for permitted uses
shall be allowed. Signs and their graphics can effectively express the
character of an establishment or a community and for that reason it is the
intent of this section to encourage owners and/or tenants to consider all
signage as it relates to the overall community image and compatibility with
the architecture of the structure and neighboring buildings.
§ 300-103. Sign permit required.
The alteration, erection, replacement or moving of a sign shall require
a sign permit. Alteration shall include any change in the type of use

announcing the name, address and/or professional activity of the occupant
of the premises on which such sign is located. A sign perpendicular to and
outside right-of-way may be six square feet in surface size on each side.
Such sign shall not overhang any sidewalk, but any sign shall be set back
at least 10 feet in a C or M District, 30 feet in all other districts, from
any right-of-way line or greater as may be necessary in the opinion of the
Zoning Officer and Police Department to eliminate any obstruction to traffic
visibility. (See §§ 300-111 and 300-113.) Permission for larger signs may be
obtained from the Planning Commission or Zoning Hearing Board.
§ 300-106. Signs not exceeding 12 or 24 square feet.
A sign or bulletin board not exceeding 12 square feet in any S, R-1 and R-2

abuts.
§ 300-107. Street right-of-way; intersection unobstructed.
No signs in any zoning district shall be installed or replaced within the
established street right-of-way line of any street or highway. When erected
on any property at an intersection of streets or highways, signs may be
placed in a required front yard, provided no portion of the sign extends over
a sidewalk area, but signs shall be set back at least 10 feet in a C or M
District, 30 feet in all other districts, from any right-of-way line or such a
greater distance as may be necessary in the opinion of the Zoning Officer
and Police Department to eliminate any obstruction to traffic visibility. (See
§§ 300-111 and 300-113.)
§ 300-108. Interior designers; contractor signs.
Signs advertising the installation of interior furnishings or other equipment
upon existing residential premises are permitted, as are temporary signs of
carpenters, plumbers, painters, contractors, builders and other artisans or
craftsmen, provided that the surface size of any one side does not exceed
12 square feet. Such signs are permitted on the premises where the work is
being performed and only during the period in which such work is going on.

regulations of the zoning district in which it is located may be restored
if damaged or partially destroyed by fire, flood, wind or other calamity
or Act of God, in the same location, not exceeding the same height, and
for the same use as it was before the occurrence.
A. Building height in excess of the height above average ground level
allowed in any zoning district may be permitted, provided all front, side
and rear yard depths are increased beyond the minimum required, one
foot for each additional foot of height.
B. The following structures are exempt from height regulations, provided
it is demonstrated to the Board that they require such height
exemptions as are necessary and essential for proper function and they
do not constitute a hazard to an established airport or adjacent
development: television and radio towers and spires, belfries,
monuments, tanks, water and fire towers and scenery lofts, cooling
towers, ornamental towers and spires, chimneys, elevator bulkheads,
smokestacks, conveyors and steeples.

Nonconforming Uses and Structures
§ 300-138. Intent and purpose.
§ 300-139. Annexed areas; contested uses.
§ 300-140. Nonconforming uses of land.
The lawful use of land or structures thereon existing at the time of the
enactment of this chapter, or of an amendment thereto, not involving any
principal and/or accessory structure, although such use does not conform
to the provisions of this chapter, may be continued, provided that no such
nonconforming use of land shall be in any way be expanded, extended or
moved in whole or in part to any other lot of record or other portion of
the lot of record. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure
A. Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that
may later be adopted, there may exist structures, and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this chapter or future amendment.
B. Although such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved, it is the intent of this
chapter to permit such nonconformities to continue until they are
removed. It is further the intent of this chapter that existing
nonconformities shall not be used as justification for adding other
structures or uses prohibited in the same district.
A. Annexed areas. All land annexed to the City after the effective date of
this chapter shall be classified automatically as being in an S or
Conservancy District. The Planning Commission shall recommend to
the Zoning Hearing Board appropriate zoning for the annexed area
within not more than six months after the effective date of annexation.
However, until Council has adopted a zoning district for the annexed
area, the provisions of § 300-141C relative to nonconformity
termination, shall not apply to such annexed area.
B. Contested uses, areas and heights. All uses, areas and heights which
require interpretation due to conflicting definitions or requirements in
this chapter may be permitted or excluded under the maximum or more
exclusive requirements and may be considered as nonconforming by
the Board until such time as an interpretation is secured from the
proper authority. Amendments in this chapter based on the maximum
requirements shall control on an interim basis without amendment for
successive six-month periods after adoption of this chapter at which
time all amendments as applicable, shall be submitted to Council for
approval. Amendments may be requested by the Board if the Board
feels such are warranted at an earlier date.

and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
§ 300-141. Nonconforming uses of structures.
The lawful use of a structure existing at the time of the enactment of this
chapter or of an amendment thereto, although such use does not conform
to the provision of this article, may be continued and such use may be
extended throughout the building; provided, that such extension of use does
not displace a use conforming to the zoning district designated by this
article, but not in violation of the area, height and yard requirements of the
zoning district in which such structure or premises is located.
§ 300-142. Nonconforming structures; mobile homes.
A. In any zoning district, a lawful nonconforming use may be changed to a
permitted use or a special exception for that zoning district, provided
no structural alterations to the exterior are made other than those
ordered by the Zoning Officer to assure the safety of the structure to
those persons necessary to convert the structure to a conforming use as
designated by this chapter.
B. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which the structure
is located; and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
C. Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure or land, or a portion
thereof, has been discontinued for a period of one year, it shall not
again be used except in conformity with the regulations of the zoning
district in which such structure is located.
D. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure and premises may be changed to another nonconforming use;
provided, that the Board, either by general rule or by making findings in
the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate
or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board may require appropriate
conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this article.
A. A structure or part of a structure lawfully existing at the time of the
enactment of this chapter, or of an amendment thereto, although such
structure does not conform to the lot and yard requirements of this
chapter, may be continued in use, provided no structural alterations are
made to the nonconforming portion of the structure other than those
ordered by the Zoning Officer to assure the safety of the structure.
B. Such nonconforming structures include, but are not limited to,
nonconforming signs and mobile homes. The nonconforming use of a
property for a mobile home may be continued, provided there is no
change in ownership other than to a direct heir of such mobile home, no

expansion or extension of such use, no additions of service utilities
and no new foundation constructed. Whenever the nonconforming use
of property for a mobile home has been discontinued for a period of
at least one year, the use shall not thereafter be reestablished. (See
§ 300-140).
C. A nonconforming structure which is nonconforming only because of
failure to provide required automobile parking and off-street loading
space shall have all the rights of a conforming use and structure. This
provision, however, shall not be deemed to remove the obligation to
provide required automobile parking and off-street loading space for
the enlarged or changed portion of the use or structure at the time of
such enlargement or change.235
A. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of
60% or more of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not
be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. If so damaged to a greater extent, any new structure and its
use shall conform to all requirements of this chapter, except that if a
single-family residence located in any zoning district is damaged or
destroyed, it may be reconstructed if such construction is performed
within 12 months of such casualty.
B. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of
less than 60% of its replacement cost at time of destruction, a permit
for its reconstruction shall be issued, provided application for a permit
for such reconstruction is made within one year from the date of such
destruction, and if the restored structure covers no greater area and
contains no greater cubic content than before such casualty.
A. Duration. The Zoning Officer shall certify the existence of the
nonconforming use, which may continue for 20 years from the date of

§ 300-146. Uses under special exception provisions.
Any use for which a special exception permit is granted in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but
shall, without further action, be deemed a conforming use in such zoning
district. Any use lawfully in existence on the effective date of this chapter
which is located in a zoning district in which such use may be permitted as
a special exception shall be considered a special exception and shall have
the same rights and privileges of continuance, maintenance, enlargement
and expansion that are permitted for a conforming use in the same zoning
district; however, no accessory use shall be added or enlarged on a zoning
lot where the principal use is itself a nonconforming use. (See § 300-128).
§ 300-147. Limited enlargement.
The extension of a nonconforming use or structure due to the normal
growth of business shall be permitted. In any zoning district, the
enlargement of a nonconforming commercial or industrial use or structure
shall be restricted as follows:
A. The gross floor area of the enlargement shall not exceed 100% of the
ground floor area of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming
portion thereof on the effective date of this section, or any amending
ordinance which later makes such structure, or portion thereof,
nonconforming.
B. It shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board
that such extension or enlargement is reasonably necessary at the
concerned location because of normal growth of business and that it
would be an unreasonable hardship on the applicant to provide for such
business growth in a zoning district where the concerned use and
structure are permitted.
C. All other applicable regulations and requirements of this chapter shall
be complied with.
D. The Board shall impose such conditions and safeguards as it deems
necessary in order to protect adjacent conforming uses and structures
against the adverse effects of such nonconformity.
E. Only one expansion shall be permitted to a maximum 100% in
Subsection A hereof, and any series of expansions shall not exceed
100% of the gross floor area at the time of enactment of the original
Zoning Ordinance No. 17-1960. (See § 300-155).
F. All enlargements or expansions are to be carried out by the owner or his
or her immediate heir for the nonconforming use registered with the
Zoning Officer at the time of enactment of the Zoning Ordinance in
Subsection E hereof.

§ 300-148. Nonconforming lots of record.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected
on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this chapter; provided, such lot was not created in violation of prior
existing zoning and subdivision regulations. Such a lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area or width or both that are generally applicable
in the district; provided, that yard dimensions and other requirements not
involving area or width or both of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of area, width and yard
requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Zoning Hearing
Board. (See § 300-127).
§ 300-149. Exceptions for nonconforming residences.
Notwithstanding the provisions above, the following regulations shall apply
to nonconforming residences located in any district:
A. An existing residence may be extended to the rear, without requiring a
variance, in spite of an existing side yard encroachment, provided the
side yard encroachment is not increased.
B. An existing structure which is destroyed by fire may be rebuilt on the
same foundation and to the preexisting dimensions, even though there
may be nonconforming uses relating to yard area, lot area or first floor
area requirements.

(8) The Board shall require the provision of a sufficient number of offstreet
parking spaces to accommodate the vehicles of the potential
average number of users of the facility at any one time.
(9) In considering applications for uses under this section, the Board
shall consider the character of the proposed use, probable method
and hours of operation and the kinds of activities which will be
carried on in relation to the character of the neighborhood and
zoning district, especially R and S, in which the proposed use would
be located.
(10) A site plan must be submitted for the review and comment of the
Board. (See § 300-183).
(11) Playgrounds, playfields and other active recreational facilities, if
designed and incorporated as an accessory use to the principal use,
shall not extend into required front or side yards or closer than 30

A. The Zoning Hearing Board determines that such use is of reasonable
size, on topography and at a location to serve the public convenience
and welfare and is not seriously detrimental to the character of the
neighborhood.
B. Safeguards are established with respect to sanitation and general
safety.
C. No structure other than a fence, similar enclosure or landscape feature
shall be closer to a property line than the buildable area of lots in the

accessory to a one- or two-family dwelling, may be located within a
required rear yard, but shall not extend closer than 15 feet to a rear lot
line or closer to a side lot line than the required side yard depth. An inground
pool shall be enclosed with a four-foot-high wall or fence, either
around the perimeter of the rear yard, or around the pool, with an
entrance which can be latched or locked to prevent unauthorized,
uncontrolled or accidental entry. An aboveground pool (all sides a
minimum of four feet above grade) shall have retractable steps that
latch and prevent access to pool when not in use. For private, public or
commercial pools, a wall or face of a dwelling or building may be used
as part of the pool enclosure. (See § 300-164).
C. Before a permit is issued to the operator or owner of the facility, other

Hearing Board showing the size of the facility, proposed use, parking
arrangement, use of the buildings and structures on the site,

equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device on pool side
keeping the door or gate securely closed at all times when not in use to
prevent unauthorized, uncontrolled entry; a barrier four feet in height
and latch shall be sufficient for private pools. (See Subsection B hereof).
H. All illumination shall be directed away from abutting properties, and all
floodlights shall be appropriately shielded so as to eliminate any direct
sight of light bulbs from outside the property lines.
I. When construction of a swimming pool is undertaken in conjunction
with and on the same parcel of land as a planned residential or unit
development, it may be considered as a part of such planned
development and deviations from lot coverage, yards and distance
requirements and parking requirements may be permitted in order to
promote a more efficient or attractive development plan but not to
permit a less adequate standard of development. (See § 300-154).
J. An adequate number of off-street parking spaces shall be provided to
accommodate the potential average number of persons using the
premises at any one time as determined by the Zoning Hearing Board,
but shall not be less than one space for every 60 square feet of water
surface in a swimming pool. The facility, if operated to attract visitors,

requirements of the zoning district.
B. The use does not involve company offices or storage areas or
structures, generating major trucking operations or excessive traffic or
heavy equipment movements, except where specified in this chapter.
C. The portion of the use not within a building, including exposed
transformers shall be enclosed on all sides by a solid wall or fence
erected to a height suitable to shield the use from surrounding
properties, retard the noise and obstruct the view of the passage of
persons and material to and from the installation, as determined by the
Zoning Hearing Board; and it is proven to the Board or the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission upon petition that such use is reasonably
necessary at the proposed location for the convenience or welfare of the
public.

§ 300-160. Adult businesses. [Added 10-13-1997 by Ord. No.
9-1997]
A. Findings of fact and conclusions of the City Council.
(1) The quality of life in the Lower Burrell community will be preserved
and protected by making some areas available for adult businesses
while preventing such businesses from locating in other areas.
(2) Prohibiting the location of adult businesses in close proximity to
residences, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, sanitariums,
retirement or convalescent homes, group homes, personal care
homes, public parks, churches and establishments which are
licensed to sell alcoholic beverages or to other adult businesses will
further the public health, safety and welfare in Lower Burrell and
serve to:
(a) Protect and maintain property values.
(b) Preserve an environment suitable to residential, educational
and institutional uses.
(c) Reduce crime and vagrancy.
(d) Promote appropriate commercial growth and development.
(e) Protect the quality of life in Lower Burrell.
(3) The Council is aware of and concerned about the proliferation of
businesses which offer, at one location, entertainment of an adult
nature, mixed with otherwise non-adult activities, such as
establishments offering food or beverages, the sale of merchandise,
personal services, etc.
(4) Such mixture of activities at one location makes the proper,
uniform and predictable application of this chapter extremely
difficult and may adversely affect the commercial and business
environment of the City.
B. Special exceptions. Adult businesses, subject to the following express
standards and criteria, and to any other standards and criteria
generally applicable to all special exceptions:
(1) Adult businesses may be established in a C-2 District.
(2) Persons or owners who intend to open an adult business must
obtain from Lower Burrell a license to operate such an enterprise
and must pay an investigative fee in an amount as established from
time to time by resolution of City Council to Lower Burrell. In
addition, such persons or owners must supply to the City detailed
238. Editor's Note: Original § 2011, Cabinet making; industrial zone, which immediately
followed this subsection, was repealed at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I).

information as to the ownership and financing as required on the
licensing application form. This form can be obtained at the office
of the Ordinance Officer.239
(3) No adult business can be located within 500 feet of a preexisting
residence, school, hospital, nursing home, sanitarium, retirement
or convalescent home, group home, personal care home, public
park, church, establishment which is licensed to and does sell
alcoholic beverages or other adult beverages.

ordinance requirements, through December 31 of the year in which
the license is issued. For each year thereafter that the adult
business intends to continue its business as an adult commercial
enterprise, it must seek from the office of the Ordinance Officer a
renewal of this license. The application for renewal is due in the
Ordinance Officer's office no later than November 1 of the year
preceding the year for which the license renewal is sought. The
lack of a license or the failure to seek license renewal on a timely
basis shall be a proper basis for the City to deny or revoke an
occupancy permit to an adult bookstore, adult movie theater or
similar adult commercial enterprise or other adult establishment.
Council may establish the license fee by resolution.
(6) Any booths, cubicles or enclosures of any type including, but not
limited to peep show booths, contained on the premises shall be
open to the view of the other patrons in the establishment. No door,
curtain or obstruction of any type which blocks or hinders the plain
view of others shall be permitted.

of the existing or approved towers and reinforcement of the
existing or approved towers cannot be accomplished at a
reasonable cost.
(b) The proposed equipment will cause RF (radio frequency)
interference with other existing or proposed equipment for
that tower or that existing or approved tower site and the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Existing or approved towers or the existing or approved tower
site do not have adequate space to accommodate the proposed
equipment.

(Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation) levels which exceed
any adopted local, federal or state emission standards.
(e) Any applicant proposing a new freestanding commercial
communications tower shall demonstrate that a good faith
effort has been made to obtain permission to mount the
§ 300-161 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-161
1:533
antenna on an existing building or other structure or an
existing commercial communications tower. A good faith effort
shall require that all owners within a 1/2 mile radius of the
proposed site be contacted by regular U.S. Mail, First Class,
postage prepaid, 10 days prior to the Planning Commission
meeting.
(f) There are other valid reasons, including but not limited to
denial of access, that make it impossible or impractical to place
the proposed equipment on any existing or proposed tower or
any existing or approved tower site. A letter shall be submitted
showing that shared use has been granted or denied.
(16) Communication towers may exceed the height limitations of the
zoning district, provided they shall be set back from adjacent
property lines the largest of the following distances as may be
applicable:
(a) A distance of 100% of the tower height from any adjacent
property.
(17) Unless the communication tower is located on a building, the tower
structure shall be completely enclosed by a ten-foot-high chain-link

(18) All guy wires and all guyed towers shall be clearly marked so as to
be visible at all times. All guy wires shall be located a minimum of
20 feet within the property line.
(19) All communication towers must be stealth towers. A "stealth tower"
is a communications tower which is not recognizable as a
conventional communications tower (e.g., a metal lattice
structure), but instead is disguised or concealed in such a fashion
as to conform to its surroundings. Examples of such stealth towers
include a tower which looks like a tree or one which is concealed in
a church steeple. In determining conformity to surroundings, the
Zoning Hearing Board will consider the following factors, at a
minimum:
(a) Height and types of trees (if applicable and when compared
with the proposed communication tower);
(b) Height and types of structures within sight distance of the
proposed communication tower;
(c) Nature of neighborhood (e.g., residential, church, golf club);
and

balloon or place an alternative object at or near the proposed
location of the communication tower for at least 14 days prior to
the public hearing on the application. The balloon or object must be
red and at least 18 inches in diameter, if spherical, or 18 inches in
height and width, if rectangular. The top of the balloon or object
must be at the maximum proposed height of the communications
tower.
(21) In granting the use, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach
reasonable conditions warranted to protect the public health,
safety and welfare, including, but not limited to, location, fencing,
screening, increased setbacks and the right to use said facilities for
public purposes.
(22) All special exception uses approved under this section will
automatically lapse if not used for six continuous months. In such a
case, all portions of the communications tower will be taken down
by the applicant, its successors or assigns, as soon as possible, but
not longer than four months after the conclusion of said six-month
period. In the event that the applicant, its successors and assigns
fail to take down the tower, the owner of the property upon which
the tower is located will be responsible for taking it down.
(23) A previously approved special exception use will lapse if an entity
operating an existing communications tower in the City does not
provide reasonable cooperation with another applicant attempting
to co-locate on said existing tower.
(24) All approvals will be only for the specific facilities set forth in the
application. No additions or alterations thereto will be permitted
without a new application.
(25) The applicant shall submit evidence that the tower and its method
of installation (including design installation during erection) has
been designed by a registered engineer and is certified by that

provided on the tower site, plus one off-street parking space for
each on-site personnel.
(30) Existing vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the maximum
extent possible.
(31) A minimum twenty-foot easement or right-of-way from a public
street for access shall be provided to the tower to accommodate
maintenance and emergency vehicles and which is improved with
an all-weather surface sufficient to accommodate the weight of
vehicles proposed to use the easement or right-of-way subject to
approval by the City council. The right-of-way or easement shall be
maintained by the landowner or lessee.
(32) Even if the tower site is an easement or leased, a site plan shall be
prepared to show the site to receive the tower described by
bearings and distances within the property from which the site has

5-2011]
(38) The applicant shall have both the duty of initial presentation of
evidence and the burden of persuasion with respect to the criteria
at Subsection A(1) through (38).
(39) If technical fees are incurred by the City, an additional application
fee may be assessed upon the applicant.
A. Purpose.
(1) The regulation of well sites herein will permit reasonable access to
a significant portion of the gas resources in the City, while
protecting certain other uses and by regulating gas and oil well use
in a manner consistent with traditional zoning regulations without
primarily regulating the technical aspects of oil and gas well
functioning.
(2) The City of Lower Burrell recognizes that the regulation of oil and
gas operations is the primary responsibility of the regulatory
agencies of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but that the City
maintains it Zoning power as set forth in 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., as
amended, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, and
through this chapter.
(3) A City also has the ability to regulate land under its police powers.
[Third Class City Code, 53 P.S. 37403]
B. Roads.
(1) Prior to any construction, the applicant shall provide a map of the
proposed routes of all trucks to be utilized for hauling to and from
the gas and oil well site, and shall minimize impact upon City roads
whenever feasible. The City reserves the right to designate
alternate routes in the event the applicant's proposed routes are
deemed inadequate, unsafe or overly disruptive to normal
vehicular traffic by the Municipal Engineer. The applicant shall also
show satisfactory evidence to the City Engineer that intersections
along proposed hauling routes provide a sufficient turning radius
for trucks, such that all turns can be safely made without damage
to vehicles, sidewalks, curbs or surrounding property. The
applicant or operator shall post a bond or other financial security in
favor of the City and in a form acceptable to the City and enter into
an excess maintenance agreement, prior to beginning operations,
regarding maintenance and repair of City roads that are to be used
by vehicles for development activities. The applicant shall conduct
an inventory, analysis and evaluation of existing road conditions on
City roads along the proposed transportation route identified by
the applicant, including photography and video. The City Excess
Maintenance Agreement will identify the responsibilities of the
§ 300-161 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-162
1:537
applicant to prepare, maintain, and repair City roads before, during
and immediately after drilling operations associated with the gas
resources development. The applicant shall take all necessary
corrective action and measures as directed by the City pursuant to
the agreement to ensure the roadways are repaired and maintained
during and immediately after drilling operations associated with
the gas resources development.
(2) In addition, should the City Engineer reasonably determine that
preventative measures, such as shoring of bridges or putting
protective mats over utility lines, should be taken to prevent
damage to City roads, bridges or utilities, then the applicant shall
install such protective measure as directed by the City Engineer,
prior to beginning operations.
(3) The City of Lower Burrell declares that oil and gas development is
conditional use in the Conservancy (S) and Industrial (I) Zoning
Districts in the City, subject to the following conditions:
(a) Where gas and oil resource development constitutes a land
development, all provisions of the applicable City ordinances
shall apply, except as preempted by state or federal law. The
well site, natural gas compressor stations or natural gas
processing plants shall comply with all setback and buffer
requirements of the zoning district in which they are located.
Equipment and drilling rigs shall be setback (a fall zone) from
protected structures, property lines, streets or buildings a
distance of one foot for every foot of height of equipment.
(b) Applicant responsibilities; construction requirements.
[1] The applicant shall take the necessary safeguards to
ensure that the City roads utilized remain free of dirt, mud
and debris resulting from development activities and/or
shall ensure such roads are promptly swept or cleaned if
dirt, mud and debris occur. Beginning with its intersection
with a public street, any access road for the development
shall be at least 20 feet in width and shall be paved with an
impervious material for the first 50 feet and consist of the
following material:
[a] Compacted subgrade.
[b] PennDOT Class 4 Geotextile Fabric.
[c] Eight inches AASHTO No. 2 Crushed Aggregate Base
Course.
[d] Two inches PennDOT 2A Aggregate (Choke Material).
[e] Four inches Compacted - Superpave 25 mm Binder
Course.
§ 300-162 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 300-162
1:538
[2] The remainder of the driveway or access road to the well
pad shall be constructed with the following material:
[a] Compacted Subgrade.
[b] Eight inches AASHTO #2 Crushed Aggregate Base
Course.
[c] Two inches PennDOT 2A Aggregate (Choke Material).
[d] The City Engineer may approve alternate design
standards that keep the driveway access road
improved to a dust free, all-weather surface for its
entire length. Operator shall take the necessary
safeguards to ensure appropriate dust control
measures are in place.
[3] Accepted professional standards pertaining to minimum
traffic sight distances for all access points shall be adhered
to.
(c) An off-street area within the development site for vehicles to
stand while gaining access to the gas well site shall be
provided so that the normal flow of traffic on the public street
is undisturbed.
(d) The applicant shall take all necessary precautions to ensure
the safety of persons in area established for road crossing and/
or adjacent to roadways. During periods of anticipated heavy
or frequent truck traffic associated with the development, the
applicant will coordinate with the City to develop a safety plan
which may include flagmen to ensure the safety of motorists
and pedestrians and take measures that include adequate
signs and/or other warning measures for truck or vehicular
traffic. Where traffic associated with the development is in
proximity of school bus stops, the operator will coordinate with
the City and School District on a safety plan to avoid truck
traffic during peak school bus activity time periods, which may
include providing flagmen to ensure the safety of children
waiting for or leaving school buses.
C. Noise. The City recognizes and acknowledges that oil and gas
development is accompanied by inherent noise. However, the operator
shall take the following steps to minimize, to the extent practicable, the
noise resulting from the development:
(1) Prior to drilling of an oil and gas well, the operator shall establish a
continuous seventy-two-hour ambient noise level at the nearest
protected structure property line or 100 feet from the nearest
protected structure (as measured to the closest exterior point of
the building), whichever is closer to the protected structure or,
alternatively, and in lieu of establishing the above seventy-two-hour
§ 300-162 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-162
1:539
ambient noise level, the operator may assume and use, for the
purposes of compliance with this section, a default ambient noise
level of 55 dBA. The sound level meter used in conducting any
evaluation shall meet the American National Standard Institute's
standard for sound meters or an instrument and the associated
recording and analyzing equipment which will provide equivalent
data.
(2) The operator shall provide documentation of any established,
seventy-two-hour evaluation, relied upon to establish an ambient
noise level greater than 55 dBA to the City's Zoning Officer within
three business days of such a request from the Zoning Officer.
(3) The noise generated during drilling and hydraulic fracturing
activities when measured at the nearest protected structure
property line or 100 feet from the nearest protected structure (as
measured to the closest exterior point of the building), whichever is
closer to the protected structure, shall not exceed the average
ambient noise level (as determined by the seventy-two-hour
evaluation) or default level, whichever is higher:
(a) During drilling activities by more than seven decibels during
the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.;
(b) During drilling activities by more than five decibels during the
hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.; or
(c) By more than 10 decibels during hydraulic fracturing
operations.
The operator shall inform the City which level (average
ambient noise level or default level) is being used.
(4) Adjustments to the foregoing noise limits may be permitted in
accordance with the following:
Permitted Increase
(dBA)
Duration of Increase
(minutes)*
5 15
10 5
15 1
20 1
* Cumulative minutes during any one hour.
(5) If a complaint is received by the City from any person, whether a
resident or otherwise using the protected structure as defined
herein for any lawful purpose; regarding noise generated during
drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities, the operator shall, within
24 hours of receipt of the complaint from the City, continuously
§ 300-162 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 300-162
1:540
monitor for a forty-eight-hour period at a point which is the closer
to the complainant's building of:
(a) The complainant's protected structure property line nearest to
the well site or equipment generating the noise; or
(b) One hundred feet from the protected structure.
(6) If the operator engages in any noise testing as required by this
section, it will provide preliminary data to the City no later than 10
business days following the completion of the noise testing. Once
the monitoring is complete, operator will meet with City
representatives and affected residents to discuss whether possible
noise abatement measures are warranted, if the permitted levels
set forth herein were exceeded. If noise levels violate the standards
set forth in this section, sound-mitigating techniques and/or
devices may be required to meet acceptable levels.
(7) Exhaust from any internal combustion engine or compressor used
in connection with the drilling of any well or for use on any
production equipment or used in development shall not be
discharged into the open air unless it is equipped with: an exhaust
muffler; or an exhaust box. The exhaust muffler or exhaust box
shall be constructed of noncombustible materials designed and
installed to suppress noise and disruptive vibrations. Moreover, all
such equipment with an exhaust muffler or exhaust box shall be
maintained in good operating condition according to
manufacturer's specifications.
(8) All work-over operations shall be restricted to the hours of 6:00
a.m. to 10:00 p.m., except in the extent of an emergency, as
reasonably determined by the Operator. "Work-over operations"
shall mean work performed in a well after its completion in an
effort to secure production where there has been none, restore
production that has ceased, or increase production.
D. Emergency services.
(1) The operator shall, prior to drilling, provide the City adequate
information to deal with any potential dangerous conditions that
may result due to development activities. First responders shall
have on-site orientation and be provided adequate awareness
information. Upon request from the City, operator will, prior to
drilling of an oil and gas well, make available with at least 30 days'
notice, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate site orientation
for first responders. Such site orientation shall be made available at
least annually during the period when the operator anticipates
drilling activities in the City.
(2) Operator shall provide appropriate maps, material safety data
sheets and/or its hydraulic fracturing formula and emergency plan
and Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency Plan (PPC)
§ 300-162 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-162
1:541
documents to the City Manager. The operator shall provide 24/7
contact information, including a supervisor's name and a toll-free
number, to all City emergency service providers, the City Manager
and on signage at the entrance to the well site. Warning signs must
be posted providing notice of potential dangers at the well site.
E. Lighting.
(1) Recognizing that adequate and appropriate lighting is essential to
the safety of those involved in the development of oil and gas, the
operator shall take steps, to the extent practicable, to direct sight
lighting downward and inward toward the drill site, wellhead, or
other area being developed so as to attempt to minimize glare on
public roads and adjacent buildings within 300 feet of the drill site,
wellhead, or other area being developed.
(2) Recognizing that the specific location of equipment and facilities is
an important an integral part of oil and gas development, as part of
the planning process, operator shall strive to consider location of
its temporary and permanent operation, where prudent and
possible, so as to minimize interference with City residents'
enjoyment of their property.
F. Pre-drilling notice. Prior to drilling an oil and gas well, but not later
than two weeks prior to drilling, the operator shall provide the
following information to each resident within 1,000 feet of the planned
surface location of the well:
(1) A copy of the well survey plat showing the locations of the planned
wells;
(2) A general description of the planned operations at the planned well
and associated equipment used in the development of the well;

§ 300-182. Variances.
The Board, upon appeal, shall have the power to authorize variances from
the requirements of this chapter, and to attach such conditions to the

A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the necessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by
the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, not
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
necessary to afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.

has been approved by an appropriate City officer, agency or body, if
such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval
in any manner, unless such person alleges and proves that he had no
prior notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had
been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such
approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in
interest.
B. The failure of anyone, other than the landowner, to appeal from an
adverse decision on an application for tentative approval of a planned
residential development or from an adverse decision by a Zoning
Officer on a challenge to the validity of an ordinance or map filed
pursuant to Section 916.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code (Act 247, as amended),309 shall preclude an appeal from a final
approval, except in the case where the final submission substantially
deviates from the approved tentative approval.
C. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.
A. Upon filing of any proceeding and during its pendency before the
Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance,
order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and all
official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or
any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property,
in which case the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the
Board or by the Court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition
after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body.
When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been
duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the applicant,
the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of the zoning
appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing
the proceedings before the Board. The question whether or not such
309. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
§ 300-187 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-189

petition should be granted and the amount of the bond shall be within
the sound discretion of the court.
B. All appeals from decisions rendered by the Zoning Hearing Board shall
be taken to the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas and shall
be filed within 30 days after the entry of the decision or, in the case of a
deemed decision, within 30 days after the date upon which notice of
said deemed decision is given.

ARTICLE XXIV
Amendments
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 300-190. Enactment of Zoning Ordinance amendments.
§ 300-191. Procedure for landowner curative amendments.
A. The City Council may from time to time amend, supplement, or repeal
any of the regulations and provisions of this chapter. The procedure for
the preparation of a proposed zoning ordinance as set forth in § 607 of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10607, is
hereby declared optional.
B. Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the City Council shall
hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. In addition, if
the proposed amendment involves a Zoning Map change, notice of said
public hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the City at points
deemed sufficient by the City along the perimeter of the tract to notify
potentially interested citizens. The affected tract or area shall be posted
at least one week prior to the date of the hearing.
C. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the Planning
Commission, the City Council shall submit each such amendment to the
Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such
proposed amendment to provide the Planning Commission an
opportunity to submit recommendations.
D. If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is changed substantially, or is revised to include land
previously not affected by it, the City Council shall hold another public
hearing, pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on the
amendment.
E. At least 30 days prior to the public hearing on the amendment by the
City Council, the City shall submit the proposed amendment to the
County planning agency for recommendations.
F. Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this
chapter shall be forwarded to the County planning agency.
A. A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the
validity of this chapter or the Zoning Map or any provision thereof
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the City Council
with a written request that his challenge and proposed amendment be
heard and decided as provided in § 916.1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S. § 10916.1. The
curative amendment and challenge shall be referred to the Planning
Commission and the County planning agency as provided in § 609 and
§ 300-190 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-191
1:599
§ 300-192. Procedure for City curative amendments.
notice of the hearing thereon shall be given as provided in §§ 610 and
916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10609, 10610, and 10916.1.
B. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with § 908 of the MPC, 53
P.S. § 10908, and all references therein to the Zoning Hearing Board
shall, for purposes of this section, be references to the City Council. If
the City does not accept a landowner's curative amendment brought in
accordance with this section and a court subsequently rules that the
challenge has merit, the court's decision shall not result in a declaration
of invalidity for this entire chapter and Zoning Map, but only for those
provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's curative
amendment and challenge.
C. The City Council, if it determines that a validity challenge has merit,
may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without
revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the
challenged defects. The City Council shall consider the curative
amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of this chapter or Zoning Map;
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the
tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts; and
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
A. If the City determines that this chapter, or any portion hereof, is
substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
(1) The City shall declare by formal action, this chapter or portions
hereof substantially invalid and propose to prepare a curative
amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days of such
declaration and proposal, the City Council shall:
§ 300-191 LOWER BURRELL CODE § 300-192
1:600
§ 300-193. Amendments.
(a) By resolution make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of this chapter, which may include:
[1] References to specific uses which are either not permitted
or not permitted in sufficient quantity;
[2] Reference to a class of use or uses which requires revision;
or
[3] Reference to this entire chapter which requires revisions.
(b) Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to this
chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
B. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the City
shall enact a curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm the validity of,
this chapter pursuant to the provisions of § 609 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S. § 10609, in
order to cure the declared invalidity of this chapter.
C. Upon the initiation of the procedures as set forth in Subsection A, the
Planning Commission shall not be required to entertain or consider any
landowner's curative amendment filed under § 609.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S.
§ 10609.1, nor shall the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a
report requested under § 909.1 or 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10909.1
or 10916.1, subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon the
grounds identical or substantially similar to those specified by the
resolution required by Subsection A(1). Upon completion of the
procedures set forth in Subsections A and B, no rights to a cure
pursuant to the provisions of §§ 609.1 and 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S.
§§ 10609.1 and 10916.1, shall, from the date of the declaration and
proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive
invalidity of this chapter for which there has been a curative
amendment pursuant to this section.
D. The City, having utilized the procedures set forth in this section, may
not again utilize said procedure for a period of 36 months following the
date of enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the
validity of this chapter; provided, however, if after the date of
declaration and proposal there is a substantially new duty imposed
upon the City by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a
Pennsylvania appellate court decision, the City may utilize the
provisions of this section to propose a curative amendment to this
chapter to fulfill said duty or obligation.
A. Amendments to this chapter shall become effective only after a public
hearing held pursuant to public notice. A brief summary setting forth
the principal provisions of the proposed amendment and a reference to
the place within the City where copies of the proposed amendment may
be secured or examined shall be incorporated in the public notice.
§ 300-192 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 300-193
1:601
§ 300-194. Rejected petitions.
If, after a public hearing, Council rejects a petition for changing zoning
district boundaries for any lot, combination of lots or portion of a lot, no
person shall file a petition for changing the zoning district boundaries for
any lot, combination of lots or portion of lots or any part thereof which was
rejected by Council for at least one year from the date of Council rejection.
Unless the proposed amendment shall have been prepared by the
Planning Commission, the City Council shall submit the amendment
to the Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on
such amendment to provide the Planning Commission an opportunity
to submit recommendations. In addition, at least 30 days prior to the
public hearing on the amendment, the City shall submit the proposed
amendment to the County planning agency for recommendations.
B. Within 30 days after adoption, the City shall forward a certified copy of
the amendment to the County planning agency.
C. Proposed amendments shall not be enacted unless notice of proposed
enactment is given in the manner set forth in this section, and shall
include the time and place of the meeting at which passage will be
considered, a reference to a place within the City where copies of the
proposed amendment may be examined without charge or obtained for
a charge not greater than the cost thereof. The City Council shall
publish the proposed amendment once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City not more than 60 days nor less than seven days
prior to passage. Publication of the proposed amendment shall include
either the full text thereof or the title and a brief summary, prepared by
the City Solicitor and setting forth all the provisions in reasonable
detail. If the full text is not included:
(1) A copy thereof shall be supplied to a newspaper of general
circulation in the City at the time the public notice is published.
(2) An attested copy of the proposed amendment shall be filed in the
County law library (or other County office designated by the County
Commissioners).
D. In the event substantial amendments are made in the proposed
amendment, before voting upon enactment, the City Council shall, at
least 10 days prior to enactment, readvertise, in one newspaper of
general circulation in the City, a brief summary setting forth all the
provisions in reasonable detail together with a summary of the
amendments.
