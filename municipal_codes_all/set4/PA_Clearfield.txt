structure. If such a request is denied, appeal can be taken
to the Zoning Hearing Board.
B. Continuation. Any unlawful use of a structure or land
existing at the effective date of this Ordinance, may be

by such use and held in single and/or separate ownership
at the effective date of this Ordinance when authorized
as a special exception; provided that any extension or
enlargement shall conform to the area, height and setback
regulations of the district in which it is situated, and
further provided that each extension does not replace a
conforming use, or extend beyond an area equivalent to
the minimum area permitted for a same or similar use in
a zone permitting such use.
D. Changes. A nonconforming use of a building or land may be
changed to a use of an equal or more restricted classification
or to a conforming use, but, such use shall not thereafter be
changed to a use of less restricted classification.
E. Restoration. A nonconforming building and/or structure which
has been damaged or destroyed by fire or other causes to the
extent that replacement cost will exceed fifty (50) percent of
its real value prior to damage, or a nonconforming building
which has been legally condemned, may not be reconstructed and
used for any nonconforming use unless authorized by special
exception and subject to regulations designed to minimize any
adverse affects on conforming uses.

ceases for a period of one (1) year or more, subsequent use of
such building or land shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance.

effective date of this Ordinance and the proposed use of land
and/or building does not conform with this Ordinance, said
proposed use shall be regulated by the nonconforming use
requirements of this Ordinance and shall be considered the
same as a lawful nonconforming use if construction other than
excavation and foundations, is undertaken within a period of
thirty (30) calendar days after the issuance date of said
building permit and construction thereof is completed within
twelve (12) calendar months from the issuance date of the
building permit.

514. Planned Residential Development.
Purpose. The purpose of the planned residential development
regulations is to encourage the flexibility in the design and
development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use;
to encourage grouping of housing and a mixture of housing types in
alternative patterns and in a variety of ways; to facilitate the
adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; and to
preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open areas. Planned
residential developments are permitted in the R-D and R-S
Districts. Mobile homes and mobile home parks are to be excluded
from Planned Residential Development.
514.1 Minimum Development Size. No planned residential
development may include less than five (5) acres of contiguous
land.
514.2 General Standards. The planned residential development
must

meet all of the following general standards:
-
The planned residential development is consistent with
the Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance's Statement of
Community Development Objectives.
The planned residential development is an effective and
unified treatment of the development possibilities on the
project site.
The planned residential development shall be planned and
developed to harmonize with any existing or proposed
development in the area surrounding the project site.
Performance bond for all improvements in the development
must be posted. For all public improvements (i.e.,
public streets, water, sanitary sewers and storm drains),
the developer shall provide surety to the Borough or
appropriate public agency. The amount, type, processing,
release from and related actions shall be consistent with
Sections 509 and 510 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code. [See also Section 514.8(f)].
Connection to the sanitary sewer system shall be
required.

514.3 Applicable Districts and Uses Permitted. Planned
residential developments may be approved in the R-S and R-D
Residential Development District and may include the following
additional uses: multiple-family dwellings and related uses.
Such additional uses shall be allowed only to the extent that
the Borough finds them to be compatibly and harmoniously
incorporated into the design of the planned development.
(Mobile homes and mobile home parks are excluded from the
planned residential development district.)
514.4 Calculations of Project Densities. The number of
dwelling units which may be constructed within the planned
residential development shall be determined by dividing the
gross project area by the required lot area per dwelling unit
which is required in the R-S or R-D District (see below).
514.5 Increase in Density. It is recognized that the expense
of complying with the approval process contained in the
planned residential development regulations may discourage
developers from seeking approval of a planned residential
development project. At the time the outline or preliminary
development plan is filed, the applicant may apply for an
increase in the densities permitted by the zone in which the
planned residential development is to be constructed. If it
gives its approval to the planned residential development, the
Borough Council may authorize the developer to increase
permitted densities by an amount up to ten (10) percent.
Additional increase in density may be granted up to twentyseven
( 2 7 ) percent providing:
a. If common open space is developed to more intense usable
open space providing facilities for active outdoor
recreation, such as playgrounds, playground equipment,
picnic facilities, ball fields and equipment, or other
similar improvements to the open space, an additional ten
(10) percent increase in density may be permitted.
b. If item (a), above, is developed and unique indooroutdoor
buildings, to be used for recreation or other
similar activities of the residents of the development,
such as swimming pools, club houses, or other similar
buildings are provided, then an additional seventeen (17)
percent increase in density may be permitted.
514.6 The location of all
structures shall be as shown on final plans. The proposed
location and arrangement shall not be detrimental to existing
or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the existing or
prospective development of the neighborhood. There shall be
no minimum lot size, no minimum or maximum percentage of lot
coverage and no minimum lot width in the planned residential
Lot Size and Spacing of Buildings.

development. However, every single-family dwelling shall have
access to a public street, court, walkway, or other area
dedicated to public use. No dwelling and no addition to any
dwellings shall be erected within a distance of less than the
height of the highest adjacent building.
Vehicular access to dwellings by means of adequate service
drives and/or emergency entrances shall be provided in all
cases where dwellings do not front on a public street, or
where the Borough deems necessary for public safety.
514.7 Perimeter Requirements. The requirements of this
section apply only to structures located within two hundred
( 2 0 0 ) feet of the perimeter of a planned residential
development. If topographical or other barriers do not
provide adequate privacy for existing uses adjacent to the
planned residential development, the Planning Commission may
require either or both of the following:
a. Structures located on the perimeter of the planned
residential development must be set back by a distance
sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent
existing uses, in no case less than the height of the
buildings.
b. Structures located on the perimeter of the planned
residential development must be permanently screened in
a manner which is sufficient to protect the privacy and
amenity of adjacent existing uses.
514.8 Common Open Space Required. The development plan will
contain areas to be allocated for common open space which
satisfy the standards governing the usability and quality of
common open space that is contained in this Ordinance.
No open area may be accepted as common open space under the
provisions of this Ordinance unless it meets the following
standards:
a. A minimum of one (1) acre of common open space shall be
provided including usable and scenic green space for the
first five (5) acres plus one (1) acre for each
additional five (5) acres or fraction thereof of gross
project area.
b. The location, shape, size, and character of the common
open space must be suitable for the planned residential
development.
c. Common open space must be suitably improved for its
intended use, but common open space containing natural
features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved.

The building, structures, and improvements which are
permitted in the common open space must be appropriate to
the uses which are authorized for the common open space
and must conserve and enhance the amenities of the common
open space having regard to its topography and unimproved
condition.
e. The development schedule which is part of the development
plan must coordinate the improvement of the common open
space, the construction of buildings, structures, and
improvements in the common open space, and the
construction of residential dwellings in the planned
residential development.
f. If the final development plan provides for buildings,
structures, and improvements in the common open space of
a value in excess of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, the
developer must provide a bond in the estimated amount of
the improvements assuring that the buildings, structures,
and improvements will be completed. The Borough Council
shall release the bond or other assurance when the
buildings, structures, or improvements have been
completed according to the development plan.
514.9 Conveyance and Maintenance of Common Space. All land
shown on the final development plan as common open space must
be conveyed under one of the following options:
a. It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to
maintain the common open space and any buildings,
structures, or improvements which have been placed on it,
in which case the general public must have use of the
open space.
b. It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture
establishing an association or similar organization for
the maintenance of the planned residential development.
The common open space must be conveyed to the trustees
subject to covenants to be approved by the Borough which
restrict the common open space to the uses specified on
the final development plan, and which provide for the
maintenance of the common open space in a manner which
assures its containing use for its intended purpose.
(1) No common open space may be put to any use not
specified in the final development plan unless the
final development plan has been amended to permit
that use. However, no change of use authorized
under Section 514.3 may be considered as a waiver
of any of the covenants limiting the use of common
open space areas, and all rights to enforce these
v-14
I
I '
I
I
I
I
I
I

covenants against any use not permitted are
expressly reserved.
(2) If the common open space is not conveyed to a
public agency, either one of the following methods
of enforcement must be provided:
(i) The legal right to develop the common open
space for the uses not specified in the final
development plan must be approved by the
Borough.
(ii) The restrictions governing the use,
improvement, and maintenance of the common
open space must be stated as conditions to the
conveyance of the common open space, the fee
title to the common open space to vest in a
public agency in the event of a substantial
default in the stated conditions.
(iii) If the common open space is not conveyed to
the Borough, or a public agency approved by
the Borough, the covenants governing the use,
improvement, and maintenance of the common
open space shall then be enforceable by the
Borough, and the instrument of conveyance
shall so provide.
(iv) It is the purpose and intent of these
regulations that the Borough shall have the
authority and powers to require the adequate
maintenance of common open space as set forth
by Article VI1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.
514.10 Application for Tentative Approval of Planned
Residential Development. In order to provide an expeditious
method for processing a development plan for a planned
residential development under the provisions of this
Ordinance, and to avoid the delay and uncertainty which would
arise if it were necessary to secure approval, by a
multiplicity of procedures, of a plat of subdivision as well
as approval of a change in the zoning regulations otherwise
applicable to the property, it is hereby declared to be in the

tentative approval and with any specified conditions
attached thereto. The submission shall be reviewed by
the Zoning Officer and the Planning Commission for
compliance prior to being forwarded to the Borough
Council. This review is to take place in thirty-five
(35) days.

variations from the development plan given tentative
approval, the Borough may refuse to grant final approval
and shall, within forty-five (45) days from the filing of
the application for final approval, so advise the
landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in
said notice the reasons why one or more of said
variations are not in the public interest. In the event
of such refusal, the landowner may either:
(1) ref iled his/her application for final approval
without the variations objected, or
(2) file a written request with the approving body that
it hold a public hearing on his/her application for
final approval.
If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate
action, he may do so at any time within which he shall be
entitled to apply for final approval, or within thirty
(30) additional days if the time for applying for final
approval shall have already passed at the time when the
landowner was advised that the development plan was not
in substantial compliance. In the event the landowner
shall fail to take either of these alternative actions
within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned
the development plan. Any such public hearing shall be
held pursuant to public notice within thirty (30) days
after request for the hearing is made by the landowner,
and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner
prescribed in this part for public hearings on
applications for tentative approval. Within thirty (30)
days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Borough

H. Variances: The Board shall hear requests for variances where
it is alleged that the provisions of this Ordinance inflict
unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may by

are made where relevant in a given case:

2.
3 .
4.
5.
That there are unique physical circumstances or
conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to
the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located;
That because of such physical circumstances or
conditions, there is no possibility that the property can
be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of
this Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of
the property;
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by
the applicant;
That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare; and
That the variance, if authorized, will represent the
minimum variance that will afford relief and will
represent the least modification possible of the
regulation in issue.

6 . Variances for Floodplain Districts. If compliance with

Ordinance would result in an exceptional hardship for a

application of the requirement.

in accordance with the procedures contained in Section
602 of the following procedures:

b.
C.
d.
e.

modification necessary to provide relief.
In granting any variance, the Borough shall attach
whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it
considers necessary in order to protect the public
health, safety and welfare, and to achieve the
objectives of this Ordinance.
Whenever a variance is granted, the Borough shall
notify the applicant, in writing, that:
(i) the granting of the variance may result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance;
(ii) such variances may increase the risks to life
and property.
In reviewing any request for a variance, the
Borough shall consider, but not be limited to, the
following:
(i) that there is good and sufficient cause;
(ii) that the failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant;
(iii) that the granting of the variance will not
result in an unacceptable or prohibited
increase in flood heights, additional threats
to public safety, extraordinary public
