§420-13 Designation of Districts
ARTICLE IV
DISTRICT REGULATIONS
District Regulations Page IV - 1

Zoning Districts:
R-1 Low Density Residential District
R-2 Medium Density Residential District
B-1 Local Business/Residential District
M-1 Light Manufacturing District
M-2 General Manufacturing/Industrial District
B. Intent.
(1) R-1 Low Density Residential District. To provide for the continued development of lower density
residential neighborhoods with high quality living conditions and without the conflicts with nonresidential
uses, while providing for community-related uses under appropriate conditions.
(2) R-2 Medium Density Residential District. To provide for the continued development of medium density
residential neighborhoods with high quality living conditions while providing for community-related uses
under appropriate conditions.
(3) B-1 Local Business/Residential District. To provide for the development of general commercial trades
and retail/service activities along with a variety of residential dwellings.
(4) M-1 Light Manufacturing District. To provide for a wide variety of retail/service commercial uses to serve
the needs of surrounding residents along with other nonresidential uses governed by performance
standards. Dwellings are also permitted to provide for a live/work community. Higher intensity
nonresidential uses are allowed under certain conditions.
(5) M-2 General Manufacturing/Industrial District. To provide areas for a variety of retail/service commercial,
corporate, professional, light manufacturing and industrial uses with easy access to Interstate Route 81
and availability of required utilities.
§420-14 Official Zoning Map
A. Adoption. The location and boundaries of said districts are hereby established as shown on the Official
Zoning Map of West Hazleton Borough; which is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this chapter together with all amendments thereto.
B. Map Changes. Changes to the boundaries and districts of the Official Zoning Map shall only be made in
conformity with the amendment procedures specified by the Municipalities Planning Code.
C. Replacement Map. If the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret
because of changes and additions, or drafting errors or omissions require correction, the Borough Council
may, by resolution, adopt a new copy of the Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official
Zoning Map. Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map
or any remaining parts shall be preserved together with all available records pertaining to its previous
adoption or amendment.
§420-15 District Boundaries
A. Establishment. District boundary lines are intended to follow or be parallel to the center line of streets,
streams and railroads, and lot or property lines as they exist on a recorded deed or plan of record in the
Luzerne County Recorder of Deeds Office and on the Luzerne County Tax Maps at the time of the enactment
of this chapter, unless such district boundary lines are fixed by dimensions or otherwise as shown on the
Official Zoning Map.
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning District Regulations Page IV - 2
B. Interpretation. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets
or highways, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines, such center lines, street lines, or highway right-of-way
lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they
approximately follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. Where district
boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets, or
the center lines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel
thereto and at such distance as indicated on the Official Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimensions
shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Official Zoning Map. Where the boundary of a
district follows a railroad line, such boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of
said railroad line.
C. Uncertainty. In the event of uncertainty as to the true location of a district boundary line in a particular
instance, the Zoning Officer is authorized to determine the correct district boundary in accord with the
guidelines of this chapter. Any decision of the Zoning Officer may be appealed to the Zoning Hearing Board.
D. Divided Lot: Where a boundary line divides a lot held in single ownership at the time of the initial passage of
this chapter, the regulations for the less restricted district may extend to the entire lot, provided such
extension does not exceed a distance of 35 feet beyond the boundary of such district.
§420-16 District Regulations
District regulations are of two types, the Schedule of Uses and the Schedule of Development Standards, which
shall apply to any proposed new use, expansion of an existing use or change of use of any land or structure.
A. Use Regulations. District Use Regulations are provided in the following Schedule of Uses.
(1) Limitations
(a) No land and no structure in a particular zoning district shall be used for any use which is not
specifically listed on the Schedule of Uses for that particular district, and only in accord with all other
requirements of this chapter. In other words, any use not allowed as a principal permitted use,
accessory use, conditional use or special exception, or allowed by the Zoning Hearing Board in
accord with §420-16B within a particular zoning district, shall be deemed to be prohibited within that
zoning district.
(b) If a use which could be included in a more general use is listed as a separate use in any District
Schedule of Uses, such use shall be permitted only in the district where it is specifically listed.
(c) Larger lot sizes, greater setbacks, buffers and other more restrictive standards may be required by
other provisions of this chapter.
(2) Principal Permitted Uses and Accessory Uses. Permits for principal permitted uses and accessory uses
shall be issued by the Zoning Officer provided such uses comply with the standards in this chapter.
(3) Conditional Uses and Special Exceptions. Conditional uses and special exceptions are permitted uses
which require individual consideration because of their special characteristics and are referred to the
Planning Commission for review and preparation of a recommendation to the Borough Council and
Zoning Hearing Board, respectively. Following a public hearing and based on its determination that the
proposed use meets the standards of this chapter, the Borough Council for conditional uses and the
Zoning Hearing Board for special exceptions shall approve the issuance of a zoning permit by the Zoning
Officer.
B. Uses Not Specified in Schedule of Uses. This §420-16B addresses, by special exception, a proposed use
which is neither specifically permitted nor specifically denied in any zoning district established under this
chapter.
( 1) Jurisdiction - Whenever an application is made to the Zoning Officer for such a use, the application shall
be submitted to the Zoning Hearing Board which shall have the authority to permit the use or deny the
use as a special exception.
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning District Regulations Page IV • 3
(2) Findings - The use may be permitted only if the Zoning Hearing Board makes all of the following findings;
and, the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant:
(a) The use is similar to and compatible with the uses listed for the subject zoning district by the
Schedule of Use Regulations.
(b) The use in no way conflicts with the intent of the zoning district and the general purpose and intent of
this chapter.
(c) The use is not permitted in any other zoning district in the Borough.
{d} The use where proposed would be consistent with the Borough Comprehensive Plan.
(3) Planning Commission Review - At the time the application is submitted to the Zoning Hearing Board, the
Zoning Officer shall also provide a copy to the Borough Planning Commission for review and
recommendation.
(4) Conditions - The Zoning Hearing Board may attach reasonable conditions and safeguards to any special
exception approval granted for a use not specified in the Schedule of Uses, incorporating standards in
this chapter for similar uses in the district and such other conditions as the Zoning Hearing Board may
deem necessary to protect and promote the public health, safety, morals and welfare and to implement
the purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.

§420-29F is not necessarily required to meet the immediate needs of the proposed use, the Borough may
require the number of spaces provided to be reduced by a maximum of twenty-five (25) percent. The
developer shall dedicate sufficient and suitable area to future parking to meet the normal standards in this
§420-29F.

data, such as number of employees and peak expected number of customers/visitors. Any approval to
permit such decrease or increase shall be subject to the following:
(a) Chapter and Plan Consistency. The project design and parking space decrease shall be consistent
with the purposes contained in this chapter and the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
(b) Quality of Design. The applicant shall demonstrate to the Borough Council that the proposed
decrease will result in an adequate number of parking spaces or the increase will not produce an
excess number of spaces for the use based on a specific study of the parking demands for the
proposed use or empirical data reported by a generally accepted source such as the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, the Urban Land Institute, the American Planning Association, or similar
entity.
(c) Local Conditions. In making its determination the Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board shall
also consider, among others, the demographics and character of the neighborhood, demographics of
targeted customers and employees, availability of mass transit, existing on-street parking conditions,
and any employer instituted transportation demand management programs.
(d) Burden; Conditions.
[1] If the Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, in its sole discretion, determines that the
applicant has met the burden of proof, it may grant a conditional use for the decrease or increase.
[2] In no case shall parking be reduced by more than 30 percent nor be increased by more than 20
percent of the minimum parking requirement.
[3] If the applicant provides more parking spaces than the minimum required, the additional parking
spaces shall not result in the removal of specimen trees.
[4] The Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board may impose such conditions as will, in its
judgment, secure the objectives and purposes of this chapter, including, but not limited to,
reserving parking.

the Borough or PA DOT, as the case may be. In the case of a change in use or the expansion of an
existing use, a highway occupancy permit or a revised highway occupancy permit shall be required if
there will be increase in average daily traffic based on the most recent edition of the International Traffic
Engineers Traffic Generation Manual. Where a use accesses the public right-of-way via a private road,
the highway occupancy permit requirement and criteria shall be applied at the public right-of-way
intersection.
(4) Interior Travelways. The applicant shall demonstrate that travelways within the property are adequate
to safely and efficiently serve vehicles which are reasonably expected to visit the property. Turning
radius templates developed by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) shall serve as the design standard.

group housing, if applicable. A copy of any such license or certification shall be filed with the Borough and
shall be required to be shown to the Zoning Officer in the future upon request. The group home shall notify
the Borough within fourteen (14) days if there is a change in the type of clients, the sponsoring agency, the
maximum number of residents or if an applicable certification/license expires, is suspended or is withdrawn.
C. Registration. The group home shall register its location, general type of treatment/care, maximum number of
residents and sponsoring agency with the Zoning Officer. Such information shall be available for public
review upon request.
D. Counseling. Any medical or counseling services provided on the lot shall be limited to residents and a
maximum of three (3) nonresidents per day.
E. Parking. One off-street parking space shall be provided for each employee on duty at any one time, and
every two (2) residents of a type reasonably expected to be capable of driving a vehicle. Off-street parking
areas of more than five (5) spaces shall be buffered from adjacent existing single-family dwellings by a
planting screen meeting the requirements of §§420-43.
F. Appearance. If the group home is in a R-1 or R-2 District, the building shall be maintained and/or
constructed to ensure that it is closely similar in appearance, condition and character to the other residential
structures in the area. No exterior signs shall identify the type of use.
G. Bulk' and Density. The construction of new group homes shall comply with the minimum lot size and other

D. Exterior Changes. There shall be no exterior changes to a building, excluding safety measures including fire
escapes.
§420-38 Functional Families
A. Purpose. This §420-38 is to provide for the regulation of functional families that may request to reside in a
dwelling unit and to prohibit larger groups of unrelated persons from residing in dwelling units. Larger groups
of unrelated persons have been frequently shown to have a detrimental effect on residential neighborhoods
since larger groups of unrelated persons do not live as a family unit and do not have significant economic or
emotional ties to the neighborhood.
B. Special Exception; Standards. The Zoning Hearing Board shall consider each application for a functional
family as a special exception and, among others, consider the following:
(1) Proposed occupants:
(a) Share a strong bond or commitment to a single purpose (e.g., religious orders);
(b) Are not legally dependent on others not part of the functional family;
(c) Can establish legal domicile as defined by Pennsylvania law;
(d) Share costs of food, rent or ownership, utilities and other household expenses;
(e) Prepare food and eat together regularly;
(f) Share in the work to maintain the premises;
(g) Legally share in the ownership or possession of the premises; and
(h) Share the entire dwelling unit or act as separate roomers.
(2) Whether the household has stability akin to a permanent family. The criteria used to make this
determination may include, among others, the following:
(a) The length of stay together among the occupants in the current dwelling unit or other dwelling
units;
(b) The presence of minor, dependent children regularly residing in the household;
(c) Whether the household is a temporary living arrangement or a framework for transient living; and,
(d) Whether the composition of the household changes from year to year or within the year.
(3) Any other factor reasonably related to whether or not the group of persons is the functional equivalent
of a family.
C. Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board may impose such additional conditions as it deems necessary for the
general welfare, for the protection of individual property rights, and for ensuring that the intent and objectives
of this chapter will be observed.

Performance Standards
§420-42 Intent and Applicability and Affidavit
A. Intent and Applicability. The intent of this Part 2 is to regulate the development and operation of all
development in the Borough and to protect the environment and the public health, safety and general welfare.
No land or building shall be used or occupied in such manner which creates any dangerous, injurious,
noxious, or otherwise objectionable condition in such amount to adversely affect the surrounding area, and
any such activity is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. However, any use permitted by this chapter may
be undertaken and maintained if it conforms to all applicable requirements of this chapter, including the
standards in this Part 2 which are intended to limit nuisance elements. The following performance standards
shall apply to all proposed new or expanded nonresidential uses, and residential uses explicitly referenced by
a specific section. The standards in this Part 2 shall not apply to normal agricultural uses unless explicitly
referenced by a specific section.
B. Affidavit.
(1) With the exception of residential uses, the applicant for a Zoning Permit for any other principal or
accessory use shall include with such application an affidavit acknowledging his understanding of the
performance standards in this Part 2 and applicable to such use and affirming his agreement to conduct
or operate such use at all times in conformance with such standards.
(2) The Right to Know Law protects certain information submitted in connection with a zoning permit from
public disclosure by the Borough. §708(3) of the Right to Know Law, 65 P.S. 67.708(3), exempts, "A
record, the disclosure of which creates a reasonable likelihood of endangering the safety or the physical
security of a building, public utility, resource, infrastructure, facility or information storage system, which
may include ... (iii) building plans or infrastructure records that expose or create vulnerability through
disclosure of the location, configuration or security of critical systems, including public utility systems,
structural elements, technology, communication, electrical, fire suppression, ventilation, water,
wastewater, sewage and gas systems." Additionally, §708(11) of the Right to Know Law, 65 P.S.
67.708(11 ), exempts, "A record that constitutes or reveals a trade secret or confidential proprietary
information." An applicant for a zoning permit may designate application material submitted to the
Borough meeting the exemption criteria of the Right to Know Law as confidential. Such confidential
information shall thereafter be protected from public disclosure by the Borough to the extent permitted by
law.
(3) Regardless of whether or not a use is required to comply with the procedure specified in this §420-42B,
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Standards: Page VII - 3
every use shall comply with all performance standards.
§420-43 Setbacks and Buffers
Unless otherwise regulated by this chapter, where a nonresidential use in any B-1, M-1 or M-2 District is proposed
contiguous to any R-1 or R-2 District the minimum size of the abutting setback shall be increased by fifty (50)
percent and a landscaped buffer not less than five (5) feet in width shall be provided in accord with this §420-43.
Storage of equipment, supplies, products or any other materials shall not be permitted in any front setback or side
setback.
In the case of conditional uses and special exceptions, landscaped buffers may be required by the Borough in any
setback in order to assure the protection of adjoining uses by providing visual barriers that block the glare of
lights; reduce noise; serve as a protective barrier by blocking physical passage to dangerous areas; and reduce
air pollution, dust and litter; and, to otherwise maintain and protect the rural character of the District.
A. In determining the type and extent of the buffer required, the Borough shall take into consideration the design
of the project structure(s) and site, topographic features which may provide natural buffering, existing natural
vegetation, and the relationship of the proposed project to adjoining areas.
B. The width of the required buffer, as determined by the Borough, shall not be less than fifteen (15) feet.
C. A mix of ground cover and shrubbery vegetation and canopy trees, of such variety compatible with the local
climate, may be required so that a dense screen not less than six (6) feet in height will be formed within three
(3) years of planting. Plants shall be species identified by Chapter 360 (Subdivision and Land Development).
D. Berms and landscaped walls or fences, compatible with the principal building design, may be incorporated in
the required buffer. Front yard buffers shall be provided in the same manner to a height of not less than four
(4) feet; however, all clear sight triangles shall be maintained.
E. In any case, special consideration shall be given to existing residential uses and sites where residential uses
are likely to be developed. In cases where the adjoining use is a commercial use, or when two or more
adjacent properties are developed under a common site plan, the width and density of the buffer may be
reduced if the Borough shall determine that the proposed use and adjoining use(s) are not incompatible.
F. Design details of buffers shall be included on the site plan, and buffers shall be considered "improvements"
for the purposes of guaranteeing installation in accord with the requirements for "land developments" in
Chapter 360 (Subdivision and Land Development). It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to
maintain all buffers in good condition and replace any dying or dead plants or deteriorating landscape
material.
§420-44 Landscaoina
A landscaping plan for the proposed project shall be submitted by the developer for review and approval by the
Borough. Where the project involves landscaping of more than one-half (0.5) acre the plan shall be prepared by a
qualified registered landscape architect, professional planner or registered professional engineer. Landscaping
for land developments shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 360 (Subdivision and Land Development).
The landscaping plan shall include the overall design of the landscaping proposed, the type and size of vegetation
to be utilized, and details of installation. Landscaping shall be installed to the following minimum standards.
A. All disturbed areas of the site shall be included in the landscaping plan, and those areas immediately adjacent
to buildings and walkways shall be given extra consideration.

actions shall be provided by the developer for review by the local fire company(s). In the case of conditional uses
and special exceptions, larger setbacks, additional buffer areas or fencing may be required by the Borough if the
nature of the proposed use as determined by the Borough so requires. (See §420-114D for tire storage.)
§420-47 Radioactivity or Electric Disturbance
No activities shall be permitted which emit dangerous radioactivity, electrical disturbance or electromagnetic
radiation adversely affecting the operation of any person or any equipment other than that of the creator of such
disturbance. All applicable Federal regulations shall apply.
§420-48 Noise
A. Definitions.
(1) A-weighted Noise Level (dBA). A measure of sound pressure in decibels with the sound pressure scale
adjusted to conform with the frequency response of the human ear. A sound level meter that measures Aweighted
decibels, designated as dBA, has an electrical circuit that allows the meter to have the same
sensitivity to sound at different frequencies as the average human ear (2007, Australian Academy of
Science).
(2) Equivalent Noise Level (Leg). The dBA level of a steady state sound which has the same dBA weighted
sound energy as that contained in the actual time-varying sound being measured over a specific time
period (2003, Eilar Associates, Encinitas, CA).
(3) Ambient Noise Level. The average A-weighted Noise Level (Leq) at any specified point which is
representative of the noise level of that environment over an extended period. It is a composite of all
sounds from sources, both near and far.
(4) Noise Source. A single piece of equipment, or a collection of equipment under the control and operation
of a single entity (e.g., a wind farm), that produces noise because of its operation. A collection of
equipment may not necessarily be connected or related, if they may be operated simultaneously.
(5) Suspect Source. A Noise Source that may be in violation of this §420-48 identified by the nature of
sounds or a correlation with the times of operation and the alleged violation.
B. Limits.
(1) Ambient Noise Level Threshold.
(a) No noise source shall produce an A-Weighted Noise Level at any point in the Borough outside the
boundaries of the property on which the Noise Source is located (or in the case of a project
considered a single Noise Source, the boundaries of the collective project area) at a level in excess of
ten (10) dBA above the Ambient Noise Level.
(b) An increase in excess of ten (10) dBA shall be permitted provided the owner/operator of the Noise
Source acquires a noise easement in form and content approved by the Borough (solely with respect
to the noise easement) from the affected property owner which establishes the maximum increase.
However no increase shall be permitted for properties separated by any public road right of way and
in no case shall the maximum noise level exceed the level established by §420-48B(3).
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Standards: Page VII - 6
(2) Ambient Noise Level. For projects being developed, the Ambient Noise Level for the entire project may
be established prior to construction of such project for the duration of construction and operation of such
project by measuring the noise level near the boundaries of the property on which the project is to be
constructed in accord with §420-48C for a continuous two (2)-week period no more than two (2) years
prior to the start of construction of such project.

(3) Maximum Noise Level. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this §420-488, in no event
shall a Noise Source produce an A-Weighted Noise Level outside the boundaries of the property on
which the Noise Source is located (or in the case of a project considered a single Noise Source, the
boundaries of the collective project area) at a level in excess of the limits established in the Maximum
Sound Levels Table.
C. Measurements.
(1) Type and Certification. All noise level measurements shall be made using a sound level meter meeting
American National Standard Specification for Sound Level Meters (ANSI S1 .4-1983 (R2001 )/ANSI S1 .4A-
1985 or the current revision of that standard) for Type 1 instruments. The instrument shall have been
laboratory re-certified according to the manufacturer's directions within the periodicity required by the
manufacturer (usually 1- or 2-year interval) prior to the measurements.
(2) Methods. All measurements shall be taken using the FAST response time and A-weighting.
(3) Field Calibration. A field calibration check, using a certified field calibrator, shall be performed at the
beginning and end of the measurement period and reported with the other data.
(4) Proposed Projects.
(a) For projects establishing an Ambient Noise Level for the project prior to the approval of such project,
the average A-weighted Noise Level (Leq) shall be measured at multiple points near the outside
boundaries of the property on which the project is to be constructed for a continuous two-week period
no more than one (1) year to the start of construction of such project.
(b) Measurements should be attempted to be performed near outside boundaries which are closest in
proximity to where the Noise Source will be located and/or where noise is reasonably expected to be
the loudest.
(c) The measurements must be made by an independent professional using the commonly-accepted
measurement procedures specified in ANSI/ASA S1 .13-2005 (R2010) standard "American National
Standard Methods for the Measurement of Sound Pressure Levels In Air".
D. Investigation of Complaints.
(1) Initial Determination.
(a) In the event a complaint is received regarding a Suspect Source, the Zoning Officer shall first
determine that the complaint is valid by visiting the site of the complaint and the site of the Suspect
Source.
(b) If the nature of the sound at the site of the complaint is not similar to the nature of the sound
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Standards: Page VII - 7
produced by the Suspect Source, and if the subjective noise levels do not correlate with the operation
of the Suspect Source, then the Zoning Officer shall file a report noting those observations, and shall
notify the complainant and the owner/operator of the Suspect Source that the complaint has not been
validated.
(2) Test Date.
(a) If, by the nature of the sound, or correlation with the operation of the Suspect Source, the Zoning
Officer determines a complaint to potentially be valid, the Zoning Officer shall make a reasonable
effort to arrange a date and time with the complainant and the owner/operator of the Suspect Source
to conduct a test.
(b) The test should be close to the time of day and day of week of the complaint but shall not represent
an unreasonable burden on the complainant or the owner/operator of the Suspect Source.
(3) Background Noise Level.
(a) The Zoning Officer, or the Zoning officer's designee, shall conduct an average background Aweighted
Noise Level measurement before and after the operation of the Suspect Source using
commonly-accepted measurement equipment and standards; provided that at the election of the
owner/operator, the owner/operator may engage an independent professional to conduct such
measurements mutually agreed to by the Borough, at the cost of the owner/operator.
(b) At the direction of the Zoning Officer, or the Zoning officer's designee, the owner/operator of the
Suspect Source shall operate the equipment according to normal operating procedures according to
design limits, or the maximum approved limits of the conditional use approval, whichever is lower, for
the duration of the test.
(c) The owner/operator may be required to operate the equipment in any mode or for any use that the
equipment is normally or occasionally used. The owner/operator shall not be required to operate the
equipment in any manner inconsistent with the design or normal use, nor in any unsafe manner.
(4) Average Background A-weighted Noise Level.
(a) An average background A-weighted Noise Level shall be measured without the Suspect Source in
operation. The atmospheric conditions at the time of measurement shall be as near the atmospheric
conditions reported at the time of the complaint (wind direction and speed, temperature, temperature
gradient, etc.).
(b) Background activities shall be representative of those expected in the environment for the time of day
and day of the week.
(c) Measurements of the average background A-weighted Noise Level shall be made for the length of
time the Suspect Source will be in operation, but need not be any longer than fifteen (15) minutes. If
manual measurements are being taken, the measurements shall be recorded every fifteen (15)
seconds. If an automatic recording device is being used, the recording interval shall be one second,
or the closest fixed or variable interval allowed by the meter and recording equipment.
(5) Measurements.
(a) Measurements of the average A-weighted Noise Level (Leq) with the Suspect Source in operation
shall be conducted as soon as possible after obtaining the background noise level measurements
without the Suspect Source in operation and shall be made for the length of time the source will
normally be in operation, but in any case, shall not be less than five (5) minutes and need not be any
longer than 15 minutes.
(b) If manual measurements are being taken, the measurements shall be recorded every fifteen (15)
seconds. If an automatic recording device is being used, the recording interval shall be one (1)
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Standards: Page VII - 8
second, or the closest fixed or variable interval allowed by the meter and recording equipment.
(c) The equation for deducing the A-weighted Noise Level (Leq) being produced by the Suspect Source
(Ls) shall be as set forth below where L 1 equals the measured average A-weighted Noise Level (Leq)
of the background without the Suspect Source in operation and L2 equals the measured average Aweighted
Noise Level (Leq) of the background with the Suspect Source in operation. Basically, Ls
equals L2 minus L 1 as shown in log notation below which is the basis for decibel calculations.
E. Report. After completion of the background noise level measurements before and after the operation of the
Suspect Source, the report of the Zoning Officer, or the Zoning Officer's designee, (or the independent
professional, if engaged by the owner/operator of the Suspect Source) shall include:
(1) The instrument manufacturer, model, type, serial number, and laboratory re-certification date of the sound
level meter and the field calibrator.
(2) The level of the field calibration after making any adjustment of the sound level meter.
(3) The location of the noise level measurements, by latitude and longitude or by other descriptive terms that
would allow someone unfamiliar with the complaint to locate, unambiguously, the measurement point on
the ground, or on a map.
(4) The location of the Suspect Source by latitude and longitude or by other descriptive terms that would
allow someone unfamiliar with the complaint to locate, unambiguously, the measurement point on the
ground, or on a map.
(5) A description of the Suspect Source in operation, sufficient to allow someone to recreate the conditions of
the test.
(6) The weather conditions at the time of measurement, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed
and direction, cloud cover, and an impression of the temperature gradient.

F. Studies for Proposed Use.
(1) Compliance with Standards. Applicants for a specific proposed use shall be required to demonstrate that
the proposed use will not violate the standards in this §420-48 by providing reasonable documentary
evidence, which may include:
(a) Engineering studies which estimate the environmental noise levels from the proposed equipment
operations and the impact of mitigation measures applied to the equipment and/or site; and/or
(b) Environmental noise measurements from similar operations and sites (same number and types of
equipment, comparable topography and prevailing weather conditions).
(2) Loudspeakers. The applicant shall provide specifications for any proposed exterior loudspeakers and
detail how compliance will be attained.
(3) Conditions. Given the inherent vagaries of acoustic predictions and the variability of acoustic
measurements, the Borough Council may apply conditions which are more conservative than would be
indicated by the studies. In any case, the acceptance of proposed control or mitigation measures does
not relieve the applicant from complying with the standards provided in this §420-48 and/or any zoning
approval.
G. Exceptions. The standards in this §420-48 do not apply to:
(1) Radiated noise levels for vehicles or other operations subject to state or federal preemption.

§420-49 Vibration
Operating or permitting the operations of any device that creates vibration which is above the vibration perception
threshold of an individual at or beyond the property boundary of the source if on private property or at fifty (50)
feet from the source if on a public space or public right- of-way shall be prohibited. For the purposes of this
section, vibration perception threshold means the minimum ground-or- structure-borne vibrational motion
necessary to cause a normal person to be aware of the vibration by such direct means as, but not limited to,
sensation by touch or visual observation of moving objects.
§420-50 Lighting and Glare
The standards of this §420-50 shall also apply to residential and agricultural uses. Lighting shall be controlled in
both height and intensity to maintain community character; and lighting design should be an inherent part of the
project design. The applicant shall provide the specifications of the proposed lighting and its arrangement on the
site.
A. Purpose. To set standards for outdoor lighting to:
(1) Provide for and control lighting in outdoor places where public health, safety and welfare are potential
concerns;
(2) Protect drivers and pedestrians from the glare of non-vehicular light sources;
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Standards: Page VII -10
(3) Protect neighbors, the environment and the night sky from nuisance glare and light trespass from
improperly selected, placed, aimed, applied, maintained or shielded light sources; and
(4) Promote energy efficient lighting design and operation.
B. Applicability.
(1) This §420-50 shall apply to all uses within the Borough where there is exterior lighting that is viewed from
outside, including, but not limited to, residential, commercial, industrial, public and private
recreational/sports and institutional uses, and sign, billboard, architectural and landscape lighting.
(2) Exemptions. The following lighting applications are exempt from the requirements of this §420-50:
(a) Lighting within public right-of-way or easement for the principal purpose of illuminating streets or

the rated output of a standard non-directional 40-watt incandescent or 10-watt compact
fluorescent lamp, are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph. In the case of decorative
street lighting, luminaires that are fully shielded or comply with !ESNA cutoff criteria may be used.
(b) Non-horizontal Surfaces.
[1] For the lighting of predominantly non-horizontal surfaces such as, but not limited to, facades,
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Standards: Page VII - 11
landscaping, signs, billboards, fountains, displays and statuary, when their use is specifically
permitted by the Borough, luminaires shall be shielded and shall be installed and aimed so as to
not project their output into the windows of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, past the object
being illuminated, skyward or onto a public roadway.
[2] Luminaires with an aggregate rated lamp output not exceeding five hundred (500) lumens, e.g.,
the rated output of a standard non-directional 40-watt incandescent or 10-watt compact
fluorescent lamp, are exempt from the requirements of this §420-50C(2)(b ).
(3) Control of Glare.
(a) All lighting shall be aimed, located, designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard to
drivers or pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely traverse and so as not to create a nuisance
by projecting or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or property.
(b) Directional luminaires such as floodlights and spotlights shall be so shielded, installed and aimed that
they do not project their output into the windows of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, past the
object being illuminated, skyward or onto a public roadway or pedestrian way. Floodlights installed
above grade on residential properties, except when motion-sensor actuated, shall not be aimed out
more than 45 degrees from straight down. When a floodlight creates glare as viewed from an
adjacent residential property, the floodlight shall be required to be re-aimed and/or fitted with a
shielding device to block the view of the glare source from that property.
(c) Barn lights, also known as dusk-to-dawn lights, when a source of glare as viewed from an adjacent
property, shall not be permitted unless effectively shielded as viewed from that property.
(d) Reserved
(e) Parking facility and vehicular and pedestrian-way lighting (except for safety and security applications

extinguished after the close of business or facility operation. When safety or security lighting is
proposed for after-hours illumination, it shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the number of
luminaires or illumination level required or permitted for illumination during regular business hours.
When it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Borough that an elevated security risk exists,
e.g., a history of relevant crime, an appropriate increase above the twenty-five (25) percent limit may
be permitted as a conditional use.
(f) Luminaires shall be automatically controlled using a programmable controller with battery poweroutage
reset, which accommodates daily and weekly variations in operating hours, annual time
changes and seasonal variations in hours of darkness. The use of photocells is permitted when in
combination with the programmable controller to turn luminaires on at dusk and also for all-night
safety/security dusk-to-dawn luminaire operation when such lighting is specifically approved by the
Borough in accord with §420-48C(3)(e). The use of motion detectors is permitted.
(g) Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary means for controlling glare. Rather,
glare control shall be achieved primarily using such means as cutoff luminaires, shields and baffles,
and appropriate application of luminaire mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and luminaire
placement.
(h) Light Spillover.
(1) Residential. The illumination projected from any use onto a residential use or permanent open
space shall at no time exceed 0.1 initial footcandle, measured line-of-sight at any time and from
any point on the receiving residential property. This shall include glare from digital or other
illuminated signs
(2) Nonresidential. The illumination projected from any property onto a non-residential use shall at

property
(I) Height. Except as permitted for certain recreational lighting and permitted elsewhere in this
paragraph, luminaires shall not be mounted more than twenty (20) feet above finished grade (AFG) of
the surface being illuminated. Luminaires not meeting full-cutoff criteria, when their use is specifically
permitted by the Borough, shall not be mounted more than 16 feet AFG. Mounting height shall be
defined as the distance from the finished grade of the surface being illuminated to the optical center
of the luminaire. Where proposed parking lots consist of 100 or more contiguous spaces, the Borough
may, at its discretion, based partially on mitigation of potential off-site impacts, permit a luminaire
mounting height not to exceed twenty-five (25) feet AFG. For maximum mounting height of
recreational lighting, see §420-480.
U) The United States, state and other official flags may be illuminated from dusk to dawn. All other flags
shall not be illuminated past 11 :00 p.m. Flag lighting sources shall not exceed seven thousand
(7,000) aggregate lamp lumens per flagpole. The light source shall have a beam spread no greater
than necessary to illuminate the flag.
(k) Under-canopy lighting for such applications as gas/service stations, hotel/theater marquees, fastfood/
bank/drugstore drive-ups, shall be accomplished using flat-lens full-cutoff luminaires aimed
straight down and shielded in such a manner that the lowest opaque edge of the luminaire shall be
below the light source and its light-directing surfaces, at all lateral angles around the luminaire. The
average illumination intensity in the area directly below the canopy shall not exceed 20 maintained
footcandles and the maximum density shall not exceed thirty (30) initial footcandles.
(I) Soffit lighting around building exteriors shall not exceed fifteen (15) initial footcandles.

radio/communications towers is prohibited during hors of darkness except as required by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
(4) Installation.
(a) Electrical feeds for lighting standards shall be run underground, not overhead, and shall be in accord
with the National Electric Code (NEC) Handbook.
(b) Poles supporting luminaires for the illumination of parking areas and located within the parking area
or directly behind parking spaces, or where they could be hit by snow plows or wide-swinging
vehicles, shall be protected by being placed a minimum of five (5) feet outside paved area or tire
stops, or placed on concrete pedestals at least thirty (30) inches high above the pavement, shielded
by steel bollards or protected by other effective means.
(c) Pole mounted luminaires for lighting horizontal surfaces shall be aimed straight down and poles shall
be plumb.
(d) Poles and brackets for supporting luminaires shall be those specifically manufactured for that purpose
and shall be designed and rated for the luminaire and mounting accessory weights and wind loads
involved.
(e) Pole foundations shall be designed consistent with manufacturer's wind load requirements and local
soil conditions involved.
(5) Maintenance. Luminaires and ancillary equipment shall be maintained to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
(6) Billboards and Signs. The lighting of new or relighting of existing billboards and signs shall require a
permit, which shall be granted when the Zoning Officer is satisfied that excessive illumination, light
pollution, glare and light trespass have been adequately mitigated, and shall be subject to the following
requirements:
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Standards: Page VII -13
(a) Externally illuminated billboards and signs shall have luminaires mounted at the top of the billboard or
sign and aimed downward. The luminaires shall be designed, fitted and aimed to shield the lamp and
its reflective surfaces from off-site view and to place the light output onto and not beyond the sign or
billboard. Lighting shall be by linear fluorescent unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Borough that such a mounting arrangement is not possible. At no point on the face of the sign or
billboard and at no time shall the illumination exceed thirty (30) vertical footcandles during hours of
darkness.
(b) Internally illuminated signs shall have a dark field and light message. The aggregate output of the
light sources shall not exceed 500 initial lumens per square foot of sign face per side.

permitted.
D. Recreational Uses. The nighttime illumination of outdoor recreational facilities for such sports as baseball,
basketball, soccer, tennis, track and field, and football typically necessitate higher than normally permitted
luminaire mounting heights and aiming angles, utilize very high-wattage lamps and potentially produce
unacceptable levels of light trespass and glare when located near residential properties. Permission to
illuminate such facilities shall be granted only when the Borough is satisfied that the health, safety and welfare
rights of nearby property owners and the Borough have been properly protected. When recreational uses are
specifically permitted by the Borough for operation during hours of darkness, the following requirements shall
apply:
(1) Race tracks and such recreational venues as golf driving ranges and trap-shooting facilities that
necessitate the horizontal or near horizontal aiming of luminaires and projection of illumination, may be
permitted by conditional use. A visual impact analysis shall be required in accord with §420-480(6).
(2) A proposed illuminated recreational facility located within a R-1 or R-2 District or sited on a nonresidential
property located within 1,000 feet of a property in a R-1 or R-2 District shall be considered a conditional
use ..
(3) Sporting events shall be timed to end at such time that all lighting in the sports facility, other than lighting
for safe exit of patrons, shall be extinguished by 10:00 p.m. except in the occurrence of extra innings,
overtimes or make-up games.
(4) The Borough reserves the right to limit the number of illuminated sporting events per week or season.

§420-67 Special Conservation Standards
All uses permitted by this chapter shall be subject to the following special conservation performance standards
which shall apply to any lands that are characterized as steep slopes, wetlands or flood plains, except that these
provisions do not apply where the applicant proposes to join two (2) existing parcels into a single parcel, or to
subdivide a parcel from one parcel and join that with an adjoining tract of land, and where no new development is
proposed on the resulting lots. The procedures and standards are as follows:
A. Steep Slope Areas. Steep slopes shall be defined as slopes exceeding twenty-five (25) percent e as
determined by the Zoning Officer, from United States Geological Survey topographic maps or USDA NRCS
maps. In cases where the slope cannot be specifically determined by said means, the Zoning Officer may
require the applicant to provide certification from a Qualified Professional of the slope in question. Slope shall
be measured at the points where any earth will be disturbed or where structures or other improvements are
proposed. Any use or development of such steep slope areas shall be considered a conditional use, and in
reviewing applications for use of sites partially or wholly included within an area identified as steep-sloped, the
Borough Council and Planning Commission shall be satisfied that the following performance standards have
been or will be met:
(1) An accurate map prepared by a Qualified Professional has been submitted showing property boundaries,
building and drive locations, contours at two (2) foot intervals and any areas to be graded. The proposed
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Standards: Page VII -19
location of other factors shall also be shown including streams, wetlands, areas subject to landslides and
extent of vegetative cover.
(2) A grading and drainage plan has been prepared showing existing and proposed ground surfaces, plans
for drainage devices, plans for walls or cribbing, etc., map of the drainage area affected, computation of
the amount of runoff expected, an erosion control plan and schedule for completion of work.
(3) No finished grade where fill is used shall exceed a slope of three (3) feet horizontal to one (1) foot
vertical.
(4) Where fill is used to later support structures, a minimum compaction of ninety (90) percent of maximum
density shall be achieved.
(5) Soils characterized by the Soil Conservation Service as highly susceptible to erosion shall be avoided.
(6) Roads and utilities shall be installed along existing contours to the greatest extent possible.
(7) steep slope areas also characterized by seasonal high water tables shall be avoided.
(8) Removal of, or disturbance to, existing vegetation on the site shall be minimized. The proposed impacts
on existing vegetation shall be evaluated in terms of the potentially detrimental effects on slope stability,
erosion potential, transpiration and recharge of stormwater, aesthetic and traditional characteristics of the
landscape, and existing drainage patterns. Mitigation measures may be required by the Board as it
deems appropriate.
(9) In cases where structures are proposed, the applicant shall submit plans to the Zoning Officer detailing
how the limitations of slope will be mitigated by the design of the structure(s).
B. Wetlands.
(1) Identification.
(a) Delineation. If the Borough reasonably anticipates that wetlands may be present or may be impacted
by the proposed development, the Borough may require wetlands, as defined and regulated by the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be delineated and shown on any application proposing a new use or
expanded use of land.
(b) Applicant Responsibility. The Applicant shall be responsible for said delineation and supply to the
Borough a written report from the individual, partnership, corporation or other entity which performed
the wetlands delineation fully describing the methodology used. Notwithstanding receipt of such
delineation and report, the Borough may require the Applicant to submit, at no cost to the Borough,
an additional wetlands delineation of the site and report as to methodology, from a second source for
purposes of verification. In the event of discrepancy between delineations, the Applicant shall obtain a
jurisdictional determination.
(c) Jurisdictional Determination. The Borough may also require that the applicant obtain a Jurisdictional
Determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
(d) Certification of No Wetlands. If no wetlands are present, the applicant shall provide a certified
statement to that effect.
(2) State or Federal Compliance - No zoning approval granted by the Borough shall in any manner be
construed to be an approval of compliance by the applicant with any State or Federal wetland regulations;
and the Borough shall have no liability or responsibility to the applicant or any other person for
compliance with said regulations.

STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC USES
In addition to all other applicable standards in this chapter, the standards in this Article VIII, which may include larger
lot sizes, increased setbacks and other standards more restrictive than established by other sections, shall apply to
the uses as provided in the following sections. The omission from a section of a reference to other applicable
requirements shall not exempt compliance with those requirements.
§420-73 Adult Businesses
A. Findings. In adopting these standards which apply to adult businesses, the Borough has made the following
findings in regard to the secondary effects on the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Borough. The
findings are based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community
presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Borough, and on findings incorporated in the cases of
City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters. Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 427 U.S. 50
(1976), and Northend Cinema, Inc., v. Seattle, 585 P. 2d 1153 (Wash. 1978), and on studies in other communities
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Manatee County,
Florida; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Austin Texas; Seattle,
Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Beaumont, Texas; and New York City, New York; and also on findings
found in the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses,
June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota.
(1) Health Concerns. The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern which
demands reasonable regulation of adult businesses and adult uses in order to protect the health and wellbeing
of the citizens.
(2) Behavior. Certain employees of sexually oriented business regulated by this chapter as adult theaters and
cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain types of sexually oriented behavior at these businesses than
employees of other establishments.
(3) Sexual Acts. Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses,
especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex
shows, as regulated by this chapter as adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, adult motion
picture theaters, or adult arcades.
(4) Unhealthy Conditions. Offering and providing such space, encourages such activities, which create unhealthy
conditions.
(5) Sexual Activities. Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented
businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
(6) Communicable Diseases. At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in
sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus
infection (AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections;
and, the incidence of many of these diseases is on the increase.
(7) Unhealthy Conditions. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part,
because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the
activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and
maintain those facilities.
(8) Bodily Fluids. Numerous studies and reports. have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually
oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films.
(9) Accountability. Classifying adult businesses as conditional uses is a reasonable means of accountability to
ensure that operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and conditions, and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
2018-09

solicitation.
(10) Externalities. There is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses, because of their very nature,
have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, causing increased crime, the downgrading of property values, and the decline of the
overall character of the community. A number of municipal studies, including the 1986 Austin, Texas study,
have demonstrated this.
(11) Operational Characteristics. It is generally recognized that adult businesses, due to their nature, have
serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are located in close proximity to
each other, thereby contributing to neighborhood blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent
area. A number of municipal studies, including the 1986 Austin, Texas study, have demonstrated this.
(12) Reason for Control. The Borough desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and
thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry, protect the citizens from increased crime;
preserve the quality of life, preserve property values and the character of the surrounding community.
B. Intent. It is the intent of this §420-73 to:
(1) Secondary Effects. Regulate adult business in order to promote the public health, safety and welfare by
minimizing the secondary effects on the community which are associated with such businesses, and which
include difficulties for law enforcement, trash disposal, deleterious effects on business and residential property
values, increased crime (particularly the corruption of morals of minors and prostitution), and drive residents
and businesses to move elsewhere.
(2) Zoning District. Designate a zoning district where adult businesses are permitted, and establish reasonable,
content neutral standards applicable to such uses.
(3) Content. Have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials including sexually oriented or adult materials.
(4) First Amendment. Not totally restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or adult materials
protected by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution.
(5) Intended Market. Not deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market.

§420-96 Mineral Extraction Including Oil and Gas Development
In addition to other applicable standards of this chapter, this §420-96 shall apply to mineral extraction including oil and
gas well operations.
A. Findings. The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code clearly recognizes mineral extraction as a lawful use.
Along with other community effects, such uses can have impacts on water supply sources and are governed by
state statutes that specify replacement and restoration of affected water supplies. Planning Code Section 603(1)
states that zoning ordinances shall provide for the reasonable development of minerals in each municipality. The
Code definition of minerals is: Any aggregate or mass of mineral matter, whether or not coherent. The term
includes, but is not limited to, limestone and dolomite, sand and gravel, rock and stone, earth, fill, slag, iron ore,
zinc ore, vermiculite and clay, anthracite and bituminous coal, coal refuse, peat and crude oil and natural gas. The
Code, at Section 603(b) allows zoning ordinances to regulate mineral extraction, but only to the extent that such
uses are not regulated by the state Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act, the Noncoal Surface
Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act, and the Oil and Gas Act.
B. Intent; Oil and Gas.
(1) Intent. The intent of this section is to ensure the Borough is supplied with all necessary information for making

(1) Location Requirement and Number . The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough,
using technological evidence, that the WCF and support structure must go where it is proposed, in order to
satisfy its function in the company's grid system. The number of WCF to be installed at a site by an applicant
may not exceed the current minimum necessary to ensure the adequacy of current service required by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license held by that applicant. The applicant shall provide
information on the general location of other towers/sites planned for the region.
(2) Collocation; New Tower. If the applicant proposes to build a tower (as opposed to mounting the WCF on an
existing structure), the Borough may require the applicant to demonstrate that it contacted, in writing, the
owners of tall structures within a one- mile radius of the site proposed, asked for permission to install the WCF
on those structures, and was denied. This would include smoke stacks, water towers, tall buildings, WCF
support structures of other cellular phone companies, other communications towers (fire, police, etc.) and
other tall structures. The Borough may deny the application to construct a new tower if the applicant has not
made a good faith effort to mount the WCF on an existing structure, thereby documenting that there exists no
other support structure which can reasonably serve the needs of the owner of the proposed WCF. A good
faith effort shall demonstrate that one or more of the following reasons apply to a particular structure:
(a) The proposed equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing structure; and, its
reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a reasonable cost.
(b) The proposed equipment would cause radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for that
existing structure; and, the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Such existing structures do not have adequate location, space, access or height to accommodate the
proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended function.
(d) Addition of the proposed equipment would result in electromagnetic radiation from such structure
exceeding applicable standards established by the Federal Communications Commission governing
human exposure to electromagnetic radiation.
(e) A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with the owners of such structures.
(3) WCF Height; Airport Zoning; Design.
(a) The applicant shall demonstrate that the WCF is at the minimum height required to function satisfactorily
and provide adequate height for eight service providers. The maximum height of any WCF shall be two
hundred (200) feet.
(b) The Borough may require the tower to be designed and constructed to be stackable (structurally capable
of being increased in height} so that additional antenna arrays can be accommodated in addition to the
arrays on the original tower to facilitate future collocation.
(c} WCF equipment buildings shall comply with the accessory structure height limitations of the applicable
Zoning District.
( d) The Borough shall require stealth design or specific colors to ensure that the WCF is compatible with the
surrounding landscape; and, such determination shall be based on a balloon test for height conducted
by the applicant.
(4) Setbacks. If a new WCF support structure is constructed (as opposed to mounting the WCF on an existing
structure) or if the WCF height exceeds the height of the existing structure on which it is mounted by more
than twenty (20) feet, the following minimum setbacks shall apply.
2018-09

is mounted on an existing structure. The fence shall be a minimum of eight feet in height.
(8) Landscaping. Landscaping may be required to screen as much of the support structure as possible, the fence
surrounding the support structure, any other ground level features (such as a building), and, in general, buffer
the WCF and support structure site from neighboring properties. The Borough may permit any combination
of existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping, if they
achieve the same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If the WCF is mounted on an existing
structure and other equipment is housed inside an existing structure, landscaping shall not be required. In
addition, existing vegetation on and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
(9) Collocation; Other Uses. In order to reduce the number of WCF support structures needed in the community
in the future, the proposed support structure for a new tower facility shall be required to accommodate other

§420-119 General Provisions
A. Purpose.
ARTICLE IX
NONCONFORMITIES
Nonconformities: Page IX-1
(1) To recognize that if, prior to the adoption of this chapter, as amended,, property was used for a then lawful
purpose or in a then lawful manner which this chapter would render thereafter prohibited and nonconforming,
such property is generally held to have acquired a vested right to continue such nonconforming use or
nonconforming structure. Nevertheless, this does not preclude the Borough from regulating the change,
alteration, reconstruction, reestablishment, extension, destruction and abandonment of nonconforming uses
in accord with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code and general case law.
(2) To limit the injurious impact of nonconforming uses and/or structures on other adjacent properties within a
particular district and the community as a whole, while recognizing that the change, alteration, reconstruction,
reestablishment, or extension of nonconforming uses and/or structures may not be contrary to the public
interest or the general purpose of this chapter.
(3) To prescribe those standards which are to be applied by the Borough in determining the reasonableness of
a proposal to change, alter, reconstruct, reestablish, or extend a non-conforming use. The following are
regulations which shall apply.
B. Applicability. The provisions and protections of this Article IX shall apply only to those nonconforming lots,
structures and uses which legally preexisted the applicable provisions of this chapter, as amended, or which are
recognized by §420-121 or §420-122. Any lot, structure or use created, constructed or established after the
effective date of the original zoning ordinance, as amended, reenacted and replaced, which does not conform to
the applicable requirements shall be considered an illegal lot, structure or use subject to the penalties prescribed
by this chapter, and the said lot, structure or use shall not be entitled to any of the protections afforded to legal,
pre-existing nonconforming lots, structures or uses.
C. Registration. It shall be the responsibility of the party asserting a nonconformity to provide the evidence that the
nonconformity is legal. A property owner may request a written statement of nonconformity from the Zoning Officer
after providing sufficient evidence.
D. Continuation, Sale and Change. A lawful nonconforming lot, structure or use as defined by this chapter may be
continued and may be sold and be continued by new owners. Any expansion, alteration, extension or change in
a nonconformity shall only proceed in compliance with this Article.
§420-120 Definitions
A. Nonconforming Lot. Any lot which does not conform with the minimum width, depth and area dimensions specified
for the district where such a lot is situated, such lot having been created and recorded in the office of the County
Recorder of Deeds prior to the effective date of this chapter, as amended.

For the purposes of this Article IX, a building, structure or use, legally permitted, planned and substantially under
construction in compliance with existing regulations prior to the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment
hereto, and completed within a one-year period after the effective date of this chapter or amendment hereto, shall be
considered nonconforming.
§420-122 Nonconformities by Variance
A building, structure or use allowed by variance in a district where it is non-conforming with any regulations of this
chapter, as amended, reenacted and replaced, shall be considered nonconforming for the purposes of this chapter.
§420-123 Maintenance; Condemned Structures
A. Maintenance. Normal maintenance and repair, such as painting, replacement of siding, and similar activities is
allowed, as well as those interior renovations which do not structurally alter the building or area or result in
increased use of the building or area, or a change of nonconforming, or otherwise create more incompatibility with
the surrounding permitted uses. Such maintenance and repair activities shall, however, shall comply with all other
applicable standards and permit requirements of this chapter.
B. Condemned Structures. A nonconforming structure which has been legally condemned shall not be rebuilt or used
except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
§420-124 Changes of Nonconforming Uses
A. Special Exceptions. All changes of nonconforming uses shall be considered special exceptions subject to the
specific procedures and review criteria contained in §420-163.
(1) More Restrictive Classification. A nonconforming use may only be changed to a use of equal or less
nonconformity (i.e. more restrictive classification)as determined by the Planning Commission and Zoning
Hearing Board in accord with classification of the uses in the Schedule of Uses.
(2) General Standard. The general standard shall be that no change of a nonconforming use shall be permitted
if such change will result in the establishment of a use which is materially different from the existing use in
terms of negative affects on the community and the long term application of this chapter to eliminate
incompatible uses from specific zoning districts. (For example, a change from a nonconforming retail store
in an R-1 Residential District to a bank may be permitted; however, a change to a manufacturing use would
not be permitted.)
B. Conforming Changes and Conversions.
(1) Change. A change in a nonconforming use to a conforming use shall not be considered a special exception
unless the proposed use is classified as a special exception by the Schedule of Uses. A change of a
nonconforming use to a conforming use shall be considered an abandonment of the nonconforming use which
shall not thereafter revert to a nonconforming use.
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Nonconformities: Page IX-3
(2) Conversion. The conversion of a nonconforming use to a nonconforming use of like classification shall not
be considered a special exception. For example, a nonconforming retail establishment selling groceries
proposed for conversion to a shoe store would not be considered a change in nonconforming use.
§420-125 Extension of Nonconforming Uses
A. Special Exceptions. All extensions of nonconforming uses into more area of a structure or onto more area of
property shall be considered special exceptions subject to the specific procedures and review criteria contained
in §420-163.
B. Extension onto Other Properties of Record in the Same Ownership; New Structures. Extensions of a
nonconforming use shall be limited to the same parcel of property on which the nonconforming use is situated as
said parcel existed on record at the time of the adoption of this chapter. For any nonconforming uses not involving
a nonconforming structure, no new structures shall be permitted as part of an extension.
C. Extension Limitation. An extension of land or structure utilized for the nonconforming use shall be limited to a total
increase not to exceed fifty (50) percent of land and fifty (50) percent of structure beyond what existed at the time
the use became nonconforming. All such extensions of a nonconforming use may be permitted in successive
increments for a total up to the increase permitted; and each increment shall be a separate application.
Applications for successive increments shall only be entertained by the Borough upon the completion of the
previously approved addition or extension.
D. Prohibited Extensions. Should the use proposed for extension be one which is specifically prohibited as a new
use in the Borough or is a use judged by the Zoning hearing Board to be one similar to such a use or of such a
nature as to impose health, safety or welfare concerns which cannot be satisfied by the imposition of the conditions
permitted under this chapter, the requested extension shall be denied. The Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
past operating performance in making its decision.
E. Increase in Area or Bulk Nonconformity. In the case where a proposed extension of a nonconforming structure
will result in an increased nonconformity of setback, height, lot coverage or other area or bulk standard, a variance
shall be required from the Zoning Hearing Board except as provided in §420-128C.
§420-126 Restoration of Structure or Use
A Limit for Restoration. When fifty (50) percent or less of the existing floor area or volume of a nonconforming
building or use of land is destroyed by fire, other casualty or act of God, or when such building is destroyed or
demolished because of condemnation as a fire hazard, the use or reconstruction of such building or land as
existed as a nonconforming use prior to said destruction or condemnation shall be permitted provided:
(1) The application for a zoning and building permit is submitted and the reconstruction is completed within
twenty-four (24) months of the date of the casualty.
(2) The nonconformity is not increased and no new nonconformity is created.
(3) It was not voluntarily demolished. (See §420-1260.)
(4) The damage does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the existing floor area or volume of the nonconforming
building or use of land.
B. Procedure. Permits. All applicable permits for the reconstruction of a nonconforming use shall be required. Such
reconstruction shall be considered a special exception if the reconstruction involves a change or extension of use
as regulated by §420-124 and §420-125, respectively.
C. Extension. The Zoning Officer may, for good cause shown by the owner, grant a one-time extension of.not more
than one (1) year for the restoration. Said extension shall only be considered upon written application for same
submitted by the property owner.
D. Demolition. If a nonconforming structure or use of land is voluntarily demolished to an extent which exceeds fifty
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Nonconformities: Page IX-4
(50) percent of the cost to replace the entire structure or use in accord with the most current construction
standards, the reconstruction shall comply with current setback, lot coverage, height and other requirements of
this Article.
§420-127 Abandonment and Reestablishment of Nonconformities
A. Abandonment. Unless extended in accord with §420-127B, if a nonconforming use of land or structure ceases
operations, is discontinued, is vacated or is otherwise abandoned for a period of one (1) year or more, then this
shall be deemed to be an intent to abandon such nonconforming use and any subsequent use of the land or
structure shall be for conforming purposes only and said use shall in all respects conform to the applicable
provisions of this chapter. A change of a nonconforming use to a conforming use shall be considered an
abandonment of the nonconforming use which shall not thereafter revert to a nonconforming use.
B. Extension. The Zoning Officer may for good cause grant a one-time extension of not more than one (1) year for
the reestablishment of a nonconforming use of land or structure. Said extension shall only be considered by the
Zoning Officer upon written application for same submitted by the property owner.
§420-128 Alterations and Expansions of Nonconforming Structures
A. Alterations. The alteration or expansion of nonconforming structures shall be permitted only in accord with this
§420-128.
B. Procedure and Permits. All applicable permits for the alteration or expansion of a nonconforming structure shall
be required. Such alteration or expansion shall be considered a special exception if the alteration or expansion
involves a change or extension of a nonconforming use as regulated by §420-124 and §420-125, respectively.
C. Increase in Area or Bulk Nonconformity. In the case where a proposed alteration or expansion of a nonconforming
structure will result in an increased nonconformity of setback, height, lot coverage or other area or bulk standard,
a variance shall be required from the Zoning Hearing Board except as follows: A one-time alteration of a structure
shall be permitted to extend along the nonconforming setback line a distance not to exceed fifty (50) percent of
the nonconforming length of the structure. However, the height of any such extension shall not exceed the lesser
of the existing height of the nonconforming structure or the applicable district maximum height, and the maximum
lot coverage shall not be exceeded.
§420-129 Use of Nonconforming Lots of Record
A. Single-family Dwelling.
(1) Principal Permitted Use. In any district where single-family residences are permitted, a single-family dwelling
and accessory buildings and uses may be erected as a principal permitted use on any lawfully existing
nonconforming lot of record even though the lot area is less than the minimum requirements for the district.
(2) Standards. Side and rear setbacks, but not front setbacks, may be reduced by the same ratio as the lot is
nonconforming as to area, but no side or rear setback shall be reduced to less than ten (10) feet. This shall
not apply to any required wetland, waterbody or watercourse setback or buffer, and all other district
requirements shall apply. (See §420-22 for accessory structures.)
(3) Adjacent Lots. Where two (2) or more adjacent lots with less than the required area are held by one (1)
owner, the request for a zoning permit shall be considered a special exception and shall be referred to the
Zoning Hearing Board which may require the owner of said lots to combine the lots or realign lot lines to create
a lot or lots that conform, or conform as nearly as possible (where total conformance is impossible), with the
applicable requirements for lot dimensions and area.
B. Nonresidential Uses. A nonresidential use and accessory buildings and uses may be developed on any lawfully
existing nonconforming lot where permitted by the Schedule of Uses provided:
(1) Standards. All setbacks normally required in the district are maintained and all other applicable standards in
this chapter are satisfied.
2018-09
Borough of West Hazleton Zoning Ordinance Nonconformities: Page IX-5
(2) Lot Size Requirement. This chapter does not require a lot size for the specific use which is greater than the
lot size for the district.
§420-130 Review Factors
In addition to all other applicable requirements, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider any nonconformity special
exception application in terms of the effect on the following factors:
A. Nuisance Considerations.
(1) Traffic generation
(2) Noise, dust, fumes, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire and explosion hazards and other nuisances.
(3) Amount and nature of outdoor storage.
(4) Hours of operation.
(5) Compatibility with the character of the surrounding neighborhood
(6) Potential of the expansion to reduce existing congestion and alleviate parking shortages by improved site
design, addition of parking and improved loading areas.
B. Specific Considerations.
(1) Neighborhood Character. The proposed change will be less objectionable in external effects than the previous
nonconforming use and will be more consistent physically with its surroundings and neighborhood.
(2) Storage of Materials. There shall be no increase in the amount of materials, supplies and/or products that are
stored outside a nonconforming facility except in accord with those types of uses outlined in §420-130B(3).
(3) Screening. Where the non-conforming activity is one which necessarily results in the storage of large
quantities of material, supplies or products outside (such as a sawmill, farm machinery sales operation or
similar operation), the use may only be expanded if a solid fence of wood and/or buffer, not less than six (6)
feet in height, is present on all sides of the immediate area in use. Stored material shall not exceed the height
of the screening material and nine (9) feet at the maximum. Setbacks and buffers shall be provided in accord
with §420-43.
(4) Setbacks. No addition, change or expansion of a non-conforming use shall further violate setback and/or
height regulations of the district in which it is located
(5) Parking and Access. In no case will a change, addition or expansion of a non-conforming use be allowed
which would result in the diversion of traffic, or relocation of a driveway on the site to any point nearer a
residential property, or result in violation of any of the parking and unloading requirements of this chapter. The
Borough may require vegetative screening of the parking area from nearby residential areas in accord with
§420-43.
(6) Average Daily Traffic. The applicant shall show how the proposed change will affect Average Daily Traffic
(ADT) pursuant to the standards set forth in the most current Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute
of Transportation Engineers, or its successor. If ADT will increase the applicant shall document to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board how any community impacts will be addressed.

(2) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be
2018-09

developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property; and,

property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent

Council or, with the approval of the Borough Council, an officer of the municipality, or any aggrieved owner or
tenant of real property who shows that his property or person will be substantially affected by the alleged violation,
in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or
abate such building, structure or land, or to prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use
constituting a violation. When any such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice of that action shall be
served upon the Borough at least thirty (30) days prior to the time the action is begun by serving a copy of the
complaint on the Borough Council. No such action may be maintained until such notice has been given.

Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the District Magisterial Judge determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this Chapter
to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one
such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the District Magisterial
Judge and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments,
costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid over to the Borough.

the Borough, the right to commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this §420-172.
