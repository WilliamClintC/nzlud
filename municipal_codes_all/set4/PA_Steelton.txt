occasions a conflict of interest relating to his duties as Borough
Solicitor; and in no case will said officer, official or employee be liable

subject to unwarranted invasion of privacy and except that all evidence
or information obtained in the course of any inspection or investigation
shall be considered privileged information and shall be kept
confidential. Such evidence or information or other investigative
materials shall not be disclosed except as may be necessary in the

Enforcement Officer and other personnel may consist of employees
directly hired and compensated by the Borough of Steelton.
B. Fire Chief. In accordance with the Fire Prevention Code of the Borough
of Steelton,2 the Fire Chief or Chiefs of the Borough have been

Enforcement of the Borough of Steelton, having, in conjunction with the
Code Enforcement Officer, all of the duties of enforcement of the Fire
Prevention Code of the Borough provided for in this chapter. The Fire
Chief or Chiefs shall continue to serve in the capacity until such time as
Council declares otherwise. The Fire Chief shall be subordinate to the

make all the required inspections or may accept reports of inspections
by authoritative and recognized services or individuals, which satisfy
requirements as to qualifications and reliability. All inspection reports
shall be in writing and shall be certified by the approved authority or
responsible officer of the agency or the individual when expert
inspection services are accepted. The Code Enforcement Officer may
engage such expert opinion as may be deemed necessary to report upon
unusual technical issues that may arise subject to the approval of the
appointing authority. When required by the provisions of the codes or
by the approved rules, materials or assemblies shall be inspected at the
point of manufacture or fabrication.

§ 2-2 § 2-4

applicable codes and ordinances which establish the Office of Code
Enforcement as their official administration and enforcement authority.
B. Duties. The duties of the Code Enforcement Officer shall include the
receipt of applications; the issuance of permits, notices, certificates and
orders; the making of inspections to determine conformance with
applicable codes and ordinances; the undertaking of research and
investigations; the recommendation of appropriate administrative rules
for review and adoption by the Code Hearing Board; the keeping of
records; the issuance of written annual reports; and such other
activities as may be required.
C. Credentials. The Code Enforcement Officer or his authorized
representative shall disclose proper credentials of their respective
office for the purpose of inspecting any and all buildings and premises
in the performance of duties under the applicable code and/or
ordinances where requested.
D. Coordination of enforcement. Whenever, in the opinion of the Code
Enforcement Officer, initiating an inspection under the applicable codes
and/or ordinances, it is deemed necessary or desirable to have
inspections by any other department, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall make reasonable effort to arrange for the coordination of such
inspections so as to minimize the number of visits by Borough officials
and to confer with the other departments for the purpose of eliminating
conflicting orders before any are issued. The assistance and
cooperation of all other municipal officials, including the Police and Fire
Departments, shall be available to the Code Enforcement Officer to
assist in the performance of his duties.
E. Right of entry. Except in the case of any emergency or a mutually
convenient time agreed to by the Code Enforcement Officer and the
owner, the Code Enforcement Officer or his authorized representative,
in discharging his duties and upon showing proper identification where
requested, is hereby authorized to enter and inspect between the hours
of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. any structure or premises in the Borough of
Steelton to enforce the provisions of this chapter and of those other
applicable codes and ordinances. Every occupant of a structure or
premises shall give the owner or operator thereof, or agent or
employee, access to any part of such structure or its premises at
reasonable times for the purpose of making such inspection,
maintenance, repairs or alterations as are necessary to comply with the
provisions of this Code.

in charge fails or refuses to permit entry and free access to the
structure or premises under his control, or to any part thereof, with

may, upon showing that probable cause exists for the inspection,
petition for and obtain an ex parte order directing compliance with the
inspection requirements of this chapter from a court of competent

§ 2-5. Certain permits required; applications for permits; issuance
or denial.
jurisdiction, including a District Justice. Any person who refuses to
comply with such an order issued pursuant to this section shall be
subject to such penalties as may be authorized by law for violation of a
court order.
G. Rule-making authority. The Borough Code Enforcement Officer shall
have the power as may be necessary in the interest of public safety,
health and general welfare to interpret the intent of the applicable
codes in specific cases where it clearly appears that, by reason of
special conditions, undue hardship would result from a literal
application of any section of the applicable codes. Where such undue
hardship clearly appears, the Borough Code Enforcement Officer may
permit a variance from the literal provisions of the code, but such
variance shall not have the effect of waiving working stresses or fire
protection requirements specifically provided in the code or violating
accepted engineering practice involving public safety, but will comply
with the spirit and intent of the code. All variances granted shall,
however, be reported in writing to the Code Hearing Board at the end of
the month in which they occur.
H. Preliminary inspections. Before issuing a permit, the Code Enforcement
Officer may examine or cause to be examined all buildings, structures
and sites for which an application has been filed for a permit to
construct, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, demolish or change the use
thereof. This section shall not apply to, or be interpreted as affecting,
any provisions, terms, conditions or requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance or regulations of the Borough.3
I. Required inspections. After issuing a permit, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall conduct such inspections from time to time during and
upon completion of the work for which a permit has been issued. A
record of all such examinations and inspections and of all violations of
this Code shall be maintained by the Code Enforcement Officer. Upon
completion of the building or structure, and before issuance of the
certificate of use and occupancy, a final inspection shall be made, and
all violations of the approved plans and permits shall be abated. No new
building or portion of an existing building which is enlarged or altered
shall be used or occupied, in whole or in part, until such a certificate of
use and occupancy shall have been issued by the Code Enforcement
Officer.
J. Accounting. The Code Enforcement Officer shall keep an accurate
account of all fees collected; and such collected fees shall be deposited
in the Borough treasury or otherwise disposed of as required by law.

structure or to change the occupancy of a building or structure
requiring greater strength, exit or sanitary provisions or to install or
alter any plumbing, electrical or mechanical equipment or systems.
B. When permits are not required. Permits are not required for minor
repairs not involving structural work to floors, walls, ceilings and roofs;
plumbing repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or
valve, clearance or stoppages, or repairing or replacement of defective
faucets or valves; and for minor electrical repair work such as repairing
or replacing fuses, switches, receptacles, lamps or lighting fixture parts
and the connection of portable electrical appliances to previously
approved permanent receptacles.

such form as the Code Enforcement Officer may prescribe and shall be

officers, if the owner or lessee is a corporate body, shall be stated in the
application.
E. Description of work. The application shall contain a general description
of the proposed work, its location, the use and occupancy of all parts of
the building or structure and of all portions of the site or lot not covered
by the building or structure and such additional information as may be
required by the Code Enforcement Officer.
F. Plans and specifications. The application for the permit shall be
accompanied by not less than one copy of specifications and of plans
drawn to scale, with sufficient clarity and detail dimensions to show the
nature and character of the work to be performed. When quality of
materials is essential for conformity to the codes, specific information
shall be given to establish such quality; and the code shall not be cited,
nor the term "legal" or its equivalent be used, as a substitute for specific
information. The Code Enforcement Officer may waive the requirement
for filing plans when the work involved is of a minor nature. If in the
course of the work it is found necessary to make any change from the
approved plans and specifications on which a permit has been issued,
amended plans and specifications shall be submitted; and if approved, a
supplementary permit shall be issued to cover the change after the
same conditions required to secure the original permit have been
satisfied.

boundary line survey. Also, the site plan shall show the location of water
service and sewer connections with respect to any building in which a
plumbing system is to be installed. Vent stack terminations shall be
shown with respect to building ventilation openings which could allow
introduction of sewer gases into the building or any adjacent building.

adequate details of structural, mechanical, plumbing and electrical
work to be filed, including computations, stress diagrams and other
essential technical data. All engineering plans and computations shall
bear the signature of the engineer or architect responsible for the
design. Plans for buildings more than two stories in height shall
indicate where penetrations will be made for electrical, mechanical,
plumbing and communications conduits, pipes and systems and the
materials and methods for maintaining the required structural integrity,
fire-resistance rating and firestopping.
I. Other permits required. At the time of filing an application for a permit,
the applicant shall present to the Code Enforcement Officer evidence

the Sewage Enforcement Officer, the Fire Chief, the State Police Fire
Marshal, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry and the

either approve or reject said application. If said application is rejected,
the Code Enforcement Officer shall inform the applicant in writing,
stating the reasons for such rejection. If the Code Enforcement Officer
is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of the
applicable codes, the Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a permit
therefor as soon as practicable.

the work and shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel or set
aside any of the legally granted variation as described in the
application. All work shall conform to the approved application and
plans for which the permit has been issued and any approved
amendments thereto.

B. Signature to be attached to permit. The Code Enforcement Officer's
signature shall be attached to every permit; or the Code Enforcement
Officer may authorize a subordinate to affix such signature thereto.
C. Payment of fees. A permit to begin work shall not be issued until the
permit fees prescribed in this chapter have been paid, nor shall an
amendment to a permit necessitating an additional fee because of the
additional work involved be issued until the additional fee shall have
been paid.
D. Previous approvals. This chapter or the applicable codes shall not
require changes in the plans, the plumbing, electrical or mechanical
systems or the construction or designated use of a building for which a
lawful permit has been heretofore issued or otherwise lawfully
authorized and the construction of which has been actively prosecuted
within 90 days after the effective date of this chapter and is completed
with dispatch.
E. Approvals in part. The Code Enforcement Officer may issue permits for
the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or
structure before the entire plans and specifications for the whole
building or structure have been submitted, provided that adequate
information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all
the pertinent requirements of the codes. The holder of such permits
shall proceed at the holder's own risk with the building operation and
without assurance that permits for the entire structure will be granted.
F. Permit expiration dates.

requested, in writing, and such extensions may be granted by the
Code Enforcement Officer for good reason.

permit or approval issued under the provisions of the codes in case of
any false statement or misrepresentation of fact in the application or on
the plans on which the permit or approval was based.

be kept on the site of operations open to public inspection during the
entire time of prosecution of the work and until the completion of the
same.

A. Vacating structures. When in the opinion of the Code Enforcement
Officer an emergency exists on any premises or in any structure or part
thereof or on any defective equipment, which requires immediate
action to protect the public health, safety or welfare or that of the
occupants thereof, or if there is actual and immediate danger of failure
or collapse of a building or structure, the Code Enforcement Officer
may, with notice and service, issue an order reciting the existence of
such an emergency and requiring the vacating of the premises or such
action taken as the Code Enforcement Officer deems necessary to meet
such emergency. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, such
order shall be effective immediately, and the premises or equipment
involved shall be placarded immediately upon service of the order.

2:17
adequate exit facilities or which constitute a fire hazard or are
otherwise dangerous to human life or the public welfare or are found
to involve illegal or improper use, occupancy and maintenance shall
be condemned pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and may be
placarded and vacated. A vacant building or structure unguarded or
open at door or window shall be deemed a fire hazard and unsafe.
B. Unsafe structure. An unsafe structure is one in which all or part thereof
is found to be dangerous to life, health, property or the safety of the
public or its occupants because it is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated
or structurally unsafe or of such faulty construction or unstable
foundation that it is likely to partially or completely collapse, or which
contains unsafe equipment. All unsafe structures shall be taken down
and removed or made safe and secure as the Code Enforcement Officer
may deem necessary.
C. Unsafe equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device,
flammable liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or
within the structure which is in such disrepair or condition that it is
found to be a hazard to life, health, property or safety of the public or
occupants of the premises or structure. Unsafe equipment may
contribute to the finding that the structure is unsafe or unfit for human
occupancy or use.
D. Structure unfit for human habitation. A structure is unfit for human
occupancy or use whenever the Code Enforcement Officer finds that it
is unsafe, unlawful or, because of the degree in which it lacks
maintenance or is in disrepair, is unsanitary, vermin- or rat-infested,
contains filth and contamination or lacks ventilation, illumination,
sanitary or heating facilities or other essential equipment required by
this Code4 or because its location constitutes a hazard to its occupants
or to the public.

part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or
was erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.

the Code Enforcement Officer may be restored to a safe condition,
provided that change of use or occupancy is not contemplated nor
compelled by reason of such reconstruction or restoration, except that
if the damage or cost of reconstruction or restoration is in excess of
50% of its replacement value, exclusive of foundations, such structure
shall be made to comply with the Borough's Building, Plumbing and
Electrical Codes in all respects with the requirements for materials and
methods of construction or structures.5

§ 2-11. Vacating and placarding of condemned structures.
§ 2-12. Inspection of vacated structures; repair or demolition order.
G. Closing of vacant structures. If the structure or part thereof is vacant
and unfit for human habitation, human occupancy or use and is not in
danger of structural collapse, the code official may post a placard of
condemnation on the premises and may order the structure closed up
so it will not be an attractive nuisance. The exterior of the structure
must be maintained in compliance with the Borough's Property
Maintenance Code, Section PM-302.0, Exterior structure.6 The
windows and doors are to be boarded up with one-half-inch exterior
grade plywood, finished on one side with the finished side out. The
plywood shall be painted with two coats of exterior paint, the same
color as the exterior of the structure.
A. Vacating of structure. If the responsible owner, operator, occupant or
person in charge of the structure or premises fails to comply with an
order to repair or alter a structure condemned as unfit for human
habitation, the structure shall be vacated within a reasonable time, as
ordered by the Code Enforcement Officer.
B. Placarding of structure. Upon issuance of an order to vacate, the Code
Enforcement Officer may placard the structure or parts thereof or
defective equipment, said placard bearing the words "Unsafe for
Human Occupancy or Use" and a statement of the penalties provided
for any occupancy or use or for removing the placard.

penalties provided by this chapter.

structure into compliance with the Borough's codes and/or ordinances
or to demolish and remove the structure at the owner's option. Such
notice shall require the person thus notified to immediately disclose to
the Code Enforcement Officer his acceptance or rejection of the terms
of the order.
C. Unreasonable repairs. Whenever an inspection of a structure reveals
that the structure is so old, dilapidated or has become so out of repair
as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human
habitation, occupancy or use and so that it would be unreasonable to
repair, in that the cost of such repairs would exceed 100% of the
current value of such structure, the structure shall be declared a public
nuisance. The Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a notice to the
responsible owner, ordering that the structure be removed or
demolished without option on the part of the owner to repair. All the
rubbish and refuse shall be removed from the premises and the cellar/
basement shall be filled in with clean fill graded to adjacent ground
level.
D. Service connection. Before a structure can be demolished or removed,
the owner or agent shall notify all utilities having service connections
within the structure, such as water, electric, gas, sewer and other
connections. A permit to demolish or remove a structure shall not be
issued until a release is obtained from the utilities, stating that their
respective service connections and appurtenant equipment, such as
meters and regulators, have been removed or sealed and plugged in a
safe manner.
E. Notice to adjoining owners. Only when written notice has been given by
the applicant to the owners of adjoining lots and to the owners of wired
or other facilities, the temporary removal of which may be necessitated
by the proposed work, shall a permit be granted for the removal of a
building or structure.
F. Determination by Code Enforcement Officer. In the event that the
owner or agent is unable to obtain the releases specified in Subsection
D above, the Code Enforcement Officer shall inspect the premises for
which application has been made to determine that the utility service
connections and appurtenant equipment have been removed or sealed
and plugged in a safe manner.
A. Notice to owner. Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer determines
that work on any building or structure is being prosecuted contrary to
the provisions of the Borough's codes and/or ordinances in an unsafe
and dangerous manner, the responsible owner of the property involved
or the owner's agent or the person doing the work shall be notified that
such work shall be immediately stopped.
§ 2-12 § 2-13
2:20
§ 2-14. Violations and penalties.
B. Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work in or
about the structure after having been served with a stop-work order,
except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a
violation or unsafe conditions, shall be subject to the penalties provided
by this chapter.
A. Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to
erect, construct, alter, extend, repair, remove, demolish, use or occupy
any building or structure or plumbing, electrical and mechanical

cause same to be done, in conflict with or in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter and/or the Borough's codes.
B. Failure to comply. Whenever an order to vacate, repair and/or demolish
a structure which is a public nuisance because it is unsafe, dangerous
or unfit for human habitation has not been complied with, the Code
Enforcement Officer may, in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, proceed to cause the structure to be
vacated, repaired and/or demolished or take such other action as is
necessary to abate the nuisance. Abatement under this subsection shall
not commence until at least 10 days after the service of the order,
except that the Code Enforcement Officer may determine that more
immediate action is required because of the special emergency or
dangerous conditions which exist.
C. Recovery of expenses. The expenses incurred pursuant to Subsection B
of this section or § 2-9B and other applicable codes and ordinances shall
be paid by the responsible owner, operator or occupant or by the
persons who caused or maintained such a public nuisance. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall file on his records an affidavit stating with
fairness and accuracy the items and date of the expenses incurred. The
Council of the Borough of Steelton may institute a suit in assumpsit to
recover such expenses to be charged against the property as a lien.
D. Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any
provision of this chapter or who shall fail to correct a violation or
institute a remedial action as ordered by the Code Enforcement Officer
or who shall erect, construct, install, alter or repair a building or
structure or any plumbing, electrical and mechanical equipment or
systems in violation of an approved plan or directive of the Code
Enforcement Officer or of a permit or certificate issued under the
provisions of the Borough's codes shall, upon conviction in a summary
proceeding before any District Justice, be sentenced for each such
violation to pay a fine of not less than $10 plus costs and not more than
$300 plus costs and, in default thereof, to undergo imprisonment in the
county jail for a period not to exceed 30 days. Each day that a violation
continues after due notice has been served in accordance with the

B. Administration. To ensure that flood damage controls are being
employed in all new construction within the Flood-Fringe District, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall provide the applicant information
concerning the location of any Floodway or Flood-Fringe District
boundary relative to his proposed construction and the water surface
elevation of the one-hundred-year flood at the proposed construction
site.
(1) Plan requirements. The Code Enforcement Officer shall require the
following specific information to be included as part of an
application for a building permit:
(a) A plan which details the existing and proposed contours and
elevation of the ground and the lowest floor of proposed
construction, one-hundred-year elevations and other
associated factors such as pressures and impact forces, etc.,
storage elevations, size of the structure, location and
§ 44-5 § 44-5
44:70
elevations of streets, water supply, sanitary facilities, soil types
and floodproofing measures, including specific reference to the
level of the floodproofing in relation to the one-hundred-year
flood.
(b) A document, certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, which states that the proposed construction has
been adequately designed to withstand the flood depths,
pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the one-hundred-year flood. Such statement
shall include a description of the type and extent of
floodproofing measures which have been incorporated into the
design of the structure.
(2) Review by the County Conservation District. A copy of all plans for
proposed development shall be submitted by the Code
Enforcement Officer to the County Conservation District for review
and comment prior to the issuance of a permit. The
recommendations of the County Conservation District may be
incorporated into the plan to provide for protection against
predictable hazards.
(3) Variances.
(a) If compliance with the elevation or floodproofing requirements
stated above would result in an exceptional hardship for a
prospective builder, developer or landowner, the Borough may,
upon request, grant relief from the strict application of the
requirement.
(b) Requests for variances to the strict application of the
provisions of this section may be granted by the Borough in
accordance with the following procedures and criteria:
[1] No variances shall be granted for any construction,
development, use or activity within any floodway area that
would cause any increase in the one-hundred-year
elevation.
[2] If granted, a variance shall involve only the least
modification necessary to provide relief.
[3] In granting any variance, the Borough may attach
whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it
considers necessary in order to protect the public health,
safety and welfare and to achieve the objectives of this
chapter.
[4] Whenever a variance is granted, the Borough shall notify
the applicant, in writing, that:
§ 44-5 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION § 44-5
44:71
[a] The granting of the variance may result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance.
[b] Such variances may increase the risks to life and
property.
[5] In reviewing any request for a variance, the Borough shall
consider but shall not be limited to the following:
[a] That there is good and sufficient cause.
[b] That failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
[c] That the granting of the variance will not result in any
unacceptable or prohibited increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with any other
applicable local or state ordinances and regulation.
[6] A complete record of all variance requests and related
actions shall be maintained by the Borough. In addition, a
report of all variances granted during the year shall be
included in the annual report to the Federal Insurance
Administration.
(c) Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall
be designed and constructed so as to have the capability of
resisting the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
pressures and effects of buoyancy of the one-hundred-year
flood.
(d) Other permit issuance requirements. Prior to the issuance of
any building permit, the Borough Code Enforcement Officer
shall review the application for permit to determine if all other
necessary governmental permits such as those required by
state and federal laws have been obtained, including those
required by Act 537, the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act;14

§ 49-30. Findings; purpose.
The people and citizens of the Borough of Steelton, acting by and through
their duly elected governing body, this Borough Council, are aware that
the practice of body massage under certain circumstances can scientifically
promote physical well-being by relieving and relaxing muscle tension,
stimulating vascular circulation which enhances the disposition of waste
products generated by muscular exercise and assisting in the development
of muscle tone through a form of passive exercise. It is further recognized
that the physical contact involved in such practice can provide a source of
communication of disease for which the health and safety of the community
requires local government control and supervision. This Council further
recognizes that various businesses operating under the guise of practicing
body massage, sometimes called "massage parlors," are intended to
stimulate sexual and erotic reactions which this Council believes is contrary
to the morals and welfare of this Borough. In addition to regulating the
legitimate and bona fide practice of massage, this Borough Council intends
to prohibit and prevent the abuse of said practice for sexual and erotic
stimulation purposes.

ARTICLE IV
Sexually Oriented Business Operations
[Adopted 6-19-1995 by Ord. No. 95-7; approved 6-19-1995]
§ 49-49. Findings.
The Borough Council of the Borough of Steelton finds that sexually oriented
businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including
prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature. The concern over
sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the Borough
of Steelton which demands reasonable regulation of sexually oriented
businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of the citizens.
Permitting and/or licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of
accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses
comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not
knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual
activity or solicitation. There is convincing documented evidence that
sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a
deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the
surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime
and the downgrading of property values. It is recognized that sexually
oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable
operational characteristics, particularly when they are located in close
proximity to each other, thereby contributing to neighborhood blight and
downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area. The Borough of
Steelton desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby
protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens
from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property
values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread
of neighborhood blight. It is not the intent of this article to suppress
any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a
content-neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses. It is not the intent of the Borough Council to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
§ 49-50. Intent.
It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses
to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the
Borough, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent
the continued deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented
businesses within the Borough. The provisions of this article have neither
the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content
of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.

(1) The Borough Council finds that a curfew is a very real local need,
necessary as a significant factor and tool to minimize juvenile
delinquency in light of the Borough of Steelton's local situation and
facts, including the following: The Borough is located in the
southwest portion of Dauphin County and is bounded by the
Susquehanna River and the adjacent municipalities of Lower
Swatara Township, Swatara Township and the Borough of
Highspire. While containing residential, commercial and industrial
areas, the Borough is essentially a residential community
containing distinct areas of concentrated residential development.
There is a general community sense of the need of cessation, at the
proper time, of outdoor activities of minors on the streets, this
sense being reflected in the curfew hours declared by this Chapter
51 which takes into consideration also the danger hours for
nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential
risks incident to immaturity.
(2) The Borough Council finds that the Borough of Steelton is not
overcrowded. The population density, as reflected through a
§ 49-65 CURFEW § 51-2
51:115
§ 51-3. Definitions; word usage.
compilation derived from the Borough of Steelton Comprehensive
Plan, is 5.33 persons per acre. The total area is 1,216.22 acres.
Of this, 180.23 acres are devoted to residential land use, 21.12
acres are devoted to commercial use, 705.82 acres are devoted
to industrial use and 309.05 acres are devoted to other use.
Population density is concentrated principally on the eastern side
of the Borough from the northern Borough line to the southern
Borough line. Recreational areas are provided in most of the
densely compact residential areas; however, these facilities are
generally closed for usage at times when the activities which this
Chapter 51 attempts to prevent occur by minors who are running
the streets.
(3) The Borough Council finds that there are 1,084 minors residing in
the Borough of Steelton. The Borough of Steelton has two
elementary schools serving 873 minors. There is also a juniorsenior
high school directly adjacent to the eastern Borough line
serving 580 minors from the Borough itself.
(4) The Borough Council further finds that the Borough of Steelton
population (1980 federal census and 1986 school census
compilation) is 6,484. There are approximately 2,250 households in
the Borough. The residential areas of the Borough are principally
stable family communities. Parental responsibility for the
whereabouts of children is the norm. As parental control increases,
the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases and there is a need
for the nocturnal curfew for the minors which will achieve, under
local conditions, the purposes hereinbefore stated.
A. For the purposes of the Curfew Chapter, the following terms, phrases,
words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein:
BOROUGH  The Borough of Steelton, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania,
with administrative offices at 123 North Front Street, Steelton,
Pennsylvania, 17113.
MINOR  Any person under the age of 18 or, in the equivalent phrasing
often herein employed, any person 17 or fewer years of age.
PARENT  Any person having legal custody of a minor:
REMAIN  To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the
streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors)
(1) As a natural or adoptive parent;
(2) As a legal guardian;
(3) As a person who stands in loco parentis; or
As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of
court.
(4)
§ 51-2 § 51-3
51:116
§ 51-4. Curfew established.
It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or fewer years of age (under 18) to
be or remain in or upon the streets within the Borough of Steelton at night
during the period ending 6:00 a.m. and beginning:
totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be
using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage
or going home. To implement that thought with additional precision
and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in § 51-5 so
that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence-type curfew ordinance.
More and more exceptions become available with increasing years
and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable
regulation which is intended by use of the meaningful phrase "be
or remain" found constitutional in Baker v. Borough of Steelton, 17
Dauph. 17 (1912), a decision properly classified in Thistlewood v, Trial
Magistrate for Ocean City, 204 A.2d 688, 691 (MD 1964) as relating to
a curfew ordinance of the remaining type.
STREET  A way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of
the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or, in
case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. The term "street"
includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway
of traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and
any grassplots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of
a street. The term "street" applies irrespective of what it is called or
formally named, whether "alley," "avenue," "court," "road" or otherwise.
TIME OF NIGHT  Referred to herein is based upon the prevailing
standard of time, whether Eastern standard time or Eastern daylight
saving time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the
Borough, prima facie the time then observed in the Borough
administrative offices and police station.
YEAR OF AGE  Continues from one birthday, such as the 17th, to
(but not including the day of) the next, such as the 18th birthday,
making it clear that 17 or fewer years of age is herein treated as
equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of age," the latter phrase in
practice, unfortunately, having confused a number of persons into the
mistaken thought that eighteen-year-olds might be involved. Similarly,
for example, 15 or fewer years of age means "under 16 years of age."
B. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense
include the future, words in the plural number include the singular and
words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is
always mandatory and not merely directory.
A. At 10:00 p.m. for minors up to and including age 15.
B. At 11:00 p.m. for minors 16 or more years of age.
§ 51-3 CURFEW § 51-5
51:117
§ 51-5. Exceptions.
In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a Borough street during the
nocturnal hours for which § 51-4 is intended to provide the maximum limits
of regulation (and a clear general guide for minors, their parents and their
fellow citizens) shall not, however, be considered in violation of the Curfew
Ordinance:
A. When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
B. When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated
period of time and purpose within a specified area.
C. When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona
fides of such exercise by first delivering to communications center
personnel at the Borough Municipal Building at 123 North Front Street,
where and by whom high-priority messages to the Chief of Police are
regularly received, a written communication, signed by such minor and
countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of such minor with their home
address and telephone number, addressed to the Chief of Police of the
Borough, specifying when, where and in what manner said minor will
be on the streets at night (during hours when the Curfew Ordinance is
otherwise applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a First
Amendment right specified in such communication.
D. In case of reasonable necessity but only after such minor's parent has
communicated to the Borough police station personnel the facts
establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a
designated time for a described purpose, including points of origin and
destination. A copy of such communication or of the police record
thereof duly certified by the Chief of Police to be correct, with an
appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and
address of such parent and minor, shall be admissible evidence.
E. When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not
communicating an objection to the police officer.
F. When returning home by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes of
the termination of) a school activity or an activity of a religious or other
voluntary association of which prior notice, indicating the place and
probable time of termination, has been given, in writing, to and duly
filed for immediate reference by the Chief of Police or the officer
assigned by him on duty at the police station, thus encouraging (here as
in other exceptional situations) conduct on the part of minors involved
in such activities and striking a fair balance for any somewhat
conflicting interests.
§ 51-5 § 51-5
51:118
G. When authorized by special permit from the Chief of Police carried on
the person of the minor thus authorized, as follows: When necessary
nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by
other provisions of this Chapter 51, then recourse may be had to the
Chief of Police of the Borough, either for a regulation as provided in
Subsection H or for a special permit, as the circumstances warrant.
Upon the Chief of Police's finding of necessity for the use of the streets
to the extent warranted by a written application (as judicially approved
in People v. Walton, 161 P.2d 498, 502-503, Cal App. 1945), signed by a
minor and by a parent of such minor, if feasible, stating: the name, age
and address of such minor; the name, address and telephone number of
a parent thereof; the height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and
other physical characteristics of such minor; the necessity which
requires such minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours
otherwise applicable; and the street or route and the beginning and
ending of the period of time involved by date and hour, the Chief of
Police may grant a permit, in writing, for the use by such minor of such
streets at such hours as, in the Chief's opinion, may reasonably be
necessary. In an emergency, this may be handled by telephone or other
effective communication, with a corresponding record being made
contemporaneously, either to the Chief of Police or, if unavailable, to the
police officer authorized by the Chief of Police to act on his behalf in an
emergency, at the police station.
H. When authorized by regulation issued by the Chief of Police in other
similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to
necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt
with on an individual special permit basis. Normally, such regulation by
the Chief of Police permitting use of the streets should be issued
sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news
media and through other agencies, such as the schools, and shall define
the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of
time involved, not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for
termination of such activity, and the reason for finding that such
regulation is reasonably necessary to implement the purposes of this
Curfew Chapter.
I. When the minor carries a certified card of employment, renewable each
calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued
not more than 45 days previously, signed by the Chief of Police and
briefly identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and of his place
of employment and his hours of employment.
J. When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly
exempts bona fide interstate movement through the Borough of
Steelton. This also exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in the
Borough of Steelton.
K. When the minor is 17 years of age, if and when the Chief of Police shall
have determined, by formal rule first reported to and approved by the
§ 51-5 CURFEW § 51-5
51:119
§ 51-6. Parental responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly
to permit or by inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain upon
any Borough street under circumstances not constituting an exception to or
otherwise beyond the scope of the Curfew Ordinance. The term "knowingly"
includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have
concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody.
It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to
a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an
objective test. It shall, afortiori, be no defense that a parent was completely
indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
§ 51-7. Police procedures.
A policeman of the Borough, upon finding or having attention called to
any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the Curfew Ordinance,
normally shall take the minor to the Borough police station, where a parent
shall immediately be notified to come for such minor, whereupon they
shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under
constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts and to centralize responsibility
in the officer there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial
and uniform enforcement and recording, thus making available experienced
supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access to information and
records. In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth certificate,
a policeman on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in
determining age.
Borough Council, spread upon its minutes and so reported in the press,
finding the facts as to the extent (minimal) of juvenile delinquency in
such age group permitting such rule, currently, in the best interests
of said minor and of the Borough, finding that the Curfew Ordinance
should be relaxed, then the Chief of Police, by such formal rule,
covering a period of time designated therein or until rescission thereof
not exceeding one year from the date thereof, may take appropriate
action excepting designated minors, minors in a defined group or area
or all minors (as the current facts may warrant) 17 years of age at the
date or attaining 17 years of age during the period that such formal rule
is and remains in effect.
L. Each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations, such as
provisions for notification, are severable as hereinafter provided but
here reemphasized; and additional, also severable, exceptions,
broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled
respectively in elementary, junior high and high schools, will be
considered by the Borough Council as warranted by future experience
illuminated by the views of student government associations, school
personnel, citizens, associations, ward, precinct and neighborhood
spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in authority concerned
positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
§ 51-5 § 51-7
51:120
§ 51-8. Violations and penalties.
Prevailing community standards and the real internalization thereof or
interpersonal sanctions therefor that in practice count for much as to when
minors should be off the streets, reflected in this Curfew Ordinance, are
hereby undergirded with the following legal sanctions:
A. Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience
and may provide, inter alia, that the policeman may deliver to a parent
thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example, a minor
of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be
ascertained or are known.
B. In any event, such policeman shall, within 24 hours, file a written report
with the Chief of Police or shall participate to the extent of the
information for which he is responsible in the preparation by himself
and the officer involved in such case and in the filing of such report
within 24 hours.
C. When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of a minor
and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located
or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to
the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that, in accordance with
police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the
minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other
person who will, on behalf of a parent, assume the responsibility of
caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent.
D. In the case of a first violation by a minor, if the parent comes for the
child, said parent shall be given a written notice of said violation with a
warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the Curfew Ordinance, including enforcement of parental responsibility
and of applicable penalties, and said parent shall, upon receipt of said
notice, sign a written receipt therefor; if the parent does not come for
the child, the Chief of Police shall, by certified mail, send the aforesaid
written notice to the parent.
A. If, after the warning notice pursuant to § 51-7 of a first violation by a
minor, a parent violates § 51-6 (in connection with a second violation by
said minor), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For
such first parental offense, a parent shall be fined $25 and, for each
subsequent offense by a parent, the fine shall be increased by an
additional $25, e.g., $50 for the second, $75 for the third offense. The
District Justice, upon finding a parent guilty, shall sentence the parent
to pay such fine and the costs of prosecution and, upon refusal to pay
such fine and costs, to be imprisoned in the jail of Dauphin County for a
period not exceeding 30 days. Every day that a violation of this chapter
continues shall constitute a separate offense.
§ 51-7 CURFEW § 51-8
51:121
§ 51-9. Construal of provisions.
Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of the Curfew
Ordinance. If any provision, including, inter alia, any exception, part, phrase
or term or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held
invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby and the validity of the Curfew Ordinance in any and
all other respects shall not be affected thereby. From excess of caution,
the Chief of Police is authorized to give advisory opinions, in writing or
immediately reduced to writing, which shall be binding and shall be
adhered to by the police, until the chapter is amended in such respect,
interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally, such
advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed letters
addressed to him at the Borough administration building, questioning as
ambiguous, as having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights
specifically invoked or as otherwise invalid, in all three categories with
respect to proposed conduct definitely described. This administrative
remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in
any of said three categories. The Borough Council does not intend a result
that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable. It is intended that
the Curfew Ordinance be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where
its application would be unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is
intended and shall be given. The Borough Council does not intend to violate
the constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the Constitution
of the United States of America.
§ 51-10. Continuing evaluation.
The Borough Council will continue its evaluation and updating of the
Curfew Ordinance.
B. Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of the Curfew
Ordinance more than three times shall be reported by the Chief of
Police to a society or organization whose purpose it is to take charge of
incorrigibles and delinquents, and proceedings shall then be taken,
under the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301 et seq., before the Juvenile
Court for the treatment, supervision and rehabilitation of such minor.
C. A like procedure, before the juvenile authorities, shall be followed in
any case where the imposing of a fine or fines upon a parent shall not be
effective or where for any other reason the provisions of the Curfew
Ordinance cannot be made effective by the imposing of penalties under
this § 51-8.
A. Accordingly, there shall be compiled and informally reported to the
Borough Council through effective channels (such as the normal
monthly distribution by the Borough Secretary to each Councilman, the
Chief of Police and the Borough Solicitor of noteworthy material) all
exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the notices of
school and other activities, the Chief of Police's special permits and the

§ 76-5. Standards for permit issuance.
The Borough Secretary shall issue a permit as provided for hereunder
when, from a consideration of the application and from such other
information as may otherwise be obtained, he finds that:
(1) Each application shall be accompanied by an initial fee, payable to
the Borough, in the amount of $756.52.
(a) $25 for an application processing fee.

cleanup after the parade at the rate of $18 per hour for four
hours.
(c) $443.52 for the provision of four Borough police officers to
provide police services for a standard parade at the rate of
$27.72 per hour for four hours.
(2) If the length of the parade is such that additional officers or
cleanup personnel are required, the fee will increase according to
the hourly rate indicated above. The applicant will be billed for an
additional expense. In the event that the time required for the
activities of cleanup by Borough personnel or involvement of police
officers is less than the hours set forth above, the Borough will
recompute the cost and refund to the applicant the amount by
which the minimum payment required above exceeds the actual
expense and remit it to the applicant within 30 days of the
conclusion of the parade.
E. Insurance. Each person filing an application for a parade permit shall
provide the Borough with a certificate of insurance evidencing that said
person maintains insurance which will protect that person and the
Borough of Steelton from claims for damages for personal injury,
including accidental death, as well as claims for property damages
which may arise from the conduct of the parade. The amounts of such
insurance shall be as follows:
(1) Public liability insurance in an amount of not less than $1,000,000
for injuries, including accidental death, to any one person and
property damage insurance in an amount of not less than

Steelton as an additional insured and shall be provided by an
insurance company authorized to do business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and acceptable to the Borough.
A. The conduct of the parade will not so substantially interrupt the safe
and orderly movement of traffic within the Borough of Steelton on and
contiguous to the proposed route so as to create a real and present
danger to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Borough
of Steelton.
§ 76-4 § 76-5
76:158
§ 76-6. Time limit for decision; notice of disapproval.

the application, the Borough Secretary shall send, by certified mail, within
15 days after the day upon which the application was filed, a notice of his
action stating with specificity the reasons for his denial of the permit. Said
notice shall also advise the applicant of his or her right to file an appeal
and shall also advise him or her of the procedure for filing an appeal by
providing him or her with a copy of § 76-7, Appeals.

date on which the applicant received notice of the denial of the application
for a parade permit. The Borough Council must render a decision on said
appeal, in writing, within 10 days of receipt of the appeal.
B. The conduct of the parade will not create a real and present danger to
the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Borough of Steelton
by preventing fire-fighting equipment, ambulances, rescue vehicles
and/or police vehicles from being able to reach any property in the
Borough of Steelton.
C. The conduct of such parade will not require the diversion of so great a
number of ambulances as to prevent normal ambulance service to
portions of the Borough other than that to be occupied by the proposed
line of march and areas contiguous thereto.
D. The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at assembly points
of the parade will not unduly interfere with proper fire and police
protection of or ambulance services to areas contiguous to such
assembly areas.
E. The conduct of such parade will not interfere with the movement of firefighting
equipment en route to a fire.

§ 76-5 above, shall find that the application for issuance of a permit for
a parade on the date, at the time and over the route requested by the
application must be denied, he may, in addition to advising the applicant of
the denial of the application, also issue an alternate permit which authorizes
the conduct of the parade on a date, at a time or over a route different
from that named by the application. The alternate permit shall be sent to
the applicant by certified mail, together with the letter required by § 76-5
above. Whenever the Borough Secretary shall issue an alternate permit, the
letter sent to the applicant, in addition to conforming to the requirements
of § 76-5 above, shall also advise the applicant that, if the applicant wishes
to accept the alternate permit, the applicant must mail or deliver a letter
to the Borough Secretary of the Borough of Steelton at 123 North Front
Street, Steelton, Pennsylvania 17113, in which the applicant accepts the
alternate permit and, further, advising the applicant that this letter must be
received within 10 days after receipt by the applicant of the letter sent to
the applicant pursuant to § 76-5 above. The applicant shall also be advised
that, unless the applicant accepts the alternate permit within 10 days, the
alternate permit will be void and of no effect. Finally, the applicant shall
also be advised that the applicant may either accept the alternate permit
or pursue an appeal of the denial of a parade permit for the date, time
and route requested by the applicant by following the procedure set forth
in § 76-7 above. An alternate parade permit issued pursuant to this section

for final inspection. Within 30 working days after said notice, the
Borough, or the Borough's agent, may begin to inspect the collection
system with a mobile television unit rented or otherwise obtained by the
Borough, to verify that the system has been completed in accordance
with the Borough's Standard Construction Specifications.
J. Promptly upon completion of the extension, but no longer than 60 days
after the completion, the applicant shall submit to the Borough, at his
own expense, a set of drawings of the completed extension project as
detailed in the Standard Construction Specifications. Where applicable,
and within the aforesaid 60 days after the completion of the project, the
applicant shall also cause to be prepared, executed, acknowledged and
delivered to the Borough a deed of dedication for the entire extension
project, and all of its appurtenances as well as all rights-of-way over the
street and other thoroughfares and private lanes necessary for the
existence and future maintenance thereof.
K. In the event of dedication as set forth in the above paragraph, the
applicant shall, for a period of two years after delivery of said deed of

For each connection made to the sewer system, the following fees and
charges will be imposed:
A. Capacity fee and charge.
(1) For all connections made to the sewer system (including the
existing system, additions to the system and capped sewers
whether built by the Borough or built by or at the expense of
developers), a capacity fee and charge shall be imposed to reflect
the value of service readily available for use and to reflect the
capital costs associated with the Borough's wastewater facilities.
(2) This fee shall also be imposed whenever: 1) a new building or
facility is connected to an existing building sewer or the internal
drainage system of an existing building or facility; 2) an existing
building or facility is expanded in such a way that the generated
quantity of wastewater is likely to exceed one EDU. Flow estimates
shall be made by the Borough based on sound engineering practice.
(3) Said capacity fee and charge shall be as shown on the Rate
Schedule as "Tapping Fee  Capacity Part," and shall be due and
payable at the time the application for connection is filed. Said fee
and charge shall be in addition to any and all other fees and
charges pursuant to this article.
(4) If two or more residential units, stores, offices, industrial units,
etc., are connected to the sewer system through a single building
sewer, or if two or more types of uses are made of the same
improved property, the tapping fee shall be computed as though
each residential unit, store, office, industrial unit, etc., were a
separate improved property or user with a separate connection to
the sewer. In other words, multiple uses of the same building are
additive.
B. For all new connections to the sewer system, a collection system fee
and charge will be imposed to recover the cost to the Borough of
constructing street mains. Said fee and charge shall be as shown on the
Rate Schedule as "Tapping Fee  Collection Part" and shall be due and
payable at the time the application for connection is filed. Said fee and
charge shall be in addition to any and all other fees and charges
imposed pursuant to this article.

application for connection is filed. Said fee and charge shall be in
addition to any and all other fees and charges imposed pursuant to this
article.
A. Inspection fee and charge.
(1) An inspection fee and charge shall be imposed for the inspection of
any building sewer or pressure sewer system installation and shall
be shown on the Rate Schedule as "Inspection Fee." Said fee and
charge shall be established based on the following costs to the
Borough:
(a) The actual costs to the Borough of inspecting said installation.
(b) For the installation of a building sewer or pressure sewer
system which is under a sewer extension agreement with the
Borough, the actual costs to the Borough of inspecting the
installation.
(2) Said fee and charge shall be in addition to any and all other fees
and charges imposed pursuant to this article. Said inspection fee
shall be as shown on the Rate Schedule as "Customer Facility
Fee  Inspection Fee."
A. By specific resolution of the Borough, a reservation of capacity fee may
be imposed upon all properties which may be lawfully required to
connect to the sewer system of the Borough, but which have not been
connected thereto, provided that such reservation of capacity fee shall
be effective upon the expiration of at least 60 days after the notice to
connect to the sewer system has been received. This fee may also be
imposed upon the owners of property who have requested the Borough
to reserve capacity for future development, either directly or by
submitting a planning module for the Borough's approval.
B. The reservation of capacity fee shall be in an amount established from
time to time by the Borough and shall be billed and collected at the
same time and in the same manner as the sewer rentals or charges
imposed by the Borough for the users of the sewer system.
C. Reservation of capacity and payment of the reservation of capacity fee
shall be limited to one year. Connection to the sewer system must be
completed within 60 days of the end of that year. If requested, a onetime,
six-month extension may be granted by the Borough. If the

§ 90-98. Sewer rentals or charges.
A. Sewer rentals or charges are imposed upon, and shall be collected
from, the owner of each improved property which shall be connected
with the sewer system. The charge is for the availability of use of the
sewer system, whether such use shall be direct or indirect, and shall be
payable as provided herein.
B. Sewer rentals shall be based upon the Rate Schedule adopted by the
Borough and amended from time to time.
(1) All Sewer rentals shall be computed in accordance with the rates
shown on the current Rate Schedule.
(2) Sewer rental billings under this section shall be rendered in arrears
of the service provided.
(3) Owners of property connected to the sewer system for only a
portion of a period shall pay a pro rata sewer rental for the period
of time actually connected during the first period.
(4) The sewer rental or charge for all nonresidential establishments
shall be based on the reading obtained from the water service
meter.
(5) The sewer rental or charge for any nonresidential establishment
that does not install a water service meter will be based on the EDU
rating listed in the Rate Schedule.
(6) Exclusion from the sewerage system of noncontaminated
wastewaters and waters used solely for cooling purposes may be
required by the Borough, or such exclusion may be optional with
the property owner if not required by the Borough. When such
wastewaters are excluded, sewer rentals shall be based upon total
water consumed, less water excluded, at the rates stipulated under
Subsection A above. Water excluded from the sewerage system
may be determined from meters installed and maintained by the
property owner or the Borough or from estimates or measurements
made by the Borough. The Borough may require any individual
establishment or the industrial establishment may elect to install,
pay for and maintain a meter approved by the Borough for
measuring the volume of sewage and waste actually discharged to
the sewerage system, in which case sewer rentals shall be
computed as set forth under Subsection A above. For sewer rental
purposes, any business concern having 20 or more persons on the
payroll per working day during the quarter immediately preceding
the quarter for which the sewer billing is rendered shall be
classified as an industrial establishment.
(7) Additional classifications, sewer rentals or modifications of the
above sewer rental schedule may be established by the Borough
from time to time as deemed necessary.

shown on the Rate Schedule.
§ 90-100. Estimated charges.
Whenever any person discharges or permits to be discharged any material
into the sewer system by any means other than through a connection
approved in accordance with these regulations, the Borough reserves the
right to estimate the quantity and strength of the material and to make an
appropriate charge based on such estimate.
§ 90-101. Billing and collection procedures.
(8) Notwithstanding the provisions above, sewer rents and charges
shall be levied upon all users of the sewer system to reflect
applicable United States Environmental Agency rules and
regulations promulgated in connection with user charges and
industrial cost recovery charges.
A. The net amount of the sewer rental billing furnished to owners shall, in
general, be rendered on a quarterly basis on or about the first day of
February, May, August and November.
B. All bills for sewer service sent to owners are payable immediately upon
receipt of the bill. If not paid by February 28, May 31, August 31 and

collected as part thereof, and if not paid by March 31, June 30,
September 30 and December 31, an additional 5% penalty of the
current bill will be added and collected as part thereof. Thereafter, if

provision, the following guidelines are hereby established:
A. Haulers shall be required to file with the Borough a complete schedule
of rates showing evidence that their rates are established on a volume
basis, and said rates shall be annually for the length of the contract.
B. An exclusive contract for the collection of residential municipal waste
that may be established by the Borough shall include provisions for
billing residential units on a volume basis by the exclusive collector.
These provisions shall not preclude the Borough or its collector from
establishing a minimum charge for solid waste collection as an
assessment against the property for the benefit to the health and
welfare of the community for having a comprehensive solid waste
collection program available to the owners of property in the Borough.
Such minimum charges will be set at a level that is approximate to
cover the basic cost of solid waste collection but shall not be set so high
as to discourage recycling of solid waste.
§ 92-17 SOLID WASTE § 92-19
92:275
§ 92-19. Changes to be set by resolution.
All quarterly fees established under an exclusive contract for the collection
of waste by the exclusive contractor shall be established by a resolution
of the Council of Steelton Borough. Any surcharge(s) so established shall
be reviewed at least annually and adjusted as necessary to ensure that all
costs involved in the collection and disposal of municipal waste under the
exclusive contract, including the administrative costs of the Borough are
covered by the surcharge(s).

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 93-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "Stormwater
Management."
§ 93-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the Borough finds that:
A. Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater
and increased runoff flows and velocities, which overtax the carrying
capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, and greatly increases
the cost to the public to manage stormwater.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
C. A program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation
of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural
infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the
protection of the people of the Borough and all the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain boroughs to implement a
program of stormwater controls. These boroughs are required to obtain
a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES).
G. Nonstormwater discharges to Borough separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
Borough.
§ 93-1 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 93-3
93:279
§ 93-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Borough and its watersheds, by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 93-2 of this chapter, through provisions designed
to:
§ 93-4. Statutory authority.
The Borough of Steelton is empowered to regulate land use activities that
affect stormwater impacts by the authority of the following statutory
provisions: the Borough Code, 53 P.S. § 46202(17), 53 P.S. § 47201; the
Storm Water Management Act, 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
§ 93-5. Applicability.
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
B. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
C. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
D. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
E. Focus on infiltration of stormwater, to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
F. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
G. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
"existing uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support those
uses in all streams.
H. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
I. Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management BMPs that are implemented in the Borough.
J. Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES
permit requirements.
K. Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to
address nonstormwater discharges into the Borough separate storm
sewer system.
A. This chapter applies to any regulated earth disturbance activities
within the Borough, and all stormwater runoff entering into the
§ 93-3 § 93-5
93:280
§ 93-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the Borough inconsistent
with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only.
§ 93-7. Severability.
In the event that any section or provision of this chapter is declared invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the
validity of any of the remaining sections or provisions of this chapter.
§ 93-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
Borough separate storm sewer system from lands within the boundaries
of the Borough.
B. Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management
controls are also regulated under existing state law and implementing
regulations. This chapter shall operate in coordination with those
parallel requirements; the requirements of this chapter shall be no less
restrictive in meeting the purposes of this chapter than state law.
A. Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve
the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or
ordinance. To the extent that this chapter imposes more rigorous or
stringent requirements for stormwater management, the specific
requirements contained in this chapter shall be followed.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any of the Borough's
requirements regarding stormwater matters which do not conflict with
the provisions of this chapter such as local stormwater management
design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection system design
and details, outlet structure design, etc.). Conflicting provisions in
other Borough ordinances or regulations shall be construed to retain
the requirements of this chapter addressing state water quality
requirements.

Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained under state
regulations.
A.
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to protect
the streambank, streambed and structural integrity of the waterway, to
prevent these impacts.

or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
105.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities.
B. In the event that any person shall intend to make changes in the
contour of any land or engage in earthmoving activity, whether for
subdivision, land development or any purpose, such person, who is
required to obtain a permit, shall obtain such a permit from the DEP in
accordance with the requirements of the "Rules and Regulations,"
Chapter 102, Erosion Control, authorized under P.L. 1987, June 22,
1937. DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control
plan for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more,
under 25 Pa. Code Section 102.4(b).
C. Furthermore, under the requirements noted above, the Borough of
Steelton shall notify the DEP immediately upon receipt of an application
for a building permit involving earthmoving activity which affects five
acres or more of land. The Borough shall not issue a building permit to
those engaged in earthmoving activities requiring a DEP permit until
the DEP has issued the permit.
D. DEP has regulations, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, that a DEP
"NPDES construction activities" permit is required for regulated earth
disturbance activities.
E. Evidence of any necessary permits for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the Southcentral Regional DEP office or Dauphin County
Conservation District must be provided to the Borough.
F. An erosion and sedimentation control plan must be prepared for a
single lot or more where subdivision, land development or other
earthmoving activity is proposed. The plan must be submitted:

93:288
§ 93-14. Water quality requirements after regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete.
G. Such erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be submitted to the
Borough Engineer and Dauphin County Conservation District for
review, and a copy of the plan and review comments shall be submitted
to the Steelton Borough Planning Commission as part of the preliminary
and final plat applications.
H. In the preparation of erosion and sedimentation control plans the
person preparing such plans shall consult with the Dauphin County
Conservation District to determine the measures needed to control
erosion and sedimentation. The current DEP Erosion and
Sedimentation Pollution Control Program Manual shall be used in the
preparation of such plans. Copies are available in the Dauphin County
Conservation District office.

stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that
postconstruction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(#392-0300-002. September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions.
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater
runoff and
(3) Streambank and streambed protection: management of volume and
rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent physical
degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).

§ 93-13 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 93-14
93:289
§ 93-15. General standards.
D. DEP has regulations that require boroughs to ensure design,
implementation, and maintenance of best management practices
(BMPs) that control runoff from new development and redevelopment
after regulated earth disturbance activities are complete. These
requirements include the need to implement postconstruction
stormwater BMPs with assurance of long-term operations and
maintenance of those BMPs. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for
regulated earth disturbance activities from the Southcentral DEP
Regional Office must be provided to the Borough.
E. BMP operations and maintenance requirements are described in Article
IV of this chapter.
A. A stormwater management plan shall be prepared and stormwater
drainage facilities required, as necessary, to:
(1) Permit the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses;
(2) Ensure the drainage of all low points along the line of streets and
other applicable areas;
(3) Intercept, retain, or detain surface water runoff in a manner
reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area drained;
(4) Provide positive drainage away from buildings.
B. The stormwater management plan shall contain and illustrate the
following:
(1) The mapping of the watershed area or areas in which the proposed
subdivision or land development is located.
(2) Calculations of runoff based on either the Soils Cover Complex
Method or Rational Method, as approved by the Borough Council.
(3) The complete drainage system for the subdivision or land
development including the identification of drainage features
which will be incorporated into the design.
(4) An overall stormwater management plan for the entire site. If the
subdivision or land development is to be developed in phases, the
plan shall be submitted with the first phase and appropriate future
development phases for the drainage system shall be indicated.
The advice of the Borough Engineer shall be sought in designing
the stormwater management plan.
C. The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the
affected landowners.
§ 93-14 § 93-15
93:290
D. Stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall not be diverted so as
to overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public
lands, without approved provisions being made by the applicant for
properly handling such conditions.
E. Facilities for storm drainage shall be designed to handle the anticipated
peak discharge from the property being subdivided as well as to handle
the anticipated increase in runoff that will occur when all the property
at a higher elevation in the same watershed area is fully developed.
F. Where a watercourse runs across or through a subdivision, a drainage
easement, which conforms with the line of such watercourse, shall be
provided at such a width as will be adequate to preserve the unimpeded
flow of natural drainage.
G. All drainage structures that are located within the right-of-way of state
highways shall be approved by PennDOT and a letter of approval
PennDOT office shall be directed to the Steelton Borough Planning
Commission.
H. All streets shall be designed so that surface water is discharged from
their right-of-way. The slope of the crown on proposed streets shall not
be less than 1/8 of an inch per foot and not grater than 1/3 of an inch
per foot.
I. Storm drainage facilities, as required, shall be placed in front of the
curb or curb line when located in a street right-of-way. When located in
undedicated land, they shall be placed within an easement, as approved
by the Borough Council, who may require additional width of easement
as circumstances warrant.
J. Street drainage shall not be permitted to cross intersections or the
crown of the road.
K. Stormwater roof drains shall not discharge water directly over a
sidewalk.
L. Stabilized outlets shall be provided for footer drains, flood drains, and
downspouts.
M. No person shall block, impede the flow of, alter, construct any
structure, or deposit any material or thin, or commit any act which will
affect normal or flood flow in any stream or watercourse without having
obtained prior approval from the Borough and/or DEP or other
regulatory agency, whichever is applicable.
N. Where a stormwater detention basin is proposed, the plan shall include
a proposal to prevent such basin from becoming a safety hazard or
public nuisance and for regular perpetual maintenance of the basin to
insure its continuous effectiveness.
§ 93-15 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 93-16
93:291
§ 93-16. Ground water recharge (infiltration/recharge/retention).
A. The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge capacity
of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the infiltration/
recharge stormwater management facilities shall give consideration to
providing ground water recharge to compensate for the reduction in
the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved and
roofed over. These measures are encouraged, particularly in hydrologic
soil groups B and C and shall be utilized wherever feasible. Soils used
for the construction of basins shall have low-erodibility factors ("K"
factors).
(1) Percent volume method.
Rev = [(S)(Rv)(A)]/12
where: Rev = 0.05 + 0.009(I) where I is percent impervious
cover
A = site area in acres
(2) Percent area method.
Rev = (S)(Ai)
where: Ai = the measured impervious cover
Hydrologic Soil Group Soil Specific Recharge Factor (S)
A 0.39
B 0.26
C 0.14
D 0.07
The recharge volume is considered part of the total WQv that must
be provided at a site and can be achieved either by a structural
practice (e.g., infiltration, bioretention), a nonstructural practice
(e.g., buffers, disconnection of rooftops), or a combination of both.
Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no proposed
disturbance during development may be excluded from the Rev
calculations. Designers are encouraged to use these areas as
nonstructural practices for Rev treatment.
Note: Rev and WQv are inclusive. When treated separately, the
Rev may be subtracted from the WQv when sizing the water
quality BMP.
B. Basis for determining recharge volume.
(1) If more than one HSG is present at a site, a composite soil specific
recharge factor shall be computed based on the proportion of total
site area within each HSG. The recharge volume provided at the
site shall be directed to the most permeable HSG available.
§ 93-16 § 93-16
93:292
(2) The "percent volume" method is used to determine the Rev
treatment requirement when structural practices are used to
provide recharge. These practices must provide seepage into the
ground and may include infiltration and exfiltration structures
(e.g., infiltration, bioretention, dry swales or sand filters with
storage below the underdrain). Structures that require
impermeable liners, intercept groundwater, or are designed for
trapping sediment (e.g., forbays) may not be used. In this method,
the volume of runoff treated by structural practices shall meet or
exceed the computed recharge volume.
(3) The "percent area" method is used to determine the Rev treatment
requirements when nonstructural practices are used. Under this
method, the recharge requirements are evaluated by mapping the
percent of impervious area that is effectively treated by an
acceptable nonstructural practice and comparing it to the
minimum recharge requirements.
(4) Acceptable nonstructural practices include filter strips that treat
rooftop or parking lot runoff sheet flow discharge to stream buffers,
and grass channels that treat roadway runoff.
(5) The recharge volume criterion does not apply to any portion of a
site designated as a stormwater hotspot or any project considered
as redevelopment. In addition the Borough Council may alter or
eliminate the recharge volume requirement if the site is situated on
unsuitable soils (e.g., marine clays, karst, or in an urban
redevelopment area). In this situation, nonstructural practices
(percent area method) shall be implemented to the maximum
extent practicable and the remaining or untreated Rev included in
the WQv treatment.
(6) If Rev is treated by structural or nonstructural practices separate
and upstream of the WQv treatment, the WQv is adjusted
accordingly.
C. Soils evaluation. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be
performed to determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The
evaluation shall be performed by a qualified professional, and at a
minimum, address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to
sinkhole formation, and subgrade stability.
(1) Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone
areas. Extreme caution shall also be exercised where salt or
chloride would be a pollutant since soils do little to filter this
pollutant and it may contaminate the groundwater. It is also
extremely important that the design professional evaluates the
possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration/recharge facility and recommend a hydrogeologic
justification study be performed if necessary. Whenever a basin will

§ 93-17. Water quality requirements.
In addition to the general standards and design criteria requirements of
Article III of this chapter, the land developer shall comply with the following
water quality requirements unless otherwise exempted by provisions of this
chapter.
be located in an area underlain by limestone, a geological
evaluation of the proposed location shall be conducted to
determine susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The design of all
facilities over limestone formations shall include measures to
prevent ground water contamination and, where necessary,
sinkhole formation.
(a) The Borough may require the installation of an impermeable
liner in detention basins. A detailed hydrogeologic
investigation may be required by the Borough. The Borough
may require the developer to provide safeguards against
groundwater contamination for uses which may cause
groundwater contamination, should there be a mishap or spill.
(b) It shall be the developer's responsibility to verify if the site is
underlain by limestone. The following note shall be attached to
all drainage plans and signed and sealed by the developer's
engineer/surveyor/landscape architect/geologist:
"I, ____________________. certify that the proposed detention
basin (circle one) is/is not underlain by limestone."
(2) Where previous pavement is permitted for parking lots,
recreational facilities, nondedicated streets, or other areas,
pavement construction specifications shall be noted on the plan.
(3) Recharge/infiltration facilities may be used in conjunction with
other innovative or traditional BMPs, stormwater control facilities,
and nonstructural stormwater management alternatives.
(4) All recharge/infiltration facilities shall be designed to completely
drain within 72 hours of reaching maximum capacity.
A. For water quality, the objective is to provide adequate storage to
capture and treat the runoff from 90% of the average annual rainfall. P
represents the depth of rain associated with 90% of the total rainfall
events over 0.11 inches.
(1) The size of the water quality facility shall be based upon the
following equation:
WQv = (1.1) (Rv)(A)/12 P = 1.1 inches of rainfall
Where: WQv = water quality volume (in ac-ft)
§ 93-16 § 93-17
93:294
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I) where I is percent impervious
cover
A = area in ac
(2) Treatment of the WQv shall be provided at all developments where
stormwater management is required. A minimum WQv of 0.2
inches per acre shall be met at sites or in drainage areas that have
less than 15% impervious cover.
(3) Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no proposed
disturbance during development may be excluded from the WQv
calculations. Designers are encouraged to use these areas as
nonstructural practices for WQv treatment.
(4) The design of the facility shall consider and minimize the chances
of clogging and sedimentation potential. Orifices smaller than 3
inches diameter are not recommended. However, if the Design
Engineer can provide proof that the smaller orifices are protected
from clogging by use of trash racks, etc., smaller orifices may be
permitted.
B. To accomplish Subsection A, above, the land developer may submit
original and innovative designs to the Borough Council for review and
approval. Such designs may achieve the water quality objectives
through a combination of BMPs.
C. In selecting the appropriate BMPs or combinations thereof, the land
developer shall consider the following:
(1) Total contributing area.
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(3) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(4) Seasonal high water table.
(5) Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
(6) Erodibility of soils.
(7) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
D. The following additional factors should be considered when evaluating
the suitability of BMPs used to control water quality at a given
development site:
(1) Peak discharge and required volume control.
(2) Streambank erosion.
(3) Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality
problems.
§ 93-17 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 93-17
93:295
§ 93-18. Streambank protection requirements.
(4) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
(5) The nature of the pollutant being removed.
(6) Maintenance requirements.
A. Streambank protection shall be considered in implementing general
standards pursuant to § 93-15. If a stormwater storage facility needs to
be constructed then, to protect channels from erosion, the outflow
structure shall be designed to provide the twenty-four-hour extended
detention of the one-year twenty-four-hour storm event. The method for
determining the Cpv requirement is detailed in Appendix C of this
chapter.54
B. Basis for determining channel protection storage volume.
(1) The models HEC-HMS, TR-55 and TR-20 (or an equivalent
approved by the Borough Council) shall be used for determining
peak discharge rates.
(2) Rainfall depth for the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm event in
Dauphin County is 2.5 inches.
(3) Off-site areas shall be modeled as present land use in good
condition for the one-year storm event.
(4) The length of overland flow used in time of concentration (tc)
calculations is limited to no more than 150 feet.
(5) The Cpv storage volume shall be computed using procedures
outlined in Appendix C of this chapter.55
(6) Cpv is not required at sites where the one-year postdevelopment
peak discharge (qi) is less than or equal to 2.0 cfs. A Cpv orifice
diameter (do) of less than 3.0 inches is subject to approval by the
Borough Council and is not recommended unless an internal
control for orifice protection is used.
(7) Cpv shall be addressed for the entire site. If a site consists of
multiple drainage areas, Cpv may be distributed proportionately to
each drainage area.
(8) Extended detention storage provided for the Cpv does not meet the
WQv requirement (i.e., Cpv and WQv shall be treated separately).
(9) The stormwater storage needed for the Cpv may be provided above
the WQv storage in stormwater ponds and wetlands; thereby
meeting all storage criteria except Rev in a single facility with

The Borough Council, upon the recommendation of the Commission,
shall act on any such preliminary plat not later than 90 days following
the date of the regular meeting of the Borough Council or the Planning
Commission (whichever first reviews the application) next following the
date the application is filed, or after a final order of court remanding an
application, provided that, should the said next regular meeting occur
more than 30 days following the filing of the application, or the final
order of court, the said ninety-day period shall be measured from the
30th day following the day the application has been filed. In the event
that any alteration of requirements from this chapter is requested by
the applicant or is deemed necessary by the Commission for approval,
the alteration and the reason for its necessity shall be entered in the
records of the Commission.
C. The Dauphin County Planning Commission shall review the preliminary
plat and shall provide one copy of a written review report to the
Planning Commission within 30 days.
D. The Borough Council shall determine whether the preliminary plat shall

§ 99-13 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-13
99:365
must do so in writing or orally (if such concurrence occurs at a public
meeting where concurrence may be reflected in the official minutes).
The concurrence or rejection of the applicant on conditions must occur
in a timely fashion so as to permit approval or disapproval of the
application (or plat) within the time limitation set forth in Subsection
B above. Approval of a plat subject to conditions shall be reconciled
automatically upon the applicant's failure to accept or reject such
conditions in the timely fashion set forth above. Such automatic
recision shall be deemed a disapproval, and the applicant shall be so
notified in the manner set forth in Subsections E and G hereof.
G. When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision
shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the
provisions of this chapter and/or the provisions of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247.67
H. Failure of the Borough Council to render a decision and communicate it
to the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall
be deemed an approval of the application in terms as presented unless
the applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in
the prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the
decision, in which case, failure to meet the extended time or change in
manner of presentation of communication shall have like effect. (A
sample "Agreement to Extend the Time for Rendering and
Communicating a Decision on Certain Preliminary and/or Final
Subdivision Plans" is contained in Exhibit III herein.68)
I. Approval of the preliminary plat constitutes approval of the proposed
subdivision or land development with respect to the general design, the
approximate dimensions and other planned features. Preliminary
approval binds the developer to the general scheme of the plat as
approved. Preliminary approval does not authorize the recording, sale
or transfer of lots or the installation of improvements.
J. Preliminary approval shall expire within five years after being granted.
An extension of time may be requested by the applicant and approved
by the Borough Council in accordance with 508(4) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as amended.69 Request for
extension shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer 30 days
prior to any prevailing expiration date. Extensions may be granted for
no more than three one-year periods.
K. In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by
the owner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed sections as
well as deadlines within which applications for final plat approval of

each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be updated
annually by the applicant on or before the anniversary of the
preliminary plat approval, until final plat approval of the final section
has been granted and any modification in the aforesaid schedule shall
be subject to approval of the Borough Council in its discretion.
L. Each section in any residential subdivision or land development, except
for the last section, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the total number
of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser
percentage is approved by the Borough Council in its discretion.
Provided the owner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any of
the conditions of the preliminary plat approval, including compliance
with owner's aforesaid schedule of submission of final plats for the
various sections, then the aforesaid protections afforded by
substantially completing the improvements depicted upon the final plat
within five years shall apply and for any section or sections, beyond the
initial section, in which the required improvements have not been
substantially completed within said five-year period the aforesaid
protections shall apply for an additional term or terms of three years
from the date of final plat approval for each section.
M. Failure of owner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of submission of
final plats for the various sections shall subject any such section to any

such problems as may be thereby identified.
(13) Stormwater management:
(a) A stormwater management plan shall be prepared and
stormwater drainage facilities required, as necessary, to:
73.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 99-14 § 99-14
99:370
[1] Permit the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses;
[2] Ensure the drainage of all low points along the line of
streets and other applicable areas;
[3] Intercept, retain, or detain surface water runoff in a
manner reasonably related to the extent and grade of the
area drained;
[4] Provide positive drainage away from buildings;
[5] Post-development peak flows should be less than or equal
to pre-development peak flows and the discharge to
downstream properties should be in a manner similar to
the pre-development condition.
(b) General standards
[1] The stormwater management plan shall contain and
illustrate the following: the mapping of the watershed area
or areas in which the proposed subdivision or land
development is located; calculations of runoff based on
either the Soils Cover Complex Method or Rational
Method, as approved by the Borough Engineer; the
complete drainage system for the subdivision or land
development including the identification of drainage
features which will be incorporated into the design. If the
subdivision or land development is to be developed in
phases, an overall stormwater management plan for the
entire site shall be submitted with the first phase and
appropriate future development phases for the drainage
system shall be indicated; the advice of the Borough
Engineer shall be sought in designing the stormwater
management plan.
[2] The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without the written
approval of the affected owners.
[3] Stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall not be
diverted so as to overload existing drainage systems, or
create flooding or the need for additional drainage
structures on other private properties or public lands,
without approved provisions being made by the applicant
for properly handling such conditions.
[4] Facilities for storm drainage shall be designed to handle
the anticipated peak discharge from the property being
subdivided as well as to handle the anticipated increase in
runoff that will occur when all the property at a higher
elevation in the same watershed area is fully developed.
§ 99-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-14
99:371
[5] Where a watercourse runs across or through a subdivision,
a drainage easement, which conforms to the line of such
watercourse, shall be provided at such a width as will be
adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural
drainage.
[6] All drainage structures that are located on the rights-ofway
of state highways shall be approved by PennDOT, and
a letter of approval from that office shall be directed to the
Commission.
[7] All streets shall be designed so that surface water is
discharged from their rights-of-way. The slope of the crown
on proposed streets shall not be less than 1/8 of an inch
per foot and not greater than 1/3 of an inch per foot.
[8] Storm drainage facilities, as required, shall be placed in
front of the curb or curbline when located in a street rightof-
way. When located in undedicated land, they shall be
placed within an easement, as approved by the Borough
Engineer, who may require additional width of easement
as circumstances warrant.
[9] Street drainage shall not be permitted to cross
intersections or the crown of the road.
[10] Stormwater roof drains shall not discharge water directly
over a sidewalk.
[11] Stabilized outlets shall be provided for footer drains, flood
drains, and downspouts.
[12]No person shall block, impede the flow of, alter, construct
any structure, or deposit any material or thing, or commit
any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any stream
or watercourse without having obtained prior approval
from the Borough and/or DEP or other regulatory agency,
whichever is applicable.
[13] Where a stormwater detention basin is proposed, the plan
shall include a proposal to prevent such basin from
becoming a safety hazard or public nuisance and for
regular perpetual maintenance of the basin to insure its
continuous effectiveness.
(14)Water supply.
(a) The applicant shall provide an adequate and potable water
supply and distribution system to service the proposed
subdivision or land development through one of the following
methods listed in their orders of preference:
§ 99-14 § 99-14
99:372
[1] Connection to a public water supply system where such a
system is within 1,000 feet of the proposed development
site and where the capacity of such a system can
adequately fulfill the water supply demands of the
proposed development, including fire protection. A
distribution system shall be designed to furnish an
adequate supply of water to each lot. A copy of the
approval of such a system by the appropriate public
authority or utility company shall be submitted with the
final plan.
[2] Where a public water supply system cannot feasibly be
provided to the proposed development, as evidenced by an
evaluation study, the feasibility of constructing a separate
water supply system shall be investigated and a report
submitted setting forth the findings. If such a system is
provided, it shall be reviewed and approved by the DEP
and suitable agreements including financial guaranties
shall be established for the ownership and maintenance of
the system. Also, such a system shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that would permit adequate
connection to a public water supply system in the future.
[3] Where neither of the above alternatives are possible or
feasible, either an individual on-lot or a community water
supply system may be permitted pursuant to a compliance
with this section. All such individual or community systems
shall also meet the criteria of the DEP.
[4] All water systems located in flood-prone areas shall be
floodproofed to a point on 1 1/2 feet above the onehundred-
year flood elevation.
(b) Individual on-lot wells or community water system:
[1] In subdivisions or land developments proposing to utilize
individual on-lot wells or a community water supply,
Borough Council reserves the right to require the
applicant to drill and test a well(s) and have a report
prepared on the quantity and quality of groundwater at the
site.
[2] Such requirement for a test well(s) and report may be
invoked at the discretion of the Borough Council in
situations where (1) the area is known to have actual water
yield or quality problems; or (2) the Pennsylvania State
Water Plan or U.S. Geological Survey Water Resource
Reports, or other technical study indicates a potential low
yield area or inadequate water quality area; or (3) the
development consists of 25 proposed lots or units with an
average density of less than one unit per acre or involves a
§ 99-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-14
99:373
withdrawal of 10,000 or more gallons per day. The
requirement may also be invoked when the 26th or
subsequent lots or units are proposed to be developed
from the original or parent tract. The contents of the
report or study of the proposed community water system
shall include those specific items as described in the Public
Water Supply Manual of the DEP. Where the water supply
system occurs under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania
Public Utilities Commission (PUC), the water supply study
shall also incorporate those items of information required
by the PUC.
[3] When individual on-lot wells are proposed, the subdivider
shall either install such facilities or put a restriction in the
deed of each lot indicating that no building intended for
residential, commercial, or industrial use shall take place
on said lot until such time that a satisfactory well is
provided or as a condition of the sale of each lot or parcel
within the same subdivision or land development, that the
facilities can be installed by the purchaser of such lot and
have minimum yield of potable water of 500 GPD prior to
sale. The owner or subdivider shall provide the Borough
Council with proof of compliance with this section.
Construction of wells for individual small water supplies
shall conform to DEP's Construction Standards Individual
Water Supplies, as revised. Individual on-site wells shall be
subject to the following standards:
(c) Location. The source of supply shall be from a water-bearing
formation not less than 25 feet from the ground surface. Cap
wells shall be located at a point free from flooding and at a
higher elevation and at the following minimum distances to
existing or potential sources of pollution:
Source of Pollution
Minimum Distance

(d) Sources of groundwater for community water systems. It is
recommended that two sources of groundwater be provided for
each public or community water system. Each should be
capable of supplying the average daily demand of the proposed
dwelling units. Although a two-well system is ideal, there are
alternatives which would ensure an adequate water supply:
[1] A single well capable of providing twice the ultimate daily
average demand as demonstrated by a pumping test of at
least 48 hours' duration producing a stabilized draw down
of unchanging water level for at least five hours' duration.
[2] A single well capable of supplying the average daily
demand with an additional reliable surface water source.
§ 99-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-14
99:375
§ 99-15. Final plat: procedures.
[3] A single well capable of supplying the average daily
demand plus a dependable connection to another
satisfactory public water supply system.
[4] A second well is recommended for use as a monitor of the
aquifer and as a standby in the event of emergency.
A. The applicant shall, not later than five years after the date of approval
of the preliminary plat, for that portion intended to be developed, file
with the Borough Zoning Officer a final plat. Such filing shall include, as
part of the formal submission, all the material and other data required
under the final plat specifications as listed in § 99-16 of this chapter.
Failure to comply with the time limitation herein provided shall make
the approval of the preliminary plat null and void unless an extension of
time is granted in accordance with § 99-13 herein.
B. The final plat shall be submitted with a letter of transmittal requesting
review of the application a descriptive narrative of the proposed
subdivision and/or land development, and other necessary information.
The final plat shall incorporate all the changes and modifications
required by the Borough Council; otherwise it shall conform to the
approved preliminary plat, and it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which the applicant proposes to record and
develop at the time, provided that such portion conforms to all of the
requirements of this chapter.
C. One reproducible Mylar copy of the final plat and 10 prints shall be filed
by the applicant with the Borough's Zoning Officer 14 calendar days
prior to the meeting of the Planning Commission at which meeting
consideration is desired.
D. Completion of improvements or guaranty thereof prerequisite to final
plat approval.
(1) No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such
plat have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by
this chapter and any walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire
hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers
and other improvements as may be required by this chapter have
been installed in accordance with this chapter. In condition for the
final approval of a plat, including improvements or fees otherwise
required by this chapter, the developer may deposit with the
Borough financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the
costs of such improvements or common amenities including basins
and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open
space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required.
§ 99-14 § 99-15
99:376
(2) When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing,
the Borough Council shall furnish the developer with a signed copy
of a resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon
the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final
plat or record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the
financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or
letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be
revoked if the financial security agreement (see Exhibit IV for a
sample security agreement74) is not executed within 90 days of the
approval of the resolution unless a written extension is granted by
the Borough Council; such extension shall not be unreasonably
withheld and shall be placed in writing at the request of the
developer.
(3) Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Borough may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit (see Exhibit V for a sample letter of
credit75) and restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending
institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for the
purposes of this section.
(4) Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by
the party posting the financial security, provided said bonding
company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such
business within the commonwealth.
(5) Such bond, or other security, shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be required
on or before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or
accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements.
(6) The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually, the Borough may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost
for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
said adjustment, the Borough may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this subsection.
74.Editor's Note: Exhibit IV is included at the end of this chapter.
75.Editor's Note: Exhibit V is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 99-15 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-15
99:377
(7) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such cost. The Borough, upon the recommendation of the Borough
Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause
shown. If the applicant or developer and the Borough are unable to
agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated,
and recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in
this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Borough and the
applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the third engineer
shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final
estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for
the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the Borough
and the applicant or developer.
(8) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an
amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
(9) In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Borough Council may authorize submission of final plats by
sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guaranties as to improvements in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally
approved section of the development.
(10) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough
Council to release or authorize the release, from time to time, of
such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests
shall be in writing addressed to the Borough Council, and the
Borough Council shall have 45 days from receipt of such request
within which to allow the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, to
the Borough Council that such portion of the work upon the
improvements has been completed in accordance with the
approved plat. Upon such certification the Borough Council shall
authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of
an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed or, if the
Borough Council fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the
Borough Council shall be deemed to have approved the release of
funds as requested. The Borough Council may, prior to final release
§ 99-15 § 99-15
99:378
at the time of completion and certification by its engineer, require
retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid
improvements.
(11) Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Borough Council
may require the posting of financial security to secure structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plat for a term not to exceed 18 months from
the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall
be of the same type as otherwise required in this section with
regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of the
financial security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of
installation of said improvements.
(12) If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public
utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the
Borough, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the
regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise
required by this chapter.
(13) If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a
plat as set forth in this section, the Borough shall not condition the
issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the
erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon
the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat upon actual
completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final
plat. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided,
occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall
not be withheld following the improvement of the streets providing
access to and from existing public roads to such building or
buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or
beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are
necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or
buildings.
E. Release from improvement bond.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough
Council, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the Borough Engineer. The Borough Council or its
§ 99-15 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-15
99:379
designated agents shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice,
direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect all of the
aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer shall, thereupon,
file a report in writing, with the Borough Council, and shall
promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified
or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within
30 days after receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid
authorization from the Borough Council; said report shall be
detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said
improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements,
or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected
by the Borough Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of
reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
(2) The Borough Council shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered
mail of the action of said Borough Council with relation thereto.
(3) If the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all
improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the
developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant to its
performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
(4) If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall
proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
(5) Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Borough Council or the
Borough Engineer.
(6) Where herein reference is made to the Borough Engineer, he shall
be as a consultant thereto.
(7) The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Borough for the
reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection of
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by
resolution of the Borough Council and as from time to time
amended. Such expense shall be reasonable and in accordance
with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the Borough
Engineer or consultant for work performed for similar services in
the community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost
charged by the engineer or consultant to the Borough when fees
are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants.
(a) In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such
expense in connection with the inspection of improvements,
the applicant shall, within 10 working days of the date of
billing, notify the Borough that such expenses are disputed as
§ 99-15 § 99-15
99:380
unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the Borough shall
not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development
application or any approval or permit related to development
due to the applicant's request over disputed engineer
expenses.
(b) If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the Borough and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Borough
shall jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another
professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania to review the said expenses and make a
determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable
and necessary.
(c) The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such
evidence and review such documentation as the professional
engineer in his or her sole opinion deems necessary and render
a decision within 50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall
be required to pay the entire amount determined in the
decision immediately.
(d) In the event that the Borough and applicant cannot agree upon
the professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the
billing date, then, upon application of either party, the
President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of judicial
district in which the Borough is located (or if at the time there
be no President Judge, then the senior active judge then
sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case, shall be
neither the Borough Engineer nor any professional engineer
who has been retained by, or performed services for, the
Borough or the applicant within the preceding five years.
(e) The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining
the reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the
applicant if the amount of payment required in the decision is
equal to or greater than the original bill. If the amount of
payment required in the decision is less than the original bill by
$1,000 or more, the Borough shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the Borough and the
applicant shall each pay 1/2 of the fee of the appointed
professional engineer.
F. Before acting on any subdivision plat, the Borough Council may hold a
public hearing thereon after public notice.
G. The Borough Council, upon the recommendation of the Commission,
shall act on any such final plat not later than 90 days following the date
of the regular meeting of the Borough Council or the Planning
Commission (whichever first reviews the application) following the date
the application is filed, provided that, shall the said next regular
§ 99-15 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-15
99:381
meeting occur more than 30 days following the filing of the application,
the said ninety-day period shall be measured from the 30th day
following the day the application has been filed. In the event that
any alteration of requirements from this chapter is requested by the
applicant or is deemed necessary by the Commission for approval,
the alteration and the reason for its necessity shall be entered in the
records of the Commission.
H. The Borough Council shall determine whether the final plat shall be
approved, or disapproved, and shall notify the applicant in writing
thereof, including, if approved with conditions or disapproved, a
statement of reasons for such action, not later than 15 days following
the decision.
I. When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision
shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the
provisions of this chapter.
J. Failure of the Borough Council to render a decision and communicate it
to the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall
be deemed an approval of the application in terms as presented unless
the applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in
the prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the
decision, in which case, failure to meet the extended time or change in
manner of presentation of communication shall have like effect. (A
sample "Agreement to Extend the Time for Rendering and
Communicating a Decision on Certain Preliminary and/or Final
Subdivision/Land Development Plans" is contained in Exhibit III
herein.76)
K. No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made on any
final plat of a subdivision or land development after approval has been
given by the Borough Council, and endorsed in writing on the plat,
unless the plat is first resubmitted to the Borough Council.
L. Upon the approval of a final plat the Borough of Steelton shall within 90
days of such final approval record such plat in the Office of the
Recorder of Deeds of Dauphin County.
M. Whenever plat approval by the Borough Council is required, the
Dauphin County Recorder of Deeds shall not accept any plat for
recording unless such plat officially indicates the approval of the
Borough Council and review by the Dauphin County Planning
Commission.
N. In accordance with 508(4) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, Act 247, as amended,77 when an application for approval of a

ARTICLE V
Design Standards
§ 99-18. Application.
§ 99-19. Streets.
A. The following principles, standards, and requirements will be applied
by the Borough Council and Planning Commission in their review and
evaluation of all subdivision and land development plat applications.
B. The standards and requirements contained herein shall be considered
the minimum for the promotion of the public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare.
C. Where literal compliance with the standards and requirements
contained herein is clearly impractical, the Borough Council may
modify or waive such through the alteration of requirements process
set forth in Article VIII of this chapter.
D. Subdivision and land development plats shall give due consideration to
official plans of the Borough of Steelton, Dauphin County and region, or
to such parts thereof as may be adopted pursuant to statute.
E. Proposed land uses shall conform to Chapter 120, Zoning, of this Code,
as amended.
F. Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property, such as may arise
from fire, flood, disease, or other causes, shall not be platted for
development purposes unless such hazards have been eliminated or
unless the plat shall show adequate safeguards against them, which
shall be approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
A. General standards.
(1) Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or
parts thereof as have been officially adopted by the Borough of
Steelton and shall be coordinated with existing or proposed streets
in adjoining subdivisions or land developments. Further, proposed
streets shall be properly related to county, regional or state
transportation plans as have been prepared and adopted as
prescribed by law.
(2) Streets shall be laid out to preserve the integrity of their design.
Local access streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by
through traffic and, where possible, collector and arterial streets
shall be designed for use by through traffic.
(3) Streets shall be related to the topography so as to establish usable
lots and satisfactory street grades.
(4) Proposed street arrangements shall make provisions for the
continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas; the proper
§ 99-18 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-19
99:387
projection of streets into adjoining undeveloped or unplanted
areas; and the continuation of proposed streets to the boundaries
of the tract being subdivided.
(5) New half or partial streets shall be prohibited except where
essential to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with
the other requirements and standards of these regulations and
where, in addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication of the
remaining part of the street can be obtained.
(6) Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing or platted street
names, or approximate such names by the use of suffixes such as
"lane," "way," "drive," "court," "avenue." In approving the names of
streets, cognizance shall be given to existing or platted street
names within the postal delivery district served by the local post
office. New streets shall bear the same name or number of any
continuation of alignment with an existing or platted street.
(7) Insofar as possible, streets on which structures utilizing solar
access are proposed to front upon shall be oriented along an eastwest
axis with maximum deviations permitted up to 25 degrees;
provided that such orientations are feasible based on soil and slope
conditions and are a practical means of providing safe and
convenient access and circulation.
(8) Proposed private streets (streets not offered for dedication) are
prohibited.
(9) Proposed private service access for purposes of providing a means
of secondary access to a lot are permitted as deemed appropriate
by the Borough Council and Borough Engineer.
B. Street classification. Three functional classifications of streets and
roads, as classified in the Borough of Steelton Comprehensive Plan, are
established as follows:
(1) Arterial. This classification includes highways which provide
intracounty or intermunicipal traffic of substantial volumes.
Generally, these highways shall accommodate operating speeds of
55 miles per hour.
(2) Collector. This classification is intended to include those highways
which connect minor streets to arterial highways and generally
serve intracounty and intramunicipal traffic. They may serve as
traffic corridors connecting residential areas with industrial,
shopping and other services. They may penetrate residential areas.
Generally, these highways will accommodate operating speeds of
35 to 45 miles per hour or under.
(3) Minor. This classification is intended to include streets and roads
that provide direct access to abutting land and connections to
higher classes of roadways. Traffic volumes will be low and travel
§ 99-19 § 99-19
99:388
distances generally short. These streets and roads shall be
designed for operating speeds of 25 miles per hour or under.
C. Street widths.
(1) Minimum street right-of-way and cartway widths shall be required
as presented in Table 1.
(2) Provision for additional street width (right-of-way) may be required
when determined to be necessary by the Borough Council in
specific cases for:
(a) Public safety and convenience.
(b) Parking in commercial and industrial areas and in areas of high
density development (see Table 1).

D. Dead-end streets.
(1) Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed for future access
to adjoining properties.
(2) Any dead-end streets, for access to an adjoining property or
because of authorized phased development, shall be provided with
a temporary, all-weather turnaround within the subdivision or/and
land development; and the use of such turnaround shall be
guaranteed to the public until such time as the street is extended.
§ 99-19 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-19

(3) Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to the tract
boundary with sufficient additional width provided along the
boundary line to permit extension of the street at full width.
E. Culs-de-sac.
(1) Cul-de-sac streets serving residential uses, permanently designed
as such, shall not exceed 800 feet in length and shall not furnish

99:399
A. General standards.
(1) Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land
located in any identified floodplain area or district may be platted
for development with the provision that the developer construct all
buildings and structures to preclude flood damage in accordance
with this and any other local, state and federal laws and ordinances
regulating such development.
(2) Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any identified floodway
area or district. Sites for these uses may be permitted outside the
elevated 1 1/2 feet above the regulatory flood elevation. If fill is
used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area shall extend out
laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the
proposed structures.
(3) Building sites for structures or buildings other than for residential
uses shall not be permitted in any identified floodway area or
district. Also, such sites for structures or buildings outside the
floodway shall be protected as provided for in Subsection A(2)
above. However, the Borough Council may allow the subdivision
and/or development of areas or sites for commercial and industrial
uses at an elevation below the regulatory flood elevation if the
developer otherwise protects the area to that height or assures that
the buildings or structures will be floodproofed at least up to that
height.
(4) If the Zoning Officer determines that only a part of a proposed plat
can be safely developed, he shall limit development to that part and
shall require that development proceed consistent with this
determination.
(5) When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and
the Borough determines that additional controls are required to
insure safe development, it may require the developer to impose
appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions
shall be inserted in every deed and noted on every recorded plat.
B. Where any excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing
trees, shrubs or other vegetative cover will be removed, the developer
shall consult the County Conservation District representative
concerning plans for erosion and sediment control and to also obtain a
report on the soil characteristics of the site so that a determination can
be made as to the type and degree of development the site may
accommodate. Before undertaking any excavation or grading, the
developer shall obtain a grading and excavation permit, if such is
required.
C. Drainage facilities.
§ 99-26 § 99-26
99:400
§ 99-27. Recreation and open space.
(1) Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of
stormwater runoff in a safe and efficient manner. The system shall
insure proper drainage along streets and provide positive drainage
away from buildings.
(2) Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Borough. The Borough
may require a primarily underground system to accommodate
frequent floods and a secondary surface system to accommodate
larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with
local and regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be designed to
prevent the discharge or excess runoff onto adjacent properties.
D. Streets. The finished elevation of proposed streets and driveways shall
not be more than one foot below the regulatory flood elevation. The
Borough may require profiles and elevations of streets to determine
compliance with the requirements. Drainage openings shall be
sufficient to discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood
heights.
E. Sanitary sewer facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in any
designated floodplain district shall be floodproofed up to the regulatory
flood elevation.
F. Water facilities. All water systems located in any designated floodplain
district shall be floodproofed up to the regulatory flood elevation.
G. Other utilities and facilities. All other public and private utilities
including gas and electric shall be elevated or floodproofed to not less
than 1 1/2 feet above the regulatory flood elevation.
A. All residential subdivisions or land development plats submitted after
the effective date of this chapter shall provide for suitable and adequate
recreation in order to:
(1) Insure adequate recreational areas and facilities to serve the future
residents of the Borough;
(2) Maintain compliance with recreational standards as developed by
the National Recreation and Parks Association;
(3) Reduce increasing usage pressure on existing recreational areas
and facilities;
(4) Insure that all present and future residents have the opportunity to
engage in many and varied recreational pursuits; and to
(5) Reduce the possibility of the Borough becoming overburdened with
the development and maintenance of many very small, randomly
planned and widely separated recreation areas.
B. Exemptions and requirements.
§ 99-26 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-27
99:401
(1) The following are exempt or partially exempt from the provisions of

development plan in a residential zone classification for which
a preliminary plan has been submitted prior to the effective
date of this chapter.
(b) Any residential subdivision or land development plan, whether
single and/or multifamily, that contains less than 30 dwelling
units may be exempted by the Borough Council from
dedicating land for recreational purposes, but shall pay the fee
in lieu of dedication as provided in this chapter. Yard
extensions shall be excluded from this requirement.
(2) The amount of land required to be provided for recreational
purposes for residential subdivisions or land development plans not
exempted from the provisions of this chapter shall be as follows:
(a) Single-family developments. In the case of a single-family
subdivision, the developer shall provide a minimum of 1,500
square feet per lot.
(b) Multiple-family developments. In multiple-family
developments, a minimum contiguous area of 10% of the total
area shall be provided for recreation exclusive of roadways of
the land being developed.
(3) A maximum of 25% of the total land area required by this chapter
to be provided for recreation may consist of floodplain areas.
(4) Such land set aside shall be suitable to serve the purpose of active
and/or passive recreation by reason of its size, shape, location and
topography and shall be subject to the approval of the Borough
Council.
(5) The developer shall satisfy the Borough Council that there are
adequate provisions to assure retention and all future maintenance
of such recreation area by maintaining ownership, or by providing
for and establishing an organization (e.g., homeowners'
association) for the ownership and maintenance of the recreation
area and such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it
dispose of the recreation area by sale or otherwise, except to an
organization conceived and established to own and maintain the
recreation area without first offering to dedicate the same to the
Borough.
C. Recreation area location criteria. The Planning Commission and the
Borough Council, in exercising their duties regarding the approval of
subdivision and land development plans, shall consider the following
criteria in determining whether to approve the proposed location of
§ 99-27 § 99-27
99:402
recreation areas in the developer's subdivision and land development
plans:
(1) Site or sites shall be easily and safely accessible from all areas of
the development to be served, have good ingress and egress and
have access to a public road; however, no public road shall traverse
the site or sites.
(2) Site or sites shall have suitable topography and soil conditions for
use and development as a recreation area.
(3) Size and shape for the site or sites shall be suitable for
development as a particular type of park. Sites will be categorized
by the Borough using the standards established by the National
Recreation and Parks Association. (Publication Number 10005, as
revised).
(4) When designing and developing these recreation areas, it shall be
done according to the standards established by the National
Recreation and Parks Association.
(5) Site or sites shall, to the greatest extent practical, be easily
accessible to essential utilities, such as water, sewer and electric.
(6) Site or sites shall meet minimum size requirements for usable
acreage with respect to National Recreation and Parks Association
standards with 75% of such area having a maximum slope of 7%.
(7) Recreation sites shall be located in such a manner which allows
maximum practical solar access to neighboring structures.
(8) Where open space is being provided, it shall be located, wherever
possible, to provide a buffer from the shading effects of taller
structures or obstructions on existing or proposed shorter
buildings.
D. Dedication to municipality.
(1) In a case where the developer does not wish to retain the required
recreation area, such area may be offered for dedication to the
Borough for public use.
(2) In addition to approving the recreation site areas to be dedicated to
the Borough, the Planning Commission shall make its
recommendation to the Borough Council as to whether the
dedication shall be accepted by the Borough.
(3) Such areas dedicated to the Borough for public use shall be
suitable for recreational purposes by reason of size, shape,
location, topography and access.
(4) The Planning Commission may find dedication to be impractical
because of the size, shape, location, access, topography, drainage
§ 99-27 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 99-27
99:403
or other physical features of the land and that such dedication
would adversely affect the subdivision or land development and
its future residents or occupants, or that there is no land area
within the proposed subdivision which is practical for dedication
to the public because of size, access, topography or other physical
characteristics.
(5) When the Borough Council deems it to be in the public interest to
accept dedicated land, such acceptance shall be by means of a
signed resolution to which the property description of the
dedicated recreation area shall be attached.
E. Fee in lieu of dedication.
(1) Where the Borough Council agrees with the developer that because
of the size, shape, location, access, topography or other physical
features of the land that it is impractical to dedicate land to the
Borough or set aside a recreation area as required by this section,
the Borough Council shall require a payment of a fee in lieu of
dedication of such land which shall be payable to the Borough prior
to approval of each final section of the overall plan by the Borough
Council. Such fee shall be calculated by multiplying the number of
dwelling units in each section by the fee per dwelling unit.
(2) The amount of the fee shall be set from time to time by resolution of
the Borough Council.
(3) All monies paid to the Borough Council pursuant to this section
shall be used only for the acquisition of and/or capital
improvements for park and recreation purposes.

§ 99-41. Screening.
Screening shall be provided as required by this chapter. The purpose of
screening is provide an effective visual barrier and to protect property
against traffic, trespass, noise, heat, glare, dust, unsightly or distracting
activity, to preserve property values, and assure compatibility of uses.
A. The following list describes various levels of screening:
(1) Level One: This buffer shall contain screening materials which, at
maturity, provide intermittent visual obstruction from the ground
to a height of four feet as well as intermittent visual obstruction
from a height of four feet to a height of 30 feet. Vegetative
screening materials within intermittent visual obstruction areas
shall contain horizontal openings no greater than 20 feet in width
upon the plant's maturity. Grouping of plant materials is
encouraged to achieve a more natural appearance. The pictures at
the end of this section are meant to illustrate this point.83
(a) Evergreen trees: minimum five-foot planting height.
(b) Deciduous trees: minimum two-inch caliper and six-foot
planting height.
(c) Shrubs: eighteen-inch planting height, reaching a minimum of
30 inches within two years. All shrubs (deciduous or
evergreen) must have a minimum spread of 12 to 15 inches
when planted.
(d) Minimum planting width: 10 feet.
(2) Level Two: This buffer shall contain screening materials which, at
maturity, provide semiopacity from the ground to a height of six
feet and intermittent visual obstruction from a height of six feet to a
height of 30 feet. Vegetative screening materials within
intermittent visual obstruction areas shall contain horizontal
openings no greater than 20 feet in width; and vegetative screening
material within semiopaque areas shall contain openings no
greater than 15 feet in width upon the plant's maturity. Grouping of
plant material is encouraged to achieve a more natural appearance.

and efficient circulation system that includes facilities for pedestrians. It
is the intent of this section to provide a set of minimum standards for
the location of sidewalks for the purpose of providing safe and convenient
transportation routes for pedestrians, protecting the public safety, reducing
traffic congestion by encouraging alternative modes of transportation,
promoting the recreational use of sidewalks, encouraging a social focus for
residents, insuring the quality of pedestrian facilities are equal to or above
automobile-related facilities.
erosion, with slopes greater that 3:1 up to 2:1 maximum
slope, and eight-foot minimum top width.
[2] Groundcover, shrubs and trees: adequate to achieve a
continuous bed of vegetative cover over at least 95% of the
berm within two years of planting, groundcover and
shrubs to be chosen from the listing titled Vegetation
Acceptable for Erosion Control, and composition adequate
to achieve a solid screen from zero-foot to six-foot height
two years after planting considering the expected plant
size two years after planting.

the "Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code," Act 247, Article V, as
amended.87
A. The Borough Council shall have the duty and authority for the
administration and general enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter, as specified or implied herein. Officials of the Borough of

of this chapter, as specified or implied herein or in other ordinances of
the Borough.
B. Permits required by the Borough of Steelton for the erection or
alteration of buildings, the installation of sewers or for other
appurtenant improvements to or use of the land, shall not be issued by
any Borough of Steelton official responsible for such issuance until it

§ 99-55. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final
plat, the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any
corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient
to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Borough Council may, at its
option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action
to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such
security, and not for any other Borough purpose.
§ 99-56. Preventive remedies.
A. In addition to other remedies, the Borough may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The

documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the
remedies herein provided.
B. The Borough may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has
been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real
property in violation of this chapter. This authority to deny such a
permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
(1) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(2) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(3) The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(4) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as
to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
C. As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an
approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the Borough may require

§ 99-57. Violations and penalties; enforcement remedies.
compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to the
property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real
property.
A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable in a civil
enforcement proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment
of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable
attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof. No judgment
shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the District Justice. If the defendant
neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce
the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless the District Justice determining that there has been a violation
further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership, or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that
there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to
have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date
of the determination of a violation by the District Justice, and thereafter
each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.

The following words and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.

DOMICILE  The place where one lives and has his permanent home
and to which he has the intention of returning whenever he is absent.
An actual residence is not necessarily a domicile, for domicile is the fixed

than transitory. Domicile is the place in which a man has voluntarily fixed
the habitation of himself and his family, not for a mere special or limited
purpose, but with the present intention of making a permanent home until
some event occurs to induce him to adopt some other permanent home. In
the case of businesses or associations, the domicile is that place considered
as the center of business affairs and the place where its functions are
discharged.

payments, fees, tips and other compensation received by a person or his
personal representative for services rendered, whether directly or through
an agent and whether in cash or in property, not including, however, wages
or compensation paid to persons on active military service; periodic
payments for sickness and disability other than regular wages received
during a period of sickness; disability or retirement or payments arising
under workers' compensation acts, occupational disease acts and similar
legislation; or payments commonly recognized as old age benefits,
retirement pay or pensions paid to persons retired from service after
reaching a specific age or after a stated period of employment; or payments
commonly known as public assistance; or unemployment compensation
payments made by any governmental agency or payments to reimburse

salary supplemental programs, including but not limited to programs
covering hospitalization, sickness, disability or death, supplemental
unemployment benefits, strike benefits, social security and retirement.

governmental body or unit or agency, or any other entity employing one or
more persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.

agency designated by the Council of the Borough of Steelton to collect and
administer the tax on earned income and net profits.

prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer, then the tax levied by the Borough Council of the Borough of
Steelton under the authority of that Act shall, during the time such
duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided,
be 1/2 of the rate, and such one-half rate shall become effective without
any action on the part of the Borough Council of the Borough of
Steelton; provided, however, that the Borough of Steelton and any other
political subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2
of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under the Local Tax Enabling Act.

effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

and child or the spouse of such child, between brother and sister or

granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a
beneficiary of an ordinary trust.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from trustee to

reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.

90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family

previously sold under a land contract by the grantor, a credit for the
amount of the tax paid at the time of the sale shall be given the grantor
toward the tax due upon the deed.

(2) Road construction and/or maintenance; or

occupation which requires his working in more than one political

required by this article shall, upon a summary conviction before the District
Justice, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 for each offense
and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, be imprisoned in the local
or Dauphin County jail for a period not exceeding 30 days for each offense.
It is further provided that the action to enforce the fine and penalty herein
provided may be instituted against any person in charge of the business
of any employer who has failed or refused to file a return required by this
article.

ARTICLE IV
Metered Parking
§ 110-28. Designation of parking spaces.
The Police Department is hereby authorized to provide for the marking off
of individual parking spaces in the parking zones and areas designated and
described in § 110-36, said parking spaces to be designated by lines painted
or marked on the curbing or surface of the highway or area. At each space
so marked off, it shall be unlawful to park any vehicle in such a way that said
vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so designated.
§ 110-29. Installation of meters; operation.
§ 110-30. Manner of parking.
A. In said parking meter zones, parking meters shall be installed upon the
curb, sidewalk or pavement immediately adjacent to the parking spaces
provided in § 110-36 of this article. The Police Department shall be
responsible for the regulation, control, operation, maintenance and use
of such parking meters.
B. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal parking
upon the deposit of the appropriate coin, for the period of time
hereinafter prescribed. Each device shall be so arranged that upon the
expiration of the lawful time limit it will indicate by a proper, visible
signal that the lawful parking period has expired, and in such case, the
right of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease, and the operator,
owner, possessor or manager hereof shall be subject to the penalties
hereinafter provided.
A. When a parking space in any parking meter zone is parallel with the
adjacent curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parking in such parking space
shall be parked so that the foremost part of such vehicle shall be
nearest to the parking meter; provided, however, that where double
parking meters are installed upon one standard so as to serve two
parking spaces, any vehicle parked in the space just beyond the parking
meters shall be parked so that the rear bumper of such vehicle shall be
nearest to the parking meters. When a parking space in any parking
meter zone is diagonal to the curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in
such parking space shall be parked with the foremost part of such
vehicle nearest to such meter.
B. Where lines or markings are painted or placed upon the curb, sidewalk,
highway and/or paved surface adjacent to each parking meter providing
for parking at an angle and not parallel or perpendicular to the curb, it
shall be unlawful for the operator of any motor vehicle to cross the
center line of the highway to enter or leave said parking area.
§ 110-28 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 110-31
110:573
§ 110-31. Deposit of coins.
When any vehicle shall be parked in any space adjacent to which a parking
meter is located in accordance with the provisions of this article, the
operator shall, upon entering the said parking space, immediately deposit
or cause to be deposited such coin or coins of the United States as is
required for such parking meter and as is designated by proper instructions
on the parking meter, and failure to deposit such coin or coins shall
constitute a breach of this article and shall subject each person to the
penalty prescribed hereafter. Upon the deposit of such coin or coins and
placing said meter in operation, the parking space may be lawfully occupied
by such vehicle during the period of parking time which has been
prescribed for the zone in which said parking space is located, and for
which a coin or coins is or are deposited, as indicated on the parking meter.
If said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the
parking time limit so fixed for such parking space, the parking meter shall,
by its violation signal, dial or pointer, indicate such illegal parking, and
in that event, such vehicle shall be considered as parked overtime and
beyond the period of legal parking time. The parking of a vehicle overtime
or beyond the period of legal parking time in any such space where any such
parking meter is located shall be a violation of this article and punishable
as hereinafter set forth.
§ 110-32. Violations.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of the provisions of this article for any
person:
A. To cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered in the name of or
operated by such person to be parked overtime or beyond the period of
legal parking time established for any parking meter zone as herein
described, or to deposit in any parking meter any coin for the purpose
of parking beyond the maximum legal parking time for the particular
parking meter zone; where the maximum legal parking time is
consecutively exceeded by the same vehicle, each such violation shall
constitute a separate violation, i.e., if the maximum legal parking time
is two hours and that time is exceeded by a vehicle, a violation occurs; if
the same vehicle remains after four hours, a second violation occurs;
after six hours, a third violation; and so on, ad infinitum. [Amended
5-17-1982 by Ord. No. 82-2]
B. To permit any vehicle to remain or be placed in any parking space
adjacent to any parking meter while said meter is displaying a signal
indicating that the vehicle occupying such parking space has already
been parked beyond the period prescribed for such parking space;
where the maximum legal parking time is consecutively exceeded by
the same vehicle, each such violation shall constitute a separate
violation, i.e., if the maximum legal parking time is two hours and that
time is exceeded by a vehicle, a violation occurs; if the same vehicle
remains after four hours, a second violation occurs; after six hours, a

(a) The applicant for special exception demonstrates that the
proposed use does not constitute a violation of Subsections
S(1) through (8) hereinafter set forth.
(b) The applicant for special exception demonstrates that all other
provisions of this chapter are being met in relation to the
zoning district in which the proposed use is to be located.
(2) A person is guilty of a violation of this chapter if he or she operates
or causes to be operated a sexually oriented business within 500
feet of: [Amended 12-6-1999 by Ord. No. 99-9, approved
12-6-1999]
(a) A public library.
(b) A public park adjacent to any residential district.
(c) A church.
(d) A school.
(3) A person is guilty of a violation of this chapter if he or she causes or
permits the operation, establishment, substantial enlargement or
transfer of ownership or control of a sexually oriented business
within 500 feet of another sexually oriented business.
(4) A person is guilty of a violation of this chapter if he or she causes or
permits the operation, establishment or maintenance of more than
one sexually oriented business in the same building, structure or
portion thereof; or the increase of floor areas of any sexually
oriented business in any building, structure or portion thereof
containing another sexually oriented business.

A. This article is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by 1984
Pennsylvania Laws, P.L. 837, No. 164, codified at 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5911 et
seq., and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 (53
P.S. § 10101 et seq.).
B. It is hereby found that an obstruction (as defined herein) has the
potential for endangering the lives and property of users of the Borough
of Steelton and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an
obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach
minimums of the Capital City and Harrisburg International Airports;
and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the
landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or
impair the utility of the Capital City and Harrisburg International
Airports and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared
that:
(1) The creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential of
being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the
Capital City and Harrisburg International Airports.
(2) It is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, morals
and general welfare that the creation or establishment of
obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented.
(3) The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to
the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power
without compensation.
C. It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or
establishment of hazards to air navigation, the elimination, removal,
alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation or marking and
lighting of obstructions are public purposes for which a political
subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or
interests in land.

§ 120-50. Establishment of zones.
In order to carry out the provisions of this article there are hereby created
and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath
the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical
surfaces as they apply to the Capital City Airport and the Harrisburg
International Airport. Such zones are shown on the Capital City Airport
and Harrisburg International Airport Height Limitation and Zoning District
Map prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of
Aviation, and dated Spring 1989, which is attached to this article and made
a part hereof.120 An area located in more than one of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
A. Utility Runway Visual Approach Surface Zone. The zone is established
beneath the visual approach surface. The inner edge of this zone
coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide.
The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center
line is the continuation of the center line of the runway.
B. Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Surface Zone. The
zone is established beneath the nonprecision instrument approach
surface. The inner edge of this zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet
from the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the
center line of the runway.
C. Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Surface Zone. The zone is
established beneath the visual approach surface. The inner edge of this
zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet
wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center
line is the continuation of the center line of the runway.
120. Editor's Note: Said map is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 120-49 § 120-50
120:676
D. Runway Larger Than Utility With a Visibility Minimum Greater Than 3/4
Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Surface Zone (Capital City
Airport). The zone is established beneath the nonprecision instrument
approach surface. The inner edge of this zone coincides with the width
of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet
from the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the
center line of the runway.
E. Runway Larger Than Utility With a Visibility Minimum As Low As 3/4
Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Surface Zone. The zone is
established beneath the nonprecision instrument approach surface. The
inner edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface
and is 1,000 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width
of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary
surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line of the
runway.
F. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Surface Zone (Harrisburg
International Airport). The zone is established beneath the precision
instrument approach surface. The inner edge of this zone coincides
with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The zone
expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal
distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center line is the
continuation of the center line of the runway.
G. Transitional Surface Zones. The zones are established beneath the
transitional surfaces adjacent to each runway and approach surface as
indicated on the Height Limitation and Zoning District Map.121
H. Horizontal Surface Zones. The zone is established beneath the
horizontal surface, 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the
perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet and
10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of
each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent
to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 5,000 feet for all runways
designated as utility or visual and 10,000 feet for all other runways. The
radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same
arithmetical value. That value will be the highest determined for either
end of the runway. When a five-thousand-foot are is encompassed by
tangents connecting two adjacent ten-thousand-foot arcs, the fivethousand-
foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the
perimeter of the horizontal surface. The Horizontal Surface Zone does
not include the Approach Surface and Transitional Surface Zones.
I. Conical Surface Zone. The zone is established beneath the conical
surface. This zone commences at the periphery of the horizontal surface
and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.

level.
(2) In addition to the foregoing, when an airport has a precision
instrument runway approach zone, there are established height
limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface and
extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the
Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone projects beyond the
Conical Zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the
same elevation as the approach surface and extending a horizontal
distance of 5,000 feet measured at ninety-degree angles to the
extended runway center line.

feet above the established airport elevation or at a height as follows:
(1) Capital City Airport: 697 feet above mean sea level.
(2) Harrisburg International Airport: 660 feet above mean sea level.
J. Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this article shall be construed
as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure or
growth of any tree to a height up to 75 feet above the surface of the
land.
A. Reasonableness. All airport zoning regulations adopted under this
article shall be reasonable; none shall impose any requirement or
restriction unless it is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of
this article. In determining what regulations it may adopt, each
municipality and joint Airport Zoning Board shall consider, among other
factors, the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted
at the airport, the nature of the terrain within the airport hazard area,
the character of the neighborhood and the uses to which the property to
be zoned is put and adaptable.
B. Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article,
no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this
article in such manner as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and

120:679
§ 120-53. Permits and variances.
aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair
visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or
otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
C. Nonconforming uses.
(1) Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or
other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming
to the regulations as of the effective date of this article or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use, except as
provided in § 120-53 (relating to permits and variances). Nothing
contained herein shall require any change in the construction,
alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this
article and which is diligently executed.
(2) Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this subsection, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure
or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and
maintenance thereon or nearby of such markers and lights as shall
be deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer to indicate to the
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of
such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the owner.
A. Future uses.
(1) Except as specifically provided in Subsection A(1)(a), (b) or (c)
hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established and no tree
shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit
therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application
for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined
whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use
inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted
unless a variance has been approved in accordance with this
§ 120-53D, except as follows:
(a) In the area lying within the limits of the Horizontal Zone and
Conical Zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
§ 120-52 § 120-53
120:680
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such zones.
(b) In areas lying within the limits of the Approach Zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of
the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limit prescribed for such Approach Zones.
(c) In the areas lying within the limits of the Transition Zones
beyond the perimeter of the Horizontal Zones, no permit shall
be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or
structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
feature, would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such Transition Zones.
(2) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or
alteration of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of
the height limits established by this article, except that no permit is
required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of
existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of
an existing structure.
B. Existing uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or rebuilt or tree allowed to grow higher or be
replanted, a permit must be secured from the municipality authorizing
the replacement or change. No permit shall be granted that would allow
the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a
nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date of this article or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is
made.
C. Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or
tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from this
article.
D. Variance.
(1) Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of
any structure or permit the growth of any object of natural growth
or otherwise use his property in violation of airport zoning
regulations may apply for a variance from the zoning regulations in
question pursuant to § 120-76D. A variance shall only be granted
after the requirements of § 120-76D are satisfied. A variance may
§ 120-53 ZONING § 120-53
120:681
§ 120-53.1. Zoning Hearing Board.
The Zoning Hearing Board shall, in addition to the other powers granted to
it pursuant to § 120-76, have and exercise the following powers:
be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public
interest but would do substantial justice and would be in
accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this article. Any
variance may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions that
the Zoning Hearing Board may deem necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this article. Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, if the Zoning Hearing Board decides to grant a permit or
variance under this article, it shall notify the Department of
Transportation of its decision. This notice shall be in writing and
shall be sent so as to reach the Department at least 10 days before
the date upon which the decision is to issue.
(2) The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the
effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Additionally, no
application for variance to the requirements of this article may be
considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the Airport Manager (or person
of equivalent description) for advice as to the aeronautical effects
of the variance. If the Airport Manager (or person of equivalent
description) does not respond to the application within 15 days
after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may act without such input
to grant or deny said application.
E. Hazard marking and lighting. In granting any permit or variance under
this section, the Board shall, if it deems the action advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this article and reasonable under the
circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to require the
owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit
the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person or persons
requesting the permit or variance to install, operate and maintain
thereon, at the owner's expense, such markers and lights as may be
required by guidelines or regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
F. Conflicts. In the event of conflict between any airport zoning
regulations adopted under this article and any other regulations
applicable to the same area, whether the conflict is with respect to the
height of structures or trees, and the use of land or any other matter
and whether the other regulations were adopted by the municipality
which adopted the airport zoning regulations or by some other
municipality or otherwise, the more stringent limitation or requirement
shall govern and prevail.
§ 120-53 § 120-53.1
120:682
§ 120-53.2. Acquisition of air rights.
In any case in which it is desired to remove, lower or otherwise terminate
a nonconforming structure or use or the approach protection necessary
cannot, because of constitutional limitations, be provided by airport zoning
regulations or it appears advisable that the necessary approach protection
be provided by acquisition of property rights rather than the airport zoning
regulations, the Borough or the municipality or municipal authority owning
the airport or served by it may acquire by purchase, grant or condemnation,
in the manner provided by the law under which municipalities are
authorized to acquire real property for public purposes, such air right,
aviation easement or other estate or interest in the property or
nonconforming structure or use in question as may be necessary to
effectuate the purpose of this article. In the case of the purchase of any
property or any easement or estate or interest therein or the acquisition
thereof by the power of eminent domain, the Borough or municipality or
municipal authority making the purchase or exercising the power shall, in
addition to the damages for the taking, injury or destruction of property,
also pay the cost of the removal and relocation of any structure or any
public utility which is required to be moved to a new location.

§ 120-69 ZONING § 120-73
120:703

terms, and shall not have the power to permit any construction or any use
or change of use which does not conform to this Zoning Chapter.
§ 120-74. Duties of Zoning Officer.
It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer, and he is hereby given the power
and authority, to enforce the provisions of this chapter. The Zoning Officer
shall examine all applications for permits, issue permits for construction
and uses which are in accordance with the requirements of this chapter,
record and file all applications for permits with accompanying plans and
documents and make such reports as the Borough Council may require.
Permits for construction and uses which are a special exception or a
variance to requirements of this chapter shall be issued only upon written
order of the Zoning Hearing Board.
§ 120-75. Appeals.
All appeals from decisions of the Zoning Officer shall be taken in the manner
set forth in Article X, Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247),
as amended.125
§ 120-76. Appointment of Zoning Hearing Board; powers and
duties.
The Borough Council shall appoint a Zoning Hearing Board, which shall
have the number of members and such powers and authority as set forth in
Article IX of Act 247 of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as enacted or
hereafter amended. The duly established Zoning Hearing Board shall have
the following functions:
A. Hearings. The Board shall conduct hearings and make decisions in
accordance with Section 908, Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code (Act 247), as amended.126 Notice shall be given to the public, the
applicant, the county planning agency, the Zoning Officer, such other
persons as the Borough Council shall designate by ordinance and any
person who has made timely request for the same. Notices shall be
given at such time and in such manner as prescribed by ordinance or, in
the absence of ordinance provision, by rules of the Board. The Borough
Council may establish reasonable fees based on cost, to be paid by the
applicant and persons requesting any notice not required by ordinance.
B. Appeals. The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
the appellant that the Zoning Officer has failed to follow prescribed
procedures or has misinterpreted or misapplied any provision of this
chapter or map or any valid rule or regulation governing the action of
125. Editor's Note: Said Article X was repealed in 1988 by P.L. 1329, No. 170. See now 53 P.S.
§ 11001-A et seq.
126. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10908.
§ 120-73 § 120-76
120:704
the Zoning Officer. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to deny
the appellant the right to proceed directly in court where appropriate.
C. Challenge to validity. Except as provided in Subsection D below,
relating to variances, the Board shall have no power to pass upon the
validity of any provision of any ordinance or map adopted by the
Borough Council. Recognizing that challenges to the validity of any
ordinance or map may present issues of fact and interpretation which
may lie within the special competence of the Board and to facilitate
speedy disposition of such challenges by a court, the Board may hear all
challenges wherein the validity of the ordinance or map presents any
issue of fact or interpretation not hitherto properly determined at a
hearing before another competent agency or body and shall take
evidence and make a record thereon as provided in Subsection A above.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall decide all contested
questions of interpretation and make findings on all relevant issues of
fact, which shall become part of the record on appeal to court.
D. Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant. The Board shall prescribe the form of
application and require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer.
The Board may grant a variance, provided the following findings are
made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Zoning
Chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Chapter, and the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship had not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance which will afford relief and represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue. In granting any
§ 120-76 ZONING § 120-76
120:705
variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this Zoning Chapter.
E. Special exceptions. In this chapter, special exceptions may be granted
or denied by the Board pursuant to expressed standards and criteria.
The Board shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in
accordance with such standards and criteria. In granting a special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. The Board
shall pursue the following procedure:
(1) The Board's decision to grant a permit for special exception use
shall be made only after public notice and hearing. Such permit
shall apply specifically to the application and plans submitted and
presented at said public hearing. Any subsequent amendments or
additions shall be subject to review and public hearing by the
Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception.
(2) No application for a permit shall be granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board for any special exception use until said Board has first
received and considered an advisory report thereon from the
Planning Commission with respect to the location to the needs and
growth pattern of the Borough of Steelton and, where appropriate,
with reference to the adequacy of the site area and the
arrangement of buildings, driveways, parking areas, off-street
truck loading spaces and other pertinent features of the site plan.
The Planning Commission shall have 30 days from the date of its
receipt of the application within which to file its report thereon. In
the event that said Commission shall fail to file its report within
such 30 days, such application shall be deemed to have been
approved by said Planning Commission. The Commission may have
representation at the public hearing held by the Zoning Hearing
Board on such application. After receipt of the report, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall hear the application in the same manner and
under the same procedure as it is empowered by law and ordinance
to hear cases and make exceptions to the provisions of this Zoning
Chapter. The Zoning Hearing Board may thereafter direct the
Zoning Officer to issue such permit if, in its judgment, any one of
such cases will not be detrimental to the health, safety and general
welfare of the Borough of Steelton and is deemed necessary for its
convenience.
(3) A special exception use for which a permit is granted by the Zoning
Hearing Board pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be
construed to be a conforming use.
F. Parties appellant before the Board. Appeals under Subsection B above,
and proceedings to challenge an ordinance under Subsection C above,
may be filed with the Board, in writing, by any officer or agency of the
§ 120-76 § 120-76
120:706
Borough of Steelton or any person aggrieved. Requests for variance
under Subsection D above, and special exception under Subsection E
above, may be filed with the Board by any landowner or any tenant with
the permission of such landowner.
(1) Time limitations. The time limitations for raising certain issues and
filing certain proceedings with the Board shall be the following:
(a) No issue of alleged defect in the process of enactment of any
ordinance or map or any amendment thereto shall be raised in
any proceeding filed with the Board later than 30 days from the
time such ordinance, map or amendment takes effect, unless
the person raising such issues alleges and proves that he failed
to receive adequate notice of the enactment or amendment. If
such person succeeded to his interest after the enactment of
the ordinances, adequate notice to his predecessor in interest
shall be deemed adequate notice to him.
(b) No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the
Board later than 30 days after any application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate
Borough officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed
to secure reversal or limit the approval in any manner, unless
such person alleges and proves that he failed to receive
adequate notice of such approval.
(c) If such person has succeeded to his interest after such
approval, adequate notice to his predecessor in interest shall
be deemed adequate notice to him.
(2) Stay of proceedings.
(a) Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in this section and
during its pendency before the Board, all development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the
Zoning Officer or any agency or body and all official action
thereunder shall be stayed, unless the Zoning Officer or any
other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case, the development or official action shall
not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Board or the court having jurisdiction of
zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or
other appropriate agency or body.
(b) When an application for development, preliminary or final, has
been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or
limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons other
than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post
bond as a condition of continuing the proceedings before the
Board. The question of whether or not such petition should be
§ 120-76 ZONING § 120-76

to commence work for the erection or alteration of any building or for a
change in land use until a permit has been duly issued therefor. No such
building permit or zoning permit shall be required in case of normal

families or dwelling units the building is designed to accommodate and
such information as may be necessary to determine compliance with
this chapter and all other ordinances. One copy of such plans shall be
returned to the owner when such plans shall be approved by the Zoning
Officer. All applications with accompanying plans and documents shall
become a public record after a permit is issued or denied.
C. Issuance of permits. No permit shall be issued until the Zoning Officer
has certified that the proposed building, addition or alteration complies
with all the provisions of this chapter, as well as with all the provisions
of an existing or hereafter enacted building code.127 A permit issued
hereunder shall become void 12 months after the issuance date.
D. Temporary permits. A temporary permit may be authorized by the
Zoning Hearing Board for a nonconforming structure or use which it
deems necessary to promote the proper development of the community,
provided that such nonconforming structure or use shall be completely
removed upon expiration of the permit without cost to the municipality.

expenses, as well as a collection procedure for building permits,
certificates of occupancy, appeals, variances, amendments, bonds and
other matters pertaining to this chapter. The schedule of fees shall be

which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the filth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the District Justice, and thereafter, each day that a

§ A131-35. Creation of eligibility list. [Amended 10-16-2000 by Res.
No. R-2000-2, approved 10-16-2000]
At the completion of the examination requirements set forth in Article
IV, written examination, oral examination, background investigation and
physical fitness test, the Commission shall rank all passing applicants on
a list, with the applicant receiving the highest score at the top of the list
and the applicant receiving the lowest passing score at the bottom of the
list. Applicants who qualify for veterans' preference points shall have those
points added to their passing score prior to being ranked on the eligibility
list. For promotional positions, fulfilling the performance requirement set
forth in § A131-21 is also required. In the case of tied scores, the tie will
be broken by giving preference (listing higher on the list) to the applicant
who submitted a final completed application first. If both tied applicants
submitted their complete applications on the same day, then the applicants
shall be ranked in alphabetical order by surname. The Commission may, at
its sole discretion, void an eligibility list at any time for any reason, but in
no case shall any eligible list remain in effect for a period of more than two
years from the date of its preparation.
§ A131-36. Filling of vacancies; removal of names from eligible list.
A. The appointing authority of the Borough may fill any vacancy in an
existing position in the Police Department which occurs as a result of
expansion of the police force, retirement, resignation, disability or
death by the reappointment or reinstatement of a former employee of
the Police Department who had been furloughed. Except for physical
and psychological examinations, no other testing shall be required for a
furloughed employee.
B. If no furlough list exists or if positions remain to be filled after all of the
officers on the furlough list were offered reemployment, for every
position except that of the Chief of Police the Commission shall certify
names from the eligible list. The number of available eligibles certified
from the eligible list shall exceed by two the number of vacancies to be
filled from such eligible list. If there are fewer than three available
eligibles on the eligible list, the Borough Council may nominate a
person to the Commission for noncompetitive examination, and he may
be appointed provisionally to fill such vacancy. It shall thereupon
become the duty of the Commission within three weeks to hold a
competitive examination and certify a list of eligible, and a regular
appointment shall then be made from the name or names submitted by
the Commission; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall
prevent the appointment without examination of persons temporarily as
police officers in cases of riot or other emergency.
C. Removal of names from list.
§ A131-35 CIVIL SERVICE RULES § A131-36
A131:731
§ A131-37. Appointment of Chief of Police.
(1) In addition to the other reasons stated as grounds for removal in
these rules and regulations, the name of any person appearing on a
furlough list or an eligible list shall be removed by the Commission
if such person:
(a) Is appointed to a position in the Police Department;
(b) Declines an appointment to a permanent position in the Police
Department;
(c) Fails to make written reply to the Borough Council within
seven calendar days from the date of mailing of a notice of
certification; or
(d) Indicates availability for appointment and is appointed to fill a
vacancy but fails to report for duty at the time prescribed,
unless, in the opinion of the Borough Council, such person can
show good and sufficient reasons for failure to report.
(2) The name of any person on an eligible list also shall be removed by
the Commission if certified for appointment consideration three
times as the top name and is not appointed. Nothing in this section,
however, shall be construed as authorizing the removal of the name
of a person from a furlough list or eligible list who refuses or
accepts a position of a lower rank than that from which furloughed
or for which eligible on a Commission list.
D. The Commission shall certify for each existing vacancy from the eligible
list the names of three persons thereon who have received the highest
average. The Borough Council shall, thereupon, with sole reference to
the merits and fitness of the candidates and in accordance with
applicable laws, make an appointment from the three names certified
unless it makes objections to the Commission as to one or more persons
certified for any of the reasons set forth in § A131-23 of these rules and
regulations. Should such objections be sustained by the Commission,
the Commission shall thereupon strike the name of such person from
the eligible list and certify the next highest name for each name
stricken off. In the event a "soldier," as that term is defined under the
Veterans Preference Act, is on the eligibility list, either for initial
appointment or promotion, the soldier shall be appointed or promoted,
if the Council determines to fill the vacancy; if two or more soldiers
