of the Lancaster County Chiefs of Police Association.
4. Written Examinations. The written examination shall be graded on a
one-hundred-point scale, and an applicant must score 70% or higher in
order to continue in the application process. Applicants scoring less
than 70% shall be rejected by the Commission or its designee. Within
45 days after the administration of the written examination, all
applicants shall be given written notice of their test results, and passing
applicants shall be scheduled for an oral examination appointment. If
the written test is administered by the Lancaster County Chiefs of
Police Association through its joint hiring process, then the top 12
applicants shall be scheduled for an oral examination appointment with
the Commission or its designee. If the Commission determines that
additional oral examinations beyond the top 12 applicants are required,
it will schedule them.
5. Oral Examinations. If the Commission administers the written test, then
every applicant who scored 70% or higher in the written examination
shall be given an oral examination, which will be graded on a 100-point
scale, with a score of 70% or higher necessary for passing.
Alternatively, if the written test is administered by the Lancaster
County Chiefs of Police Association through its joint hiring process,
then the top 12 applicants shall be scheduled for an oral examination
appointment with the Commission or its designee. If the Commission
determines that additional oral examinations beyond the top 12
applicants are required, it will schedule them. The oral examination
shall involve questioning applicants on how they would handle
situations relevant to police work. Within 45 days after the applicants'
oral examination, they shall be informed of the score in their oral
examination and total overall score, and each passing applicant shall be
informed of the date for the content-based task test. If the applicant has
been part of the Lancaster County Chiefs of Police Association joint
hiring process, then the physical fitness or agility examination will have
been completed prior to the oral examination. [Amended by Ord. No.
992, 5/16/2019]
6. Veterans' Preference Points. Pursuant to the Veterans' Preference Act,
any applicant for the position of police officer who qualifies as a soldier
under this Act shall receive an additional 10 points on top of his/her
total score if that applicant had received passing scores under
Subsections 1, 4 and 5, above. Veterans' preference points do not apply
to promotional examinations.

8. Background Investigation.
A. The Commission shall request the Chief of Police or the Chief's
designee to conduct a background investigation on the top
applicants for the open position. If more than one police officer
position is being offered, background checks will be performed on
the quantity of candidates as decided on and directed by the
Commission. If the Commission determines that additional
background investigations beyond the top applicants are required,
it will schedule them. The background investigation shall include
interviews with the candidate's family, acquaintances, current and
former employers, current and former neighbors, references and
current and former teachers and school officials. In addition, the
candidate's credit history and record of criminal convictions should
be investigated, and the candidate will be administered a
polygraph examination by a certified polygraphist. The candidate
may be interviewed directly when the information collected during
the background investigation requires clarification or explanation.
B. After the background investigation is completed, the Chief or his/
her designee shall make a written recommendation to the
Commission on whether the candidate is appropriate for
consideration for appointment as a police officer.
C. Appropriateness of the candidate shall be based on the criteria set
forth in § 313, Subsection 7, of these rules and regulations. This
recommendation shall be in writing; and if the recommendation is
to disqualify, then a detailed written explanation of the reasons for
disqualification must be included. The Commission shall make the
final determination on whether the information collected during
the background investigation warrants rejection of the candidate.
1. Within 60 days after the Commission considers the recommendation of
the Chief of Police or his/her designee, each candidate will be informed
of whether he/she has passed the background investigation.
A. Creation of Eligibility List.
(1) At the completion of the examination requirements set forth in
§ 314, written examination, oral examination and background
investigation, the Commission shall rank all passing candidates
on a list, with the candidate receiving the highest score at the
§ 314 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 315
FWD:26
top of the list and the candidate receiving the lowest passing
score at the bottom of the list. Candidates who qualify for
veterans preference points shall have those points added to
his/her passing score prior to being ranked on the eligibility
list but after the completion of the examination requirements,
set forth in § 314, written examination, oral examination (but
before the background investigation). For promotional
positions, fulfilling the performance requirement set forth in
§ 313, Subsection G, is also required. In the case of tied scores,
the tie will be broken by giving preference to the candidate
who submitted a final completed application first. If both tied
candidates submitted his/her complete applications on the
same day, then the candidates shall be ranked in alphabetical
order by surname.
(2) The eligibility list should be valid for one year from the date the
Commission ranks all passing candidates, assigns veterans'
preference points and formally adopts the eligibility list. The
Commission may, at its sole discretion, by a vote of the majority
of the Commission at a duly authorized Commission meeting,
extend the list for an additional year. The Commission may, at
its sole discretion, void an eligibility list at any time for any
reason.
2. Appointment.
A. If no furlough list exists or if positions remain to be filled after all of
the officers on the furlough list were offered re-employment, every
position, except that of Chief of Police, shall be filled only in the
following manner:
(1) The Borough Council shall notify the Commission of any
vacancy which is to be filled and shall request the certification
of three names from the list of eligibles.
(2) If three names are not available, then the Commission may
certify the name(s) remaining on the list.
(3) The Borough Council shall make an appointment from one of
the three names certified, with sole reference to the merits and
fitness of the candidates. However (for initial appointment to
the position of police officer), when one of the three candidates
on the certified list is a veteran, that candidate shall be
selected.
B. The Borough Council may fill any vacancy in an existing position in
the Police Department which occurs as a result of retirement,
resignation, disability or death by the reappointment or
reinstatement of a former employee of the Police Department who
had been furloughed. Except for physical and psychological
examinations, no other testing shall be required for a furloughed
employee or a rehired or reappointed employee.
§ 315 FOREWORD § 315
FWD:27
C. The Borough Council may object to one or more of the persons
certified for the reasons set forth in § 313, Subsection 7, of these
rules and regulations. If the candidate to whom the Borough
Council objects fails to timely exercise the rights of appeal under
§ 313, Subsection 9, or if the Commission declines to uphold the
appeal, the Commission shall strike the name of that candidate
from the eligibility list and certify the next-highest name of
inclusion on the list of three candidates for each name stricken off.
3. Appointment of Chief of Police. In the case of a vacancy in the office of
Chief of Police or equivalent official, the appointing authority has full
discretion in selecting the individual to fill such position. If the
appointing authority requests the Commission to subject that person to
a noncompetitive examination, and if that person successfully passes
the noncompetitive examination, then the Commission shall notify the
appointing authority of the results of the examination and that person
may only be removed from the position of Chief of Police for the reasons
set forth in § 316, Subsection L.
4. Physical and Psychological Examinations. After the Borough Council
selects a candidate from the certified list of three for appointment to
the vacant position, such candidate shall be offered the position;
however, that offer shall be conditional and subject to a physical
examination and a psychological examination by the appropriate
medical expert consistent with the requirements of Section 461189 of
the Borough Code,4 which are incorporated by reference as if fully set
forth herein. If the candidate successfully passes the physical and
psychological examinations, then that employee shall be appointed to
the vacant position in the Police Department for which the application
was submitted. Failure to pass either examination shall result in the
candidate being rejected for appointment. The rejected candidate may
appeal this decision under § 313, Subsection 9. [Amended by Ord. No.
992, 5/16/2019]
5. Probationary Period.
A. Every successful candidate to the position of police officer or to a
promotional position with the Police Department shall serve a
twelve-month probationary period (for newly hired police officers,
the one-year probationary period shall not commence until after
the officer has completed training under 53 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2161 to
2164).
B. During the probationary period, a newly hired officer may only be
dismissed for the reasons set forth in § 313, Subsection 7. A
promoted officer, during probation, may be returned to a prior rank
only for cause for the reasons set forth in § 313, Subsection 7.
4. Editor's Note: See 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 1189.

FWD:28
§ 316. Suspensions, Removals and Reductions in Rank. [Ord. 899,
11/20/2008]
C. However, at the end of the twelve-month probationary period, if the
conduct of the probationer has not been satisfactory to the Borough
Council, the probationer shall be notified, in writing, that the
appointment will not be permanent. At that time, a newly hired
officer's employment shall end, and a promoted officer shall return
to a previous rank. Any officer who is not informed in writing that
his/her performance has been unsatisfactory prior to the end of his
probationary period shall receive a permanent appointment to the
new position. Any probationer who is notified in writing that his
appointment will not be made permanent has no right of appeal
under these rules.
1. Grounds for Disciplinary Action.
A. No person appointed to a position in the Police Department
pursuant to these rules and regulations may be suspended without
pay or removed, and no person promoted in rank pursuant to these
rules and regulations may be reduced in rank, except for the
following reasons:
(1) Physical or mental disability affecting the officer's ability to
continue in service, in which case the officer shall receive an
honorable discharge from service.
(2) Neglect or violation of any official duty.
(3) Violation of any law which provides that such violation
constitutes a misdemeanor or felony.
(4) Inefficiency, neglect, intemperance, immorality, disobedience
of orders or conduct unbecoming an officer.
(5) Intoxication while on duty.
(6) Engaging or participating in the conduct of a political or
election campaign while on duty or in uniform or while using
Borough property otherwise than to exercise the person's own
right of suffrage. [Amended by Ord. No. 992, 5/16/2019]
(7) Engaging or participating in the conduct of a political or
election campaign for an incompatible office as provided in
Section 1104(f)5 (relating to appointments and incompatible
offices). [Added by Ord. No. 992, 5/16/2019]
B. No officer shall be removed for religious, racial or political reasons.
A statement of any charges made against any officer so employed
5. Editor's Note: See 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 1104(f).
§ 315 FOREWORD § 316
FWD:29
shall be furnished to the officer within five days after those charges
have been adopted by the Borough Council.
2. Furloughs.
A. If, for reasons of economy or other reasons, it shall be deemed
necessary by the Borough to reduce the number of full-time police
officers in the Department, then the Borough shall apply the
following procedure:
(1) If the number of full-time police officers eligible for retirement
is insufficient to effect the necessary reductions in numbers, or
if there are no persons eligible for retirement, or if no
retirement or pension fund exists, then the reductions shall be
effected by furloughing the person or persons, including
probationers, last appointed to the respective force.
B. Such removal shall be accomplished by furloughing in numerical
order commencing with the person last appointed until such
reduction shall have been accomplished. In the event that the
appointing authority decides to increase the Police Department, the
furloughed officers shall be reinstated in order of their seniority in
the Department if the furloughed officer accepts reinstatement in
writing within 30 days of receiving notice of the opening. These
reductions-in-force provisions are not applicable to the Chief of
Police.
3. Notice of Suspension, Removal or Reduction in Rank.
A. Whenever a police officer is suspended, removed or reduced in
rank, the specific charges warranting such actions shall be stated
in writing by the Borough Council. The charges shall be stated
clearly and in sufficient detail to enable the officer to understand
the charges and to allow the officer an opportunity to respond to
those charges. The charges shall specify the subsection of
Subsection 1, above which provides the basis for the disciplinary
action as well as an explanation of the factual circumstances upon
which the appointing authority relied in finding a violation of
Subsection 1, above.
B. Within five days after the Borough Council has voted to impose the
disciplinary action, a written statement of the charges shall be
delivered to the officer, either by personal service or by certified
and registered mail. In addition, the charges shall notify the officer
of the right to appeal under Subsection, 4, below of these rules and
regulations. A copy of the statement of charges shall also be served
upon the members of the Civil Service Commission.
4. Hearings on Suspensions, Removals and Reductions in Rank.
A. The officer who has been suspended, removed or reduced in rank
may appeal the decision of the Borough Council by written notice to
§ 316 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 316
FWD:30
the Secretary of the Commission at 600 S. Hanover Street,
Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, 17022, requesting a hearing. This
request shall be received by the Commission within 10 days after
the officer received notice of the discipline. The officer may make
written answers to any charges filed not later than the date fixed
for the hearing. Failure of the officer to provide written answers to
any of the charges shall not be deemed an admission by the officer.
B. The Commission shall schedule a hearing within 10 days from the
officer's written request for a hearing, unless continued by the
Commission for cause at the request of the Commission, the
Borough Council, or the officer. At any such hearing, the officer
against whom the charges have been made may be present and
maybe represented by counsel and may call witnesses and present
testimony and documentation in defense. The Borough may also be
represented by counsel, call witnesses and present evidence as is
necessary to support the charges. A stenographic record of all
testimony shall be taken at every hearing and preserved by the
Commission. In the event the charges are dismissed, the record
shall be sealed and shall not be available for public inspection.
C. In conducting the hearing, the Commission's standard of review
shall be to determine whether sufficient evidence has been
presented to support the statutory reason for the disciplinary
action. If the Commission finds that sufficient evidence has been
introduced to support the charge, the Commission shall not modify
the penalty imposed by the Borough Council unless it finds that the
penalty imposed was arbitrary, discriminatory or an abuse of the
Council's discretion. In considering the appropriateness of the
discipline, the Commission shall not substitute its judgment for that
of the Borough Council. The Commission may request posthearing
briefs and shall issue a written decision containing specific findings
of fact and conclusions of law within 60 days of receipt of the
hearing transcript and any briefs.
5. Hearing Procedure.
A. All testimony shall be given under oath administered by the
Chairperson or in the absence of the Chair, the Vice Chairperson.
The Commission shall have the power to issue subpoenas as set
forth in § 312, Subsection 11. The hearing shall be open to the
public unless, prior to the commencement of the hearing, a written
or oral request to close the hearing is made by either the charged
officer or the Borough. A stenographic record of all testimony taken
at said hearings shall be filed with and preserved by the
Commission, which record shall be sealed and not be available for
public inspection in the event the charges are dismissed.
B. If the Commission sustains the charges, the officer who was
suspended, removed or reduced in rank may file an appeal with the
Court of Common Pleas within 30 days from the date of entry by the
§ 316 FOREWORD § 316
FWD:31
Commission of its final order. No order of suspension shall be made
by the Commission for a period longer than one year. In the event
that the Commission fails to uphold the charges, then the person
sought to be suspended, removed or demoted shall be reinstated
with full pay for the period of the suspension, removal or demotion,
and no charges related to the suspension, removal or reduction in
rank shall be officially recorded in the officer's record.6

therewith and specify repairs, if any. It shall be served on the owner of

days after service of such order apply to a court of record for an order
restraining the Code Official from razing and removing such structure
or parts thereof. The court shall determine whether the order of the
Code Official is reasonable, and if found reasonable, the court shall
dissolve the restraining order, and if found not reasonable, the court
shall continue the restraining order or modify it as the circumstances
may require.
5. Failure to Comply. Whenever the owner of a property fails to comply
with a demolition order within the time prescribed, the Code Official

removal, shall be promptly remitted with a report of such sale or

not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and
ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall
revoke the permit and report such fact to the Borough Council for
whatever action it considers necessary.
7. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain in perpetuity all records
associated with the requirements of this chapter, including, but not
limited to, finished construction elevation data, permitting, inspection
and enforcement.
8. The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for submitting a
biennial report to FEMA concerning community participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program.
9. The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments
of the Floodplain Administrator can be delegated from the person
identified. However, the ultimate responsibility lies with the person
identified in the Floodplain Ordinance as the Floodplain Administrator/
Manager.
10. The Floodplain Administrator shall consider the requirements of the 34
Pa. Code and the 2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC or the latest edition

ENFORCEMENT OF HEALTH LAWS
§ 101. Abolition of the Board of Health and Position of Health
Officer; Future Enforcement of Health Laws. [Ord. 829, 11/15/2001,
as amended by Ord. 914, 1/21/2010]
1. Findings. The Borough Council, after due deliberation and discussion,
has determined that it is no longer economically feasible to continue in
existence the Elizabethtown Board of Health and the position of Health
Officer most recently created by Ordinance 829 on November 15, 2001.
The Borough Council has determined that the functions of the Board of
Health and Health Officer may be undertaken by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania through the Pennsylvania State Department of Health. As
such, specific expenditures related to a Board of Health and Health
Officer have been found to be unnecessary at this time. Further, the
Borough Council notes that 53 P.S. § 48110 of the Borough Code
provides "any Borough may cooperate with the county or counties in
which it is located, or with any city, borough or township as well as with
the State Department of Health in the administration and enforcement
of health laws."
2. Abolishment of Elizabethtown Board of Health and Health Officer
Position. Based upon the foregoing findings, it is herewith resolved that
immediately upon the effective date of this Part the Board of Health of
the Borough of Elizabethtown and the position of Health Officer are
abolished and each and every of its members and Health Officer are
discharged and relieved of any further duty or responsibility.
3. Future Enforcement of Health Laws, Ordinances, Rules and
Regulations. The Borough Council herewith resolves that the Borough
staff shall forthwith contact appropriate persons at the State
Department of Health of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in order to
coordinate the taking over of all functions previously engaged in by the
Board of Health of the Borough of Elizabethtown and its Health Officer
as soon as is reasonably practical.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 101. Short Title. [Ord. 954, 12/19/2013]
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of
Elizabethtown Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 102. Statement of Findings. [Ord. 954, 12/19/2013]
Elizabethtown Borough Council finds that:
§ 103. Purpose. [Ord. 954, 12/19/2013]
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare by
minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in § 102 of this
chapter through provisions designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood-control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety and increases non-point-source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of SWM, including reasonable regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental
to the public health, safety, welfare and the protection of the people of
the Borough of Elizabethtown and all the people of the commonwealth,
their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) under the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
E. Riparian forest buffers enhance water quality by filtering pollutants in
runoff, providing light control and temperature moderation, processing
pollutants, increasing infiltration and providing channel and shoreline
stability, thus decreasing erosion.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim
§ 101 FOREWORD § 103
FWD:293
§ 104. Statutory Authority. [Ord. 954, 12/19/2013]
and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as practicable.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and stream beds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater
management best management practices (SWM BMPs) that are
implemented within the Borough of Elizabethtown.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
I. Promote stormwater runoff prevention through the use of nonstructural
best management practices (BMPs).
J. Provide a regulatory environment that supports the proportion, density
and intensity of development called for in the Comprehensive Plan;
allow for creative methods of improving water quality and managing
stormwater runoff; and promote a regional approach to water resource
management.
K. Help preserve and protect exceptional natural resources and conserve
and restore natural resource systems.
L. Promote stormwater management practices that emphasize infiltration,
evaporation and transpiration.

"I, ___________________, certify that the proposed stormwater/BMP
facility (circle one) is/is not underlain by carbonate geology."
E. Whenever an SWM facility will be located in an area underlain by
carbonate geology, a geological evaluation of the proposed location
by a registered professional geologist shall be conducted to
determine susceptibility to sinkhole formation. The evaluation may
include the use of impermeable liners to reduce or eliminate the
separation distances listed in Subsection 10A and B.
11. Infiltration BMPs shall be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this chapter. Infiltration BMPs
shall include pretreatment BMPs unless shown to be unnecessary.
12. Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall
be selected based on suitability of soils and development site conditions
and shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:

forestry/plants/invasiveplants/index.htm.
C. The limit of existing, native vegetation to remain shall be
delineated on the plan along with proposed construction protection
measures.
D. Prior to construction, a tree protection zone shall be delineated at
the dripline of the tree canopy. All trees scheduled to remain during
construction shall be marked; however, where groups of trees exist,
only the tress on the outside edge need to be effectively marked to
promote protection of the trees during construction. No
construction, storage of material, temporary parking, pollution of
soil, or regrading shall occur within the tree protection zone.
E. All planting shall be performed in conformance with good nursery
and landscape practice. Plant materials shall conform to the

maintenance note for the stake and/or wire removal within one
year of planting.
15. Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase to
maintain maximum infiltration capacity, including but not limited to
fencing to limit construction traffic over the infiltration area. Staging of
earthmoving activities and selection of construction equipment should
consider this protection.
§ 301 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 301
FWD:314
§ 302. Volume Controls. [Ord. 954, 12/19/2013]
Volume control BMPs are intended to maintain existing hydrologic
conditions for small storm events by promoting groundwater recharge and/
or evapotranspiration as described in this section. Runoff volume controls
shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method described in
16. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff from
disturbed areas until the entire contributory drainage area to the
infiltration BMP has achieved final stabilization.
17. A minimum twenty-foot-wide access easement shall be provided for all
SWM facilities with tributary areas equal to or greater than 1,000
square feet and not located within a public right-of-way. Easements
shall provide for ingress and egress to a public right-of-way. This shall
be noted on the plan.
18. Drainage easements shall be provided where the conveyance,
treatment or storage of stormwater, either existing or proposed, is
identified on the SWM site plan. Drainage easements shall be provided
to contain and convey the one-hundred-year frequency flood.
19. The Borough may require additional stormwater control measures for
stormwater discharges to special management areas, including, but not
limited to:
A. Water bodies listed as "impaired" on Pennsylvania's Clean Water
Act 303(d)/305(b) Integrated List.
B. Any water body or watershed with an approved total maximum
daily load (TMDL).
C. Critical areas with sensitive resources (e.g., state-designated
special protection waters, cold-water fisheries, carbonate or other
groundwater recharge areas highly vulnerable to contamination,
drainage areas to water supply reservoirs, source water protection
zones, etc.).
20. Roof drains and sump pumps shall be tributary to surface infiltration or
vegetative BMPs. Use of catchment facilities for the purpose of reuse is
also permitted. When it is more advantageous to connect directly to
streets or storm sewers, roof drain connections to streets or roadside
ditches may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Borough. It
shall be the burden of the person seeking to make the connection to
demonstrate to the Borough that such connection is more advantageous
and such connection shall not violate any state or federal statute, rule
or regulation. Proposed storm sewer piping may connect to an existing
storm sewer piping system, provided the existing storm sewer is
adequate.
21. Nonstructural BMPs shall be utilized for all regulated activities unless
proven to be impractical.
§ 301 FOREWORD § 302
FWD:315
Subsection A below, or through continuous modeling approaches or other
means as described in the BMP Manual. Small projects may use the method
described in Subsection B to design volume control BMPs.
A. The Design Storm Method is applicable to any size of regulated activity.
This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour storm
event.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment), nonforested, pervious areas must
be considered meadow in good condition.
(b) When the existing project site contains impervious area, 20%
of existing impervious area to be disturbed shall be considered
meadow in good condition in the model for existing conditions.
(c) The maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in
karst areas shall be 3:1 impervious drainage area to infiltration
area and 5:1 total drainage area to infiltration area. The
maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in nonkarst
areas shall be 5:1 impervious drainage area to infiltration area
and 8:1 total drainage area to infiltration area. A higher ratio
may be approved by the Borough if justification is provided.
Hydraulic depth may be used as an alternative to an areabased
loading ratio if the design hydraulic depth is shown to be
less than the depth that could result from the maximum area
loading ratio.
B. Volume Control for Small Projects. At least the first one inch of runoff
from new impervious surfaces or an equivalent volume shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released
into the surface waters of this commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration and infiltration.
C. A detailed geologic evaluation of the development site shall be
performed in areas of carbonate geology to determine the design
parameters of recharge facilities. A report shall be prepared in
accordance with Section 504 of this chapter.
D. Storage facilities, including normally dry, open-top facilities, shall
completely drain the volume control storage over a period of time not
less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the
design storm. Any designed infiltration at such facilities is exempt from
the minimum twenty-four-hour standard, i.e., may infiltrate in a shorter
period of time based on a field-tested infiltration rate, provided that
none of this water will be discharged into waters of this commonwealth.
§ 302 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 302
FWD:316
§ 303. Rate Controls. [Ord. 954, 12/19/2013]
Rate control for large storms, up to the one-hundred-year event, is essential
to protect against immediate downstream erosion and flooding.
E. Any portion of the volume control storage that meets all of the following
criteria may also be used as rate control storage:
(1) Volume control storage that depends on infiltration is designed
according to the infiltration standards in § 301.
(2) The volume control storage which will be used for rate control is
that storage which is available within 24 hours from the end of the
design storm based on the stabilized infiltration rate and/or the
evapotranspiration rate.
F. Volume control storage facilities designed to infiltrate shall avoid the
least-permeable hydrologic soil group(s) at the development site.
A. Match Predevelopment Hydrograph. Applicants shall provide
infiltration facilities or utilize other techniques which will allow the
post-development one-hundred-year hydrograph to match the
predevelopment one-hundred-year hydrograph for the development
site. To match the predevelopment hydrograph, the post-development
peak rate must be less than or equal to the predevelopment peak rate,
and the post-development runoff volume must be less than or equal to
the predevelopment volume for the same storm event.
B. Where the predevelopment hydrograph cannot be matched, the postdevelopment
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates for the two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundredyear,
twenty-four-hour storm events.* If it is shown that the peak rates
of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or
equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the predevelopment
analysis for two-, ten-, twenty-five, fifty- and one-hundred-year, twentyfour-
hour storms,* then the requirements of this section have been met.
Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary
to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
* A twenty-four-hour SCS Type II storm or an IDF Curve Rational
Method storm. (See Table 3-1 in § 305.)
C. Normally dry, open-top, storage facilities shall completely drain the rate
control storage over a period of time less than or equal to 24 hours from
the peak one-hundred-year water surface design elevation.
D. A variety of BMPs should be employed and tailored to suit the
development site. The following is a partial listing of BMPs which can
be utilized in SWM systems for rate control where appropriate:
(1) Decreased impervious surface coverage.
(2) Routed flow over grass.
§ 302 FOREWORD § 303
FWD:317

(9) Cisterns and underground reservoirs.
(10) Amended soils.
(11) Retention basins.
(12) Detention basins.
(13) Other methods as may be found in the BMP Manual.
E. Small projects are not required to provide for rate control.
1. Runoff from impervious areas shall be drained to pervious areas within
the development site, unless the site has 85% or more impervious cover
and is a redevelopment,10 in which case the portion of the site that
discharges to pervious areas shall be maximized.
2. Stormwater runoff from a development site to an adjacent property
shall flow directly into a natural drainageway, watercourse or into an
existing storm sewer system or onto adjacent properties in a manner
similar to the runoff characteristics of the predevelopment flow.
3. Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated or otherwise altered without evidence
of a written certified letter of notification to the adjacent property
owner(s) by the developer. Such stormwater flows shall be subject to
the requirements of this chapter, including the establishment of a
drainage easement. Copies of all such notifications shall be included in
land disturbance plan submission.
4. Existing on-site natural and man-made SWM facilities shall be used to
the maximum extent practicable.
5. Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one subwatershed to
another unless they are subwatersheds of a common watershed that
join together within the perimeter of the development site and the
effect of the transfer does not alter the peak discharge onto adjacent
lands.
§ 303 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 304
FWD:318
§ 305. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. 954, 12/19/2013]
6. Minimum floor elevations for all structures that would be affected by a
basin, other temporary impoundments, or open conveyance systems
where ponding may occur shall be two feet above the one-hundred-year
water surface elevation. If basement or underground facilities are
proposed, detailed calculations addressing the effects of stormwater
ponding on the structure and waterproofing and/or floodproofing
design information shall be submitted for approval.
7. All stormwater-conveyance facilities (excluding detention, retention,
and wetland basin outfall structures) shall be designed to convey a
twenty-five-year storm event.* All stormwater-conveyance facilities
(excluding detention, retention, and wetland basin outfall structures)
conveying water originating from off site shall be designed to convey a
fifty-year storm event.* The SWM report shall also provide calculations
verifying the safe conveyance of the one-hundred-year runoff event* to
appropriate peak rate control BMPs must be demonstrated in the
design.
* A twenty-four-hour SCS Type II storm or an IDF Curve Rational
Method storm.
8. Erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels and at all
points of discharge. Flow velocities from any storm sewer may not
result in erosion of the receiving channel.
1. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater
than 200 acres and time of concentration (Tc) greater than 60 minutes,
including on- and off-site areas, shall use generally accepted calculation
techniques based on the NRCS Soil-Cover-Complex Method.
2. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Modified Rational Method, a Soil-Cover-Complex
Methodology, or other method acceptable to the Borough. Table 3-1
summarizes acceptable computation methods. It is assumed that all
methods will be selected by the design professional based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
development site.

information for the five- through sixty-minute duration storm events.
(Refer to Appendix B-3).31
5. Hydrographs may be obtained from NRCS methods such as TR-55,
TR20 or from use of the "modified" or "unit hydrograph" rational
methods. If "modified" or "unit hydrograph" rational methods are used,
the ascending leg of the hydrograph shall have a length equal to three

have a length equal to seven times the time of concentration (7 x Tc) to
approximate an SCS Type II hydrograph.11
6. Runoff calculations shall include a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
indicating volume and velocities of flow and the grades, sizes and
capacities of water-carrying structures, sediment basins, retention and
detention structures and sufficient design information to construct such
facilities. Runoff calculations shall also indicate both predevelopment
and post-development rates for peak discharge of stormwater runoff
from all discharge points.
7. For the purpose of calculating predevelopment peak discharges, all
runoff coefficients, both on-site and off-site, shall be based on actual
land use assuming summer or good land conditions. Post-development
runoff coefficients for off-site discharges used to design conveyance
facilities shall be based on actual land use assuming winter or poor land

(3) Open Channel Flow: At points where sheet and shallow
concentrated flows concentrate in field depressions, swales,
gutters, curbs or pipe collection systems, the travel times to
the downstream end of the development site between these
design points shall be based upon Manning's Equation and/or
acceptable engineering design standards as determined by the
Borough Engineer.
C. The developer may use stormwater credits for nonstructural BMPs
in accordance with the BMP Manual. The allowable reduction will
be determined by the Borough.
D. Peak rate control is not required for off-site runoff. Off-site runoff
may be bypassed around the site, provided all other discharge
requirements are met. If off-site runoff is routed through rate
control facilities, runoff coefficients for off-site discharges used to
design those rate control facilities shall be based on actual land use
assuming winter or poor land conditions.
9. Times of concentration shall be calculated based on the methodology
recommended in the respective model used. Tc for channel and pipe
flow shall be computed using Manning's Equation. Supporting
documentation and calculations must be submitted for review and
approval.
1. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian corridor
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian corridor.
2. Except as otherwise required by Chapter 102, the riparian corridor

There is hereby imposed upon all owners of property located within the
Borough of Elizabethtown which are connected to and have use of Borough
sewers, sewerage system and sewage treatment plant, hereinafter
collectively called "sewer system," an annual sewer rental, effective April
1, 1978, and thereafter, and which shall be due and payable quarterly in
accordance with the schedule of rates and classifications hereinafter set
forth:
A. Private Dwellings or Living Units. [Amended by Ord. 965, 12/18/

photofinishers, swimming pools, hospitals, retail stores, beauty
salons, barber shops, funeral homes, financial institutions, office
buildings, theaters, municipal buildings, dry cleaners, coinoperated
car washes and bakeries, shall be based on the volume or
quantity of water used as evidenced by meter readings of water
meters installed by the water supplier for the purpose of measuring
water purchased from such water supplier or such other meters or
measuring devices as may be installed or otherwise determined
pursuant to the provisions of this Part, and shall be subject to the
minimum charges hereinafter provided, all as follows: [Amended
by Ord. 965, 12/18/2014; and by Ord. 971, 12/17/2015]
(a) Quarterly Rate  $0.0081 per gallon.

The quarterly sewer rate or charges for all industrial
establishments and nonresidential users who have purchased
§ 201 FOREWORD § 201
FWD:379
reserved capacity in the treatment works shall be the proportion
of the total cost to the Borough of operating the wastewater
treatment plant (including applicable administrative costs but
excluding debt service cost) equal to the ratio of the user's total
recorded flow of wastewater to the total recorded flow of all
industrialized and sanitary wastewater from all sources discharged
into the facility. The charge shall be calculated in accordance with
the following formula:
The charge shall be determined by multiplying the total operation
and maintenance cost of the treatment works (excluding the
Borough's debt service) by the ratio of the user's total recorded
flow of wastewater to the total recorded flow of all industrial
and sanitary wastewater from all Borough customers through the
treatment works.
A = B x C/D
Where:
A = user's basic operation and maintenance charge
B = total operation and maintenance cost of the
treatment works exclusive of all principal or interest
payable by the Borough because, on account of, or by
reason of any outstanding obligation of the Borough

treatment works
(3) Surcharge. In addition, a surcharge shall be imposed for any
industrial waste which the Borough consents to accept into the
sewer system which has a total suspended solids concentration in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter or a total biochemical oxygen
demand concentration in excess of 250 milligrams per liter or an oil
and grease concentration in excess of 80 milligrams per liter, and
the charge for treatment of such industrial waste shall be
computed in accordance with the following formula: [Amended by
Ord. 965, 12/18/2014]
Total Charge = Q + [0:01 Q(TSS-250)] + [0.01 Q(BOD-250)] +
[0.01 Q(OG-80)]
Where:
Q = Quarterly metered charge
TSS = Total suspended solids in milligrams per liter
BOD = Biochemical oxygen demand in milligrams per
liter
OG = Oils/grease in milligrams per liter
§ 201 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 201
FWD:380
(4) Nutrient Surcharge. Due to the addition of nutrient limits to the
Borough's NPDES wastewater discharge permit, a nutrient
surcharge shall be imposed for any industrial waste which the
Borough consents to accept into the sewer system which has a total
nitrogen concentration in excess of 40 milligrams per liter and a
total phosphorus concentration in excess of 10 milligrams per liter,
and the charge for treatment of such industrial waste shall be
computed in accordance with the following formula: [Added by
Ord. 965, 12/18/2014]
Total Nutrient Surcharge = Q + [0.01 Q(NITROGEN-40)] + [0.01
Q(PHOSPHORUS-10)]
Where:
Q = Quarterly metered charge
NITROGEN = Total nitrogen concentration in
milligrams per liter
PHOSPHORUS = Total phosphorus concentration in
milligrams per liter
C. Multipurpose Commercial or Industrial Use. In case of a combination of
one or more private dwellings or living units with one or more
commercial or industrial establishments in one building or structure,
such unit and such establishment having the use of the sewer system
through one sewer connection, then the sewer rentals and charges shall
be determined as follows:
(1) A quarterly flat rate of $92.00 per quarter shall be imposed for each
private dwelling or each living unit. [Amended by Ord. 965, 12/
18/2014; and by Ord. 971, 12/17/2015]
(2) The nonresidential fraction of the total combined discharge shall be
determined using the rate schedule in Subsection B of this Section
allowing a credit of 15,000 gallons per quarter per residential unit
included in the combined total.
(3) In no case shall the quarterly charge be less than the total number
of residential and nonresidential units multiplied by a rate of
$92.00 per quarter. [Amended by Ord. 965, 12/18/2014; and by
Ord. 971, 12/17/2015]
(4) Where a single building or structure contains a multipurpose
commercial or industrial use and each unit and establishment has
its own separate connection to the sewer system, then the metered
charges and rentals shall be based on each separate connection as
if each unit and establishment were located in a separate structure.

considered as one establishment.
INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENT  Any structure or portion thereof
intended to be used wholly or in part for the manufacturing, fabricating,
processing, cleaning, laundering or assembling of any product,
commodity or article. In a structure where the individual units share
sanitary facilities, those units sharing the same facilities shall be
considered as one such establishment.
INDUSTRIAL WASTE  Any solid, liquid or gaseous substance or water
borne wastes or form of energy ejected or escaping from any industrial,
manufacturing, trade or business process or from the development,
recovery or processing of natural resources as distinct from sanitary
sewage.

E. Measuring Volume or Quantity.
(1) Methods of Measuring Volume or Quantity. Whenever a person
purchasing all water used from the water supplier discharges
sanitary sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system, the
volume of water used, as determined from meter readings, made
by, or made available to the Borough, shall be used in computing
the sewer rentals.
(2) In cases where persons have sources of water supply in addition to,
or other than from, the water supplier and discharge sanitary
sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system the Borough
may require owner to furnish and install at owner's cost and
expense, a meter on such additional or other source of supply. The
total amount of water used as shown by these meter readings will
be used in computing the sewer rentals.
§ 201 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 201
FWD:382
(3) In cases where persons (a) use water from the water supplier and/
or from any other source and (b) all or any part of the water so used
in not discharged into the sewer system, the quantity of water used
to determine the sewer rentals shall be computed by one of the
following methods:
(a) Method No. 1. By placing a meter or measuring device on the
sewer connection. The readings from this meter or measuring
device shall be used in computing the sewer rentals.
(b) Method No. 2. By placing a meter or measuring device on the
effluent or waste water not discharging into the sewer system.
The reading from this meter or measuring device will then be
deducted from the total water meter readings and the
remainder will be used in computing the sewer rentals.
(c) Method No. 3. When in the opinion of the Borough Manager it
is not desirable or practical to install devices to continuously
determine the quantity of water discharged to the sewer
system, the Borough Manager will determine, in such manner
and by such method as he may prescribe, the percentage of
metered water and waste discharged into the sewer system
and the quantity of water used to compute the sewer rentals
shall be the percentage so determined of the quantity
measured by the water meter or meters, or may determine the
appropriate sewer rental in any other manner which he may
deem appropriate; provided however, that any sewer rental
established by this Method No. 3 shall be reasonable in light of
sewer rentals determined by other methods established
hereunder. Any dispute as to the estimated amount shall be
submitted to Borough Council after notice of the estimate,
whose decision on the matter shall be final for the current
calendar year.

limitations imposed under this Part for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this Part.
The Borough shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR § 403.12.
3. Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Where the
Borough's sewage treatment plant achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by Federal pretreatment standards, the Borough may
apply to the regulatory authority for modification of specific limits in
the Federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean
reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the
pollutant by the sewage treatment plant to a less toxic or harmless state
in the effluent which is achieved by the system for 95% of the samples
taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in
§ 403.7(c)(2) of (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403)
 "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of
Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Act. The Borough may then
modify pollutant discharge limits in the Federal pretreatment standards
if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Part 403, § 403.7, are fulfilled
and prior approval from the regulatory authority is obtained.
4. State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than Federal
requirements and limitations or those in this Part.
5. Borough's Right to Revision. The Borough reserves the right to
establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on
discharges to the sewerage system if deemed necessary to comply with
the objectives presented in § 401(1) of this Part.
6. Excessive Discharges. No user shall ever increase the use of process
water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
§ 403 FOREWORD § 403
FWD:403
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with
the limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment
Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitations developed by
the Borough or State.
7. Accidental Discharges.
A. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by the Borough.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Borough for review, and shall be approved by the Borough before
construction of the facility.
B. No user who commences contribution to the sewerage system after
the effective date of this Part shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures
have been approved by the Borough. Review and approval of such
plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of this Part. In the case of an accidental
discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
telephone notify the Borough of the incident. The notification shall
include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, and corrective actions.
8. Written Notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the
user shall submit to the Borough a detailed written report describing
the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the sewerage system, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve
the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed by this Section or other applicable law.
9. Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's
bulletin board or prominent place advising employees whom to call in
the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all
employees who may cause or suffer a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
10. Drainage of Swimming Pools. Filter backwash lines shall be discharged
to the sewerage system as follows:
A. Sand filter backwash may be discharged directly to the sewerage
system.
B. Diatomaceous earth filter backwash shall be connected to the
sewerage system through settling tanks with a minimum of three
§ 403 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 403
FWD:404
months storage capacity for spent diatomaceous earth. The tanks
shall be readily accessible for removing solid waste for disposal.
11. Disposal of Tank Truck Waste. Tank truck waste shall not be discharged
to the sewerage system except in the event of an emergency at the sole
discretion of the Borough. The waste shall not contain industrial waste,
chemicals, or other matter, with or without pretreatment, that does not
conform to the requirements of § 403(1) of this Part. Tank truck waste
shall be discharged to the same system at the location and at the time
or times designated and at the rate of discharge fixed by the Borough.
12. Interceptors. Grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps shall be
provided when required by the Borough, for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable
wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the Borough and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
13. Garbage Grinders. The use of mechanical garbage grinders producing a
finely divided mass, properly flushed with an ample amount of water,
shall be permitted. However, no such mechanical garbage grinder to
serve premises used for commercial purposes shall be installed until
permission for such installation is obtained from the Borough.
14. Pretreatment Requirements.
A. User shall design, construct, operate and maintain wastewater
pretreatment facilities whenever necessary to reduce or modify the
user's wastewater to achieve compliance with this Part. The review
or approval of pretreatment facility plans, specifications and
operating procedures by the Borough or its consulting engineer
shall not excuse or mitigate any violations by the user of this Part or
any Federal, State or local requirements.
B. The construction of required pretreatment facilities shall be
accomplished in accordance with a reasonable completion
schedule prepared by the user and approved by the Borough. If, in
the opinion of the Borough, the schedule prepared by the user is
not reasonable, a completion schedule shall be established by the
Borough.
C. When required by the Borough to provide pretreatment facilities,
no construction of such facilities shall commence until:
(1) Construction drawings, specifications, completion schedule
and other pertinent information relating to the proposed
facilities are submitted to the Borough.
(2) The Borough provides written approval for the construction of
the proposed facilities.

D. When approved by the Borough and placed in operation,
pretreatment facilities shall be continuously maintained in
satisfactory and effective operation by the user, at his own expense.
The Borough shall have the right to inspect said facilities at any
reasonable time to insure such are being properly maintained and
operated in accordance with the requirements of the Borough.
15. Flow Equalization. The Borough reserves the right to require users
having large variations in the rate of waste discharge to install suitable
regulating devices for equalizing flows to the sewerage system. This
requirement shall apply specifically to users with a discharge
containing industrial waste slugs having an average daily flow greater
than 15% of the average daily sewage flow at the sewage treatment
plant.
1. Industrial Waste Discharge Permit.
A. General. All industrial users connected or proposing to connect to
the sewerage system shall obtain an industrial waste discharge

on industrial waste discharge permit applications shall be as
follows. Within 30 days of receipt of the application, the Borough
shall notify the applicant in writing:
(1) That the wastewater proposed to be discharged is acceptable
and a permit will be issued by the Borough.
(2) That the wastewater proposed to be discharged is
unacceptable.
(3) That the wastewater proposed to be discharged will be
acceptable provided certain action is taken and maintained by
the applicant, specifying the terms and conditions thereof.
§ 404 FOREWORD § 404
FWD:407
(4) That the Borough requires further information, studies or
tests, specifying the requirements thereof, before it can
determine whether the proposed discharge is or is not
acceptable.
E. Permit Duration. A permit shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five years or it may be issued to expire on a
specific date. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum
of 180 days prior to the expiration of an existing permit. The terms
and conditions of the permit shall be subject to modification by the
Borough during the term of the permit as limitations or
requirements are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall
be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days
prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new
conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule
for compliance.
F. Permit Transfer. Industrial waste discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A permit may not be
reassigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises or a new or changed operation without the approval of
the Borough.
G. Waste Characteristic Change. Any owner of any improved property
who is discharging industrial waste into the sewerage system and
who contemplates a change in the method of operation or in the
pretreatment facilities which will alter the type of industrial waste
then being discharged into the sewerage system shall apply for a
new industrial waste discharge permit at least 30 days prior to
such change. The revised industrial waste discharge permit will be
subject to a fee as established from time to time by resolution of
Borough Council. Approval or disapproval of a modified permit
shall be regulated by the procedures established hereunder for the
issuance of an original permit.
H. Separation of Wastes. In the case of complete separation of
domestic sewage from industrial wastes within an industrial
establishment, with the domestic wastes only discharged to the
sanitary sewer, no discharge permit fee shall be imposed on that
portion of the wastes going to the sanitary sewer.
2. Reporting Requirements for Permittee.
A. Each industrial waste permittee shall submit to the Borough 10
days prior to the first day of March, June, September and
December, an industrial waste contribution report. The report shall
be on a form provided by the Borough and shall indicate the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the industrial waste effluent. The
waste characteristics shall be based on the results of analysis of the
waste performed by a qualified laboratory. Upon specific approval
of the Borough the permittee may elect to employ in-house facilities
§ 404 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 404
FWD:408
for the analysis of certain parameters being monitored. However,
at least once per year, a split sample shall be analyzed for all
parameters being monitored in-house by both the in-house
laboratory and a qualified laboratory. The results of both
laboratories shall then be submitted to the Borough for review. The
Borough reserves the right to waive approval for the use of inhouse
facilities at any time.
B. The report shall also include the average daily flow for the
reporting period. At the discretion of the Borough and in
consideration of such factors as production schedules, budget
cycles, etc., the Borough may agree to alter the months during
which the above reports are to be submitted.
3. Sampling, Flow Measurement, Testing and Inspection.
A. Any user whose property is serviced by a sewer carrying industrial
waste shall install at his expense a suitable control manhole
together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in
the sewer to provide for inspection, sampling and measurement of
the waste. The control manhole should normally be situated on the
user's premises, but the Borough may, when such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the
faculty to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
B. There shall be ample room in or near the control manhole to allow
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The control
manhole, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense
of the user. Construction of the control manhole shall be completed
within 90 days following notification by the Borough.
C. Users discharging industrial waste to the sewerage system shall
provide the Borough and its representatives the opportunity of
access at any time, upon reasonable notice, to any improved
property served by the sewerage system as shall be required for
purposes of inspection, measurement, sampling, testing and
records examination to ascertain whether the purpose of this Part
is being met and all requirements are being complied with, and for
performance of other functions relating to service rendered by the
Borough. The Borough shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
D. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected.

These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this Part and are
separate from all other fees chargeable by the Borough.
1. Harmful Contributions.
A. The Borough may suspend wastewater treatment service and/or an
industrial waste discharge permit when such suspension is
§ 404 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 406
FWD:410
necessary, in the opinion of the Borough, in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, causes interference to the sewerage system or causes
the Borough to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
B. Any person notified of a suspension of wastewater treatment
service and/or an industrial waste discharge permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a
failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Borough shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent
or minimize damage to the sewerage system or endangerment to
any individuals. The Borough shall reinstate the industrial waste
discharge permit and/or wastewater treatment service upon proof
of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed
written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of
the harmful discharge and measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence shall be submitted to the Borough within five days
following the date of occurrence.
2. Revocation of Permit.
A. Any user who violates the following conditions is subject to having
his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this
Section of this Part:
(1) Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his discharge.
(2) Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations,
or wastewater constituents and characteristics.
(3) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring.
(4) Violation of conditions of the permit.
B. If a permit is revoked, the Borough may take any steps it deems
advisable, including severance of the sewer connection, to promote
compliance with this Part.
3. Legal Action. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or
other wastes into the sewerage system contrary to the provisions of this
Part, or any order of the Borough, the Borough Solicitor may commence
an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Court of
Common Pleas of Lancaster County.
4. Settlements. Nothing in this Part shall be construed to limit or deny the
right of the Borough or any other person to such equitable or other
remedies as may otherwise be available with or without process of law,
including payment of damages to the Borough by any person causing
§ 406 FOREWORD § 406
FWD:411
§ 407. Surcharges. [Ord. 700, 11/16/1989, § 7]
damage or injury to the sewer system. Any person who causes harm or
damage to the sewerage system as a result of a violation of this Part
shall be liable to the Borough for the full costs of such harm or damage.
1. General.
A. Discharges containing concentrations of BOD, and/or suspended
solids in excess of 250 mg/l shall be subject to a surcharge.
B. Discharges containing concentrations of BOD5 and/or suspended
solids in excess of 2,000 mg/l shall be subject to a penalty
surcharge of three times the standard surcharge rate for that
portion of the concentration in excess of 2,000 mg/l, and the
standard surcharge rate for the portion of the concentration in
excess of 250 mg/l but less than 2,000 mg/l.
2. Surcharge Formula.
A. Whenever the Borough consents to accept industrial waste into the
sewer system which has a total suspended solids concentration in
excess of 250 mg/l or BOD5, in excess of 250 mg/l, a surcharge
factor will be applied to the normal sewer bill to arrive at the
industrial surcharge bill. The surcharge factor will be computed as
follows:
Surcharge factor 0.001 x [(BOD5-250 + (TSS- 250)]
The surcharge factor cannot exceed 1.75 for BOD5 and 1.75 for
suspended solids.
B. Whenever the Borough consents to accept industrial waste into the
sewer system which has a total suspended solids concentration in
excess of 2,000 mg/l or BOD5 in excess of 2,000 mg/l, a penalty
surcharge factor will be applied to the normal sewer bill to arrive at
the industrial surcharge bill. The penalty surcharge factor will be
computed as follows:
Penalty Surcharge Factor =.003 x [(BOD5-2,000) + (TSS-2,000)]
The penalty surcharge factor is added to the surcharge factor to
determine the factor to be applied to the monthly metered charge
to arrive at the total industrial waste surcharge bill.
3. Nutrient Surcharge. Whenever the Borough consents to accept
industrial waste into the sewer system which has a total nitrogen
concentration in excess of 40 mg/l or a total phosphorus concentration
in excess of 10 mg/l, a nutrient surcharge factor will be applied to the
normal sewer bill to arrive at the industrial surcharge bill. The nutrient
surcharge factor will be computed as follows: [Added by Ord. 966, 12/
18/2014]
§ 406 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 407
FWD:412
§ 408. Responsibility of Owners of Improved Property. [Ord. 700,
11/16/1989, § 10]
The owner of each property connected to the sewerage system shall be
responsible for all acts of tenants or other occupants of such improved
property insofar as such acts shall be governed by provisions of this Part.
Nutrient surcharge factor = 0.01 x [(Nitrogen-40) + (Phosphorus-10)]
The nutrient surcharge factor is added to any other surcharge factors
to determine the factor to be applied to the monthly metered charge to
arrive at the total industrial waste surcharge bill.

refuse, vegetable, or other organic material or large pieces or
fragments of inorganic material, which, in the opinion of the
Borough, should be removed, the contractor shall excavate and
remove such unsuitable material to the width and depth
recommended by the Borough. Before pipe is laid, the subgrade
shall be formed by backfilling with 2B stone in three inch
(uncompacted thickness) layers thoroughly compacted to a Proctor
density of 95% and the bedding prepared as hereinbefore specified.
C. Special Foundations. Where the bottom of the trench at the
subgrade is found to consist of material which is unstable to such a
degree that, in the opinion of the Borough, it cannot be removed
and replaced with an approved material thoroughly compacted in
place to support the pipe properly, the contractor shall construct a
foundation for the pipe, consisting of piling, timbers or other
materials, in accordance with plans approved by the Borough.
D. Excavation in Fill. When the pipe is to be laid in fill, prior to
excavation, the fill shall be compacted to a proctor density of 95%
to a height of 12 inches above the proposed top of the pipe.
3. Backfilling Methods.

A. Unless otherwise noted, manholes shall be constructed of precast
concrete with cast iron frames and covers, as shown on Plate 1
contained herein. The invert channels shall be smooth and
semicircular in shape conforming to the inside of the adjacent
sewer section. Changes in direction of flow shall be with a smooth
curve of as large a radius as the size of the manhole will permit.
B. Changes in size and grade of the channels shall be made gradually
and evenly. The invert channels may be formed directly in the
concrete of the manhole base, may be built up with brick and
cement grout, may be half tile laid in concrete, or may be
constructed by laying full section sewer pipe through the manhole
and breaking out the top half after the surrounding concrete has
hardened. If this method is utilized, the manhole floor shall form a
neat joint with the pipe barrel. The floor of the manhole outside the
channels shall be smooth and shall have a slope toward the
channels of not less than two inches per foot and not more than
four inches per foot.
7. Lateral Sewers. Fittings, (Wye branches, risers and bends) and lateral
sewer pipe shall be furnished and installed in strict accordance with
these specifications and any and all practices and precautions required
for the main sewers are equally applicable to the lateral sewers. Lateral
sewers shall be a minimum four-inch diameter, and shall be installed to
serve all lots. Installation shall be at a minimum 1% slope, shall be to a
point five feet behind curb line or edge of street, or one foot beyond the
road right-of-way, whichever is the greater and shall include a watertight
plug at the end. Excavation, in any material, shall extend for four
feet beyond the end of the lateral for the full depth of the lateral. Prior
to backfilling, a minimum two inch x four inch wooden marker shall be
placed against the end of each lateral, and shall extend a minimum of
12 inches above the ground.

FWD:447
§ 515. Testing. [Ord. 751, 4/21/1996, § E]
8. Grade and Alignment Control. Prior to construction, the contractor
shall furnish three copies of a grade sheet for each manhole run to the
Borough. Grade and alignment control shall be established by one of
the following methods:
A. Laser  direct reading.
B. Twin string line offset.
Same "pavement restoration" specs as in water line specs.
1. Gravity Sewers.
A. Alignment. After the mains have been laid and backfill placed to a
depth of 1 1/2 feet above the top of the pipe, a light will be flashed
between manholes or manhole locations to determine whether the
alignment of the sewer is true and whether any pipe has been
displaced, broken or otherwise damaged subsequent to laying. This
test will again be conducted before final acceptance of the sewer.
Each section (manhole to manhole) of sewer shall show a good light
circle throughout its length and any and all defects shall be
corrected to the satisfaction of the Borough before acceptance.
Sewers shall be tested for leakage only after all sewers and lateral
sewers, including stoppers, are installed.
B. Leakage Tests.
(1) Each sewer section between manholes including all laterals
will be tested with low pressure air. Testing will be done only
after all back-filling has been completed and trench settlement
has been minimized. The contractor shall furnish all labor,
materials, water, tools, equipment and accessories necessary
to perform the required tests. All tests shall be made in the
presence of, and to the complete satisfaction of, the Borough.
(2) The pipe shall remain under pressure for not less than two
minutes before the test begins, to allow equilibrium of the air
temperature with the pipe wall.
(3) The minimum test pressure, measured in pounds per square
inch (psig), shall be calculated by the following formula:
(D / 2) + 2
Where D = Depth of the deeper manhole in feet
Example: D = 9.6 feet
Minimum Test Pressure = (9.6 / 2) + 2 = 6.8 psig
§ 514 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 515
FWD:448
(4) In no case shall the test pressure in the sewer or the laterals be
greater than the maximum differential joint pressure
recommended by the manufacturer of the pipe.
(5) The contractor shall repair or replace all defective material
and/or workmanship and shall conduct such additional retests
as required to demonstrate that the sewer meets the
requirements, at his own expense and at no additional cost to
the Borough. All materials and methods used to repair the
sewer shall meet with the approval of the Borough's Engineer.
2. Manhole Testing.
A. All manholes shall be tested for water infiltration. The contractor
shall furnish all labor, materials, water, tools, equipment and
accessories necessary to perform the required tests. All tests shall
be made in the presence of and to the complete satisfaction of the
Borough.
B. The manhole shall be thoroughly cleaned and all openings sealed to
the satisfaction of the Borough. All pipe openings in the base and
the wells shall be plugged with plugs properly designed to provide
a watertight seal.
(1) Vacuum Test. Manholes shall be tested by applying a negative
(vacuum) pressure measured in pounds per square inch, as
calculated by the following formula:
(D / 2) + 1
Where D = Depth of the manhole in feet
Example: D = 9.6 feet
Minimum Test Pressure = (9.6 / 2) + 1 = 5.8 psig
The manhole shall be considered acceptable if the air
infiltration does not increase the negative (vacuum) pressure
by more than one psig in the time as calculated by the
following formula:
Six minutes - (D x 10) seconds
Where D = Depth of manhole to the next even foot
Example: depth of manhole = 8.35 feet. Then D = nine
Minimum time allowed for pressure increase of one psig
= six minutes - (9 x 10) seconds = four minutes 30
seconds
(2) Water Test.
(a) The Borough may permit the testing of manholes by filling
with water.
§ 515 FOREWORD § 515
FWD:449
(b) After the manhole has been properly cleaned and sealed, it
shall be completely filled with water. To allow for the water
absorbed by the manhole, the manhole to be tested shall
be completely filled with water for a minimum period of 12
hours prior to the test.
(c) At commencement of the test, the manhole shall be filled
with water to a point level with the top of the manhole. The
amount of exfiltration shall be determined from the loss in
water level converted into gallons per day. The manhole
being tested shall be considered "acceptable" when there
is no loss in water level for a period of two hours.
(d) If any manhole fails to meet the testing requirements, the
contractor shall determine at his own expense the source
or sources of leakage.
(e) The contractor shall repair or replace all defective
material and/or workmanship and shall conduct such
additional retests as required to demonstrate that the
manhole meets the requirements, at his own expense and
at no additional cost to the Borough. All materials and
methods used to repair the man-holes shall meet with the
approval of the Borough's Engineer.
3. Hydrostatic Tests for Force Mains.
A. Pressure Test.
(1) After the pipe has been laid and backfilled as specified, all
newly laid pipe, shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of
150 pounds per square inch, or 150% of the normal working
pressure, whichever is greater.
(2) Where any section of a main is provided with concrete reaction
backing, the hydrostatic pressure test shall not be made until
at least five days have elapsed after the concrete reaction
backing was installed. If high early strength cement is used in
the concrete reaction backing, the hydrostatic pressure test
shall not be made until at least two days have elapsed.
B. Duration of Pressure Tests. The duration of each pressure test shall
be at least two hours or as determined by the Engineer.
C. Procedures. Each section of pipe shall be slowly filled with water
and the specified test pressure, based on the elevation of the lowest
point of the line or section under test and corrected to the elevation
of the test gauge, shall be applied by means of a pump connected to
the pipe in a manner satisfactory to the Borough's Engineer. The
pump, pipe connections, and all necessary apparatus, including
gauges, shall be furnished by the contractor and are subject to
§ 515 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 515
FWD:450
§ 516. Backflow Preventors. [Ord. 751, 4/21/1996, § F]
All sanitary sewer lateral connections shall be fitted with a backflow
preventor approved by the Borough Engineer. The backflow preventor shall
be located outside of the Borough's right-of-way between the unit(s) and
the right-of-way line. The backflow preventor shall be owned and become
the responsibility of the individual property owner(s) upon installation and
satisfactory testing by the Borough Engineer.
approval by the Engineer. The contractor will make all taps into the
pipe, and furnish all necessary assistance for conducting the tests.
D. Expelling Air Before Test. Before applying the specified test
pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. If permanent air
vents are not located at all high points, the contractor shall make
the necessary taps at such points before the test is made. After the
test has been completed the contractor shall remove and plug the
taps or leave them in place at the direction of the Engineer.
E. Examination Under Pressure. Any cracks or defective pipes,
fittings, or valves discovered in consequence of this pressure test,
shall be removed and replaced by the contractor with sound
material, and the test shall be repeated until satisfactory to the
Engineer.
F. Test pressure Variations. Test pressures shall not vary by more than
five psi for the duration of the test.
G. Saturation of Cement Lining. It is good practice to fill the pipeline
to be tested 24 hours in advance of the test to allow the cement
lining of the pipe to become saturated.
H. Test Failure. Should the test pressure not meet the requirements
specified above, the contractor shall, at his own expense, locate,
repair and replace the defective joints, pipe or fittings until the
pressure is maintained within the specified allowance.

excavated from the street shall be replaced with 2A modified stone
or its equivalent and compacted to within three inches of the
finished road surface.
1. Material Specifications. All materials shall conform to PennDOT Form
408, latest edition. All sidewalks and curbs shall be constructed of
3,000 pound concrete with a 4% to 6% air entrainment ingredient and a
maximum slump of three inches, constructed level on stone backfill
with a minimum thickness of four inches. The use of calcium chloride is
prohibited from the concrete used for repair or construction. Where slip
forms are used a maximum slump of 1 1/2 inches shall be permitted.
High early concrete must be used when slip forming. No concrete shall
be placed when the air temperature is below 40° F. Curing compound
may be applied to retain moisture to allow for the complete hydration of
the concrete. No material such as asphalt, macadam or blacktop shall
be substituted for these specifications.
2. Forms. Forms shall be of wood or metal, straight, free from warp, and of
sufficient strength to resist the pressure of the concrete without
springing. If of wood, they shall be two inch planks, surfaced on the
inside and the top. Forms shall be of a depth equal to the depth of the
concrete. A front and back form shall be used for curb except where a
good concrete sidewalk, which is not removed, abuts the new curb.
Forms shall be accurately set to line and grade in such a manner as to
prevent settlement or displacement.
3. Finishing. All forms must be removed within 24 hours after the concrete
has been placed, and minor defects shall be filled with mortar
composed of one part Portland cement and two parts fine aggregate.
The top and face of the curb from the top of 10 inches below or to the
top of the street surface, when in place, shall be finished while the
concrete is still green by rubbing the surface with a carborundum
stone, soft brick or wood blocks and water until smooth, even surface is
produced. All joints in the curb shall be promptly opened from top to
bottom and edges adjacent to the joints shall be sharp and clean cut.
Sidewalks shall be finished after pouring before the concrete sets.
4. Curbing. Concrete curbs and sidewalks shall be protected from
rainstorms with paper, burlap, canvas, or similar materials. Curing
compound may be applied to retain moisture in concrete to allow
complete hydration of the cement. Plastic, burlap, straw, or other types
of moisture bearer must be used to maintain concrete wet during the
drying process for at least seven days after pouring, if curing compound
is not used. No concrete shall be placed when the temperature is below
40° F. To help prevent spalling and deterioration of concrete surface

Reconstruction or Resurfacing. [Ord. 612, 8/15/1978]
§ 206. Excavation and Restoration Procedures. [Ord. 612, 8/15/
1978]
1. When the Borough or the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
proposes to reconstruct or resurface any street, the Borough shall first
serve notice of such improvements to all persons owning property
abutting the street about to be improved and to all public utility
companies operating in the Borough. Within 90 calendar days from
receipt of such notice, all notified persons shall complete or cause to be
completed all necessary repairs and replacements of utility mains,
service connections and/or laterals existing under the street and
designated curb and sidewalk areas. Notified persons shall also
complete or cause to be completed all new installations under the street
and designated curb and sidewalk areas required for use within a fiveyear
period thereafter. All repairs, replacements and new installations
shall be in first-class condition so that the same cannot be reasonably
expected to require repairs or replacement within a period of at least
five years thereafter.
2. Upon failure of any of the notified persons to comply with the notice
from the Borough to place the same in first-class condition as
hereinbefore provided, the Borough may cause existing utility mains,
service connections and/or laterals to be placed in first-class condition
or to be entirely removed if not used or necessary for public
convenience, whereupon the Borough shall be entitled to collect the
cost of such renewals, repairs, caulking, removal or other work from
the responsible person or persons, either by invoicing the person or
persons or, in the case of water or sewer house connections, by filing
municipal liens therefor against the abutting properties benefited by
such conditions.
3. Nothing herein contained shall forbid the installation of new pipes,
conduits or other services or structures or the repair, replacement or
removal of those already existing in or under the portions of such
highways improved as aforesaid, by tunneling beneath paving in
accordance with this Part and under the supervision of the Borough or
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, upon obtaining a
permit therefor from the Borough and upon payment to the Borough of
the fees prescribed by the provisions of this Part for making a surface
opening in the highway of the same dimensions.
1. Safety Devices Required. It shall be the duty of any person, partnership,
firm or corporation to whom a permit is issued or by whom any opening
or excavation is made, as aforesaid, to provide and maintain proper and
adequate guards, barriers and lights to prevent accidents, and they
shall assume all risks and be liable for all damages by reason of the
openings and excavations and by reason of any failure to properly fill
§ 205 FOREWORD § 206
FWD:485
the hole or trench and maintain the disturbed surface in a safe
condition.
2. Excavation and Backfill Regulations.
A. It shall be unlawful to make any excavation or tunnel in any way
contrary to or at variance with the terms of the permit therefor.
Proper bracing shall be maintained to prevent the collapse of
adjoining ground or structures.
B. No injury shall be done to any pipes, cables, conduits or structures
in the making of such excavations or tunnels, and notice shall be
given to the persons maintaining any such pipes, cables, conduits
or structures which are or may be endangered or affected by the
making of any such excavation or tunnel, before such pipes, cables,
conduits or structures shall be disturbed and before any work shall
commence.
C. No unnecessary damage or injury shall be done to any trees or
shrubs or the roots thereof.
D. All work shall be confined to the public right-of-way, and in no case
shall excavated material be cast beyond the curb or on sidewalks or
lawns. Where working space is limited, the Borough may require
material excavated from the trench to be hauled from the area and
then brought back after the pipe or structure has been installed.
E. The Borough may limit the amount of open trench if, in its
judgment, it is necessary for safety, movement of traffic, proper
drainage or any other cause whatsoever.
3. Excavation. Before trenching begins, the existing paving shall be cut to
neat lines equidistant from the center line of the trench by means of
equipment suitable for such work, and the edges of the pavement shall
be protected and maintained throughout the course of construction
until the permanent paving is completed. If the pavement edges are not
maintained to the satisfaction of the Borough Manager, the pavement
shall be recut just prior to the permanent pavement replacement.
Pavement cutting may be done with either a saw or an air compressor.
However, the Borough reserves the right to require a saw if cutting with
an air compressor is unsatisfactory. All openings shall be square or
rectangular in shape.
4. Backfill.
A. All excavation in trenches shall be backfilled to the original ground
surface or to the subgrades specified for paving restoration. The
backfill shall begin as soon as is practical after the pipe or other
construction has been placed and shall be carried on as rapidly as
the protection of the balance of the work will permit. Depositing
backfill shall be done so that the shock of falling material will not
injure the pipe, structure or adjacent structures.
§ 206 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 206
FWD:486
B. Backfill material to a height not to exceed 12 inches above the top
of the pipe may be suitable, trench-excavated clean earth backfill
material, free from stones. This backfill material shall be deposited
in the trench simultaneously on both sides of the pipe for the full
width of the trench, in increments not exceeding six inches, and
shall be hand tamped to fill completely all spaces under and
adjacent to the pipe. The remaining trench-excavated material
shall be removed from the job site. The trench shall then be backfilled
with No. 2RC aggregate, meeting the requirements of
§ 703.3(D) of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Form
408. Compaction of the 2RC backfill shall be done with a
mechanical tamper up to the bottom elevation of the pavement
structure in lifts of uniform layers not to exceed six inches after
compaction, and each lift shall be compacted over the full width of
the excavated area. Backfill shall be compacted to at least 90% of
Standard Proctor Density at optimum moisture content. All
compaction shall be accomplished at a moisture content within,
plus or minus, 2% of the optimum.
C. Special compaction shall be done around all valves, hydrants and
other structures and utilities by the use of pneumatic tampers,
plate tampers or plate vibrators with lifts not to exceed that
previously stated.
D. If unsatisfactory backfilling is suspected, the Borough may cause
samples to be taken at any location and depth of trench and tests to
be performed to determine whether compaction operations are
sufficient to meet the density and optimum moisture requirements
specified above. All costs of samples and tests shall be at the
expense of the applicant.
5. Pavement Restoration.
A. After the trench has been properly backfilled as hereinbefore
required, permanent-type paving restoration shall be installed as
follows:
(1) Prior to the placement of the base course, the existing base
and surface shall be sawed or cut back six inches on either side
of the trench to neat straight lines parallel to the curb or to the
edge of the pavement. Generally, the pavement restoration
shall be of consistent width. Where the width of paving must be
widened or decreased, it shall be done by boxing to give neat
perpendicular lines. A tack coat of Type E-1 bituminous
material meeting the requirements of § 460 of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Form 408 shall be
applied to the cut surfaces. The base course, consisting of
either a crushed aggregate base course or a bituminous
concrete base course shall then be placed.
§ 206 FOREWORD § 206
FWD:487
(a) If the crushed aggregate base course is used, said base
course shall have a thickness at least as thick as the
existing base course, but in no case shall the base course
be less than eight inches compacted thickness of No. 4
aggregate tied in with No. 1 aggregate screenings,
meeting the requirements of § 310 of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Form 408. Following the
placement of the base course, a prime coat of bituminous
material meeting the requirements of § 461 of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Form 408
shall be required. After the prime coat has cured, a
bituminous binder course shall be placed, such binder
course to have a thickness at least as thick as the existing
binder course, but in no case shall the binder course be
less than 1 1/2 inches compacted thickness. The
completed surface of the binder course shall not be less
than the required compacted thickness of the wearing
course below the surface of the adjacent pavement. A
bituminous wearing course as hereinafter described shall
then be placed.
(b) If a bituminous concrete base course is used, said base
course shall consist of a minimum of five inches compacted
thickness of bituminous concrete base course meeting the
requirements of § 305 of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Form 408. The completed surface of the
base course shall not be less than the required compacted
thickness of the wearing course below the surface of the
adjacent pavement. A bituminous wearing course as
hereinafter described shall then be placed.
(2) A bituminous concrete wearing course of ID-2A material shall
then be placed. The thickness of said wearing course shall be
at least as thick as the existing bituminous wearing course, but
in no case shall the wearing course be less than 1 1/2 inches
compacted thickness. A seal coat of bituminous material
meeting the requirements of § 470 of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Form 408 shall then be applied
at the edges of the wearing surface.
(3) Permanent paving restoration shall be performed immediately
after trenches have been acceptably backfilled. Where
permanent-type paving restoration is not permitted because of
weather limitations on placement of bituminous concrete, as
defined in § 401.3(a) of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Form 408, temporary paving shall be required.
Temporary paving shall consist of a layer of Type 2P-B

STANDARDS FOR STREET DESIGN, IMPROVEMENT AND
MAINTENANCE
§ 501. General. [Ord. 667, 2/11/1988, § 1]
The standards and requirements contained in this Part shall apply as
minimum design standards for subdivision and/or land developments.
§ 502. Street System. [Ord. 667, 2/11/1988, § 2]
§ 503. Design Standards. [Ord. 667, 2/11/1988, § 3; as amended by
Ord. 829, 11/15/2001; by Ord. 858, 5/19/2005]
1. Proposed streets shall be properly related to the road and highway
plans of the State, County and Borough. Streets shall be designed to
provide adequate vehicular access to all lots or parcels and with regard
for topographic conditions, projected volumes of traffic and further
subdivision possibilities in the area.
2. The street system of the proposed subdivision or land development
shall be designed to create a hierarchy of street functions which
includes collector and local streets.
3. The street system of a proposed subdivision or land developments shall
be designed so as to minimize street intersections and pedestrianvehicular
conflict points.
4. Proposed local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through
traffic and excessive speeds. However, the subdivider or land developer
shall give adequate consideration to provisions for the extension and
continuation of arterial and collector streets into and from adjoining
properties.
5. Streets shall be designed in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan,
Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27], Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance [Chapter 22] and other related ordinances and regulations in
effect in the Borough.
1. Private Streets. Private streets are prohibited unless they meet the
design standards of these regulations. Plans which propose a private
street shall be accompanied by an agreement which shall be recorded
with the final plan. This agreement shall establish the conditions under
which the street will be constructed and maintained, as well as
conditions controlling an offer of dedication and shall stipulate:
A. That the street shall be constructed and maintained to conform to
the specifications of this Part.
B. That the owners of the abutting lots will include with any future
offer for dedication sufficient monies, as estimated by the Borough,
to restore the street to conformance with the prevailing standards.
§ 501 FOREWORD § 503
FWD:495
C. That an offer for dedication of the street shall be made only for the
street as a whole.
D. The method of assessing maintenance and repair cost.
E. That an agreement by the owners of 51% of the front footage
thereon shall be binding on the owners of the remaining lots.
2. Arrangement. Streets shall be designed with consideration to both
existing and planned streets. All streets shall be arranged to conform as
closely as possible to the original topography. Streets which serve as
connector routes to population centers shall be connected with streets
of similar function, to form continuation thereof. Streets shall be laid
out to provide convenient and safe access to the property. The rigid
rectangular street pattern need not be adhered to, the use of
curvilinear streets and cul-de-sacs may be provided when their use will
result in a more desirable layout. Where a development abuts an
existing or proposed major street, the Borough may require the use of
reverse frontage lots or such other treatment that will provide
protection for abutting properties, reduce the number of intersections
with the major street and separate the local and through traffic. Any
new street proposing a connection between two existing state roads
shall be designed as a collector street and shall be designated as a
limited-access collector street. Access to a limited-access collector
street shall be only by means of a local street or a service street due to
the anticipated increased traffic using such a street; no individual
driveway access shall be permitted.
3. Street Provisions for Future Development. Where appropriate, areas
shall be reserved for future street usage in conjunction with the
development of adjacent tracts. Areas reserved for future street usage
will not be required to be improved. However, these areas shall be
reserved for street improvements to be provided by the developer of the
adjacent tract. Wherever there exists a dedicated or platted area
reserved for future street usage along the boundary of a tract being
developed, the adjacent street shall be extended into the proposed
project provided this use is not adverse to the manmade or natural
features of the site.
4. Half Streets. Half or partial streets (less than the required right-of-way
or cartway width) will not be permitted. All plans shall be designed to
provide for the entire required right-of-way and cartway.
5. Vertical Alignments. Vertical street alignments shall be measured along
the centerline. The minimum grade of all streets shall be 0.75% and the
maximum grade shall be 10%.
A. Vertical curves shall be used in changes in grade exceeding 1%.
The minimum lengths (in feet) of vertical curves shall be 15 times
the algebraic difference in grade. For example, if a 3% upgrade is
followed by 4% downgrade, the algebraic difference in grade is
§ 503 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 503
FWD:496
seven (+3  (-4) = 7); the minimum length of the vertical curve
would then be 105 feet (15 x 7 = 105).
B. Where the approaching grade exceeds 7% on any or all streets at a
four way street intersection or the terminating street at a three way
intersection, a leveling area shall be provided on the street(s) with
such excessive grade. Such leveling area(s) shall have a maximum
grade of 4% for a minimum length of 75 feet measured from the
intersection of the centerlines.
6. Horizontal Alignments. Horizontal street alignments shall be measured
along the centerline. Horizontal curves shall be used at all angles in
excess of 2°. Single, long-radius curves shall be used rather than a
series of curves with varying radii and/or a series of short curves
separated by short, straight segments. The minimum horizontal curve
radius for streets shall be 150 feet, except as provided below.
A. Perimeter Streets. Plans with street locations along the perimeter
of a property shall be required to show building setback lines and
clear sight triangles within the adjacent properties. The applicant
shall obtain permission from the adjacent landowner for the
establishment of the clear sight triangle and setback lines.
B. Cartway Alignment. The centerline of the street cartway shall
correspond with the centerline of the street right-of-way.
C. Collector streets designated as limited-access collector streets
shall be designed with a minimum horizontal radius of 1,000 feet.
Any street which provides a connection between two state roads
shall be designated as limited-access collector streets.
7. Extension of Existing Streets. The extension of existing streets which
are presently constructed with a cartway different from the standards
of this Part shall be provided with a transition area, the design of which
is subject to Borough approval.
8. Street Intersections.
A. Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two
streets are prohibited.
B. The distance between the centerline of streets opening onto the
opposite sides of existing or proposed streets shall be no less than
150 feet between centerlines, measured along the centerline of the
street being intersected.
C. Intersections with major streets shall be located not closer than
1,000 feet, measured from centerline to centerline, along the
centerline of the major street being intersected.
D. Right angle intersections shall be used whenever possible. No
street shall intersect another at an angle of less than 75°.
§ 503 FOREWORD § 503
FWD:497
E. The cartway edge at street intersections shall be rounded by a
tangential arc with a minimum radius of 20 feet for local streets
and 30 feet for intersections involving major streets. The right-ofway
radii at intersections shall be substantially concentric with the
edge of the cartway.
9. Sight Distance at Street Intersections.
A. There shall be provided and maintained at all intersections a clear
sight triangle with a line of sight between points 100 feet from the
intersection of the street centerlines. Clear sight triangles shall be
indicated on all plans. No building or other obstruction that would
obscure the vision of a motorist shall be permitted within these
areas.
B. Proper sight distance shall be provided with respect to both
horizontal and vertical road alignments at all intersections. The
sight distance measured from the centerline of the intersecting
street with the right-of-way of the intersected street, four feet
above grade, shall be a minimum of 300 feet.
C. All streets intersecting a State Route shall be subject to the
approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the
Borough.
10. Cul-de-sac Streets. Cul-de-sacs are prohibited.
11. Service Streets (Alleys). Service streets are permitted only where
required to provide direct driveway access to arterial streets.
Additional use of service streets may be permitted by waiver provided
that the applicant produces evidence satisfactory for the need and
provided these are not the primary means of access.
A. Where permitted, service streets shall have a minimum of 20 feet.
However, where service streets serve parcels on only one side, the
Borough may permit a paved surface of not less than 12 feet.
B. No part of any dwelling, garage or other structure shall be located
within 16 feet of the centerline of a service street.
C. Dead end service streets should be avoided, but where this proves
impossible, dead end service streets shall be terminated with a
paved, circular turnaround with a minimum radius to the outer
pavement edge of 40 feet.
12. Driveways. Driveways shall be so located as to provide reasonable sight
distances at intersections with streets. Driveway locations shall be
delineated on all land development plans. Subdivision plans may
delineate locations or include a notice of conformity to this
specification.
§ 503 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 503
FWD:498
§ 504. Improvement Standards.
13. Dead End Streets. Dead end streets, other than approved cul-de-sacs,
shall be prohibited except as stubs to permit future street extension
into adjoining tracts.
14. New Street Right-of-way and Cartway Widths. The minimum street
rights-of-way and cartway widths for new streets shall be as follows:
A. Arterial Street. Provides for intercommunity travel, carrying large
volumes of traffic and connecting the Borough with major
population or commercial centers. Right-of-way width shall be the
greater of 100 feet or as specified by the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation based upon the projected average daily traffic
and speed limit. Cartway width shall be the greater of 44 feet or as
specified by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEE
§ 501. Completion of Improvements or Guarantee thereof
Prerequisite to final Plat Approval. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985; § 502; as
amended by Ord. 829, 11/15/2001]
1. No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plat
have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this Chapter
and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade
trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
improvements as may be required by this Chapter have been installed
in accordance with this Chapter. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat,
including improvements or fees otherwise required by this Chapter, the
developer may deposit with the Borough of Elizabethtown financial
security in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of such
improvements or common amenities including basins and other related
drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space improvements, or
buffer or screen plantings which may be required.
2. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Borough Council, shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plat or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial
improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of
contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the
financial security agreement is not executed within 90 days unless a
written extension is granted by the Borough Council; such extension
shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the
request of the developer.
3. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Borough of Elizabethtown may approve, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending
institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow
accounts in such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable
financial security for the purposes of this Section.
4. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the
party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
Commonwealth.
5. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
§ 501 FOREWORD § 501
FWD:535
6. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the developer. Annually, the Borough of Elizabethtown may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for
the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of
the ninetieth day after either the original date scheduled for completion
or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment,
the Borough or Elizabethtown may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security equals
said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the developer in
accordance with this subsection.
7. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The Borough
of Elizabethtown, upon the recommendation of the Borough engineer,
may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the
applicant or developer and the Borough of Elizabethtown are unable to
agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and
recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in this
Commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Borough of Elizabethtown
and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the third
engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final
estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the
services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the Borough of
Elizabethtown and the applicant or developer.
8. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
9. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Borough Council may authorize submission of final plats by sections or
stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to
improvements in future section or stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
10. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough Council to
release or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of
the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or
§ 501 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 501
FWD:536
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing
addressed to the Borough Council, and the Borough Council shall have
45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Borough
engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough Council that such portion
of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance
with the approved plat. Upon such certification the Borough Council
shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution
of an amount as estimated by the Borough engineer fairly representing
the value of the improvements completed or, if the Borough Council
fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the Borough Council shall
be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The
Borough Council may, prior to final release at the time of completion
and certification by its engineer, require retention of 10% of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
11. Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Borough Council may
require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of
said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plat for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as
otherwise required in this Section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed
15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
12. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Borough of Elizabethtown,
financial security to assure proper completion and maintenance thereof
shall be posted in accordance with the regulations of the controlling
public utility or municipal authority and shall not be included within the
financial security as otherwise required by this Section.
13. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as
set forth in this Section, the Borough of Elizabethtown shall not
condition the issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to
the erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon
the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat upon actual completion
of the improvements depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if
said financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for any
building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the
improvement of the streets providing access to and from existing public
roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise
permanently passable condition, as well as the completion of all other
improvements as depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot
or lots or beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are
§ 501 FOREWORD § 501
FWD:537
§ 502. Release from Improvement Bond. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985,
§ 503; as amended by Ord. 829, 11/15/2001; and by Ord. 897, 7/17/
2008
necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or
buildings.
14. All forms of improvement guarantees, as listed herein, shall contain
language acceptable to the Borough insuring that the respective
guarantee is automatically renewable, and shall not expire or terminate
without the expressed prior written approval of the Borough.
1. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough Council, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough
engineer. The Borough Council shall, within 10 days after receipt of
such notice, direct and authorize the Borough engineer to inspect all of
the aforesaid improvements. The Borough engineer shall, thereupon,
file a report in writing, with the Borough Council, and shall promptly
mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail.
The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Borough engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Borough
Council; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or
rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said
improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Borough engineer, said report shall contain a statement
of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
2. The Borough Council shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered
mail of the action of said Borough Council with relation thereto.
3. If the Borough Council or the Borough engineer fails to comply with the
time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be
deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released
from all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other
security agreement.
4. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to
complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
5. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Borough Council or the Borough
engineer.
6. Where herein reference is made to the Borough engineer, he shall be as
a consultant thereto.
§ 501 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 502
FWD:538
7. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Borough of
Elizabethtown for the reasonable and necessary expense incurred for
the inspection or improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted
by resolution of the Borough Council and as from time to time amended.
Such expense shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary
and customary fees charged by the Borough engineer or consultant for
work performed for similar services in the community, but in no event
shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the engineer or
consultant to the Borough of Elizabethtown when fees are not
reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants.
A. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense
in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant
shall, within 10 working days of the date of billing, notify the
Borough of Elizabethtown that such expenses are disputed as
unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the Borough of
Elizabethtown shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land
development application or any approval or permit related to
development due to the applicant's request over disputed engineer
expenses.
B. If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the Borough of
Elizabethtown and the applicant cannot agree on the amount of
expenses which are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant
and the Borough of Elizabethtown shall jointly, by mutual
agreement, appoint another professional engineer licensed as such
in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to review the said expenses
and make a determination as to the amount thereof which is
reasonable and necessary.
C. The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence
and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his
or her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within
50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay
the entire amount determined in the decision immediately.
D. In the event that the Borough of Elizabethtown and applicant
cannot agree upon the professional engineer to be appointed within
20 days of the billing date, then, upon application of either party,
the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial
district in which the Borough of Elizabethtown is located (or if at
the time there be no President Judge, then the senior active judge
then sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case, shall be
neither the Borough engineer nor any professional engineer who
has been retained by, or performed services for, the Borough of
Elizabethtown or the applicant within the preceding five years.
E. The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in
§ 502 FOREWORD § 502
FWD:539
the decision is less than the original bill by 1,000 or more, the
Borough of Elizabethtown shall pay the fee of the professional
engineer, but otherwise the Borough of Elizabethtown and the
applicant shall each pay 1/2 of the fee of the appointed professional
engineer.
8. No improvement shall be considered complete until the developer shall
submit to the Borough one Mylar and two prints of the as-constructed
plan, at the same size and scale of the approved plans, showing the
following:
A. Actual location of all concrete monuments and/or markers which
were found or set at all angle breaks, points of curvature and
tangents around the perimeter of the total tract. When the outside
perimeter of a tract falls within or along an existing road right-ofway,
then the right-of-way of that roadway shall be monumented at
the above-referenced points.
B. Actual location of all iron pins or drill holes in curbs for all
individual lot lines.
C. Actual cul-de-sac radius.
D. Actual horizontal location of cartway center line versus right-ofway

constructed conditions.
9. If an improvement has been dedicated to the Borough, such
improvement shall not be considered complete until the developer has
presented a deed of dedication in a form acceptable to the Borough
Solicitor, has presented a title insurance policy or certificate of title
demonstrating good and marketable title, and has paid any fees
required to process the acceptance of the dedication.
§ 502 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 503
FWD:540
§ 503. Dedication of Improvements. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985, § 504]
All improvements shall be deemed to be private improvements and only
for the benefit of the specific project until such time as the same have
been offered for dedication and formally accepted by the Borough Council
by formal document. No responsibility of any kind with respect to
improvements shown on the final plan shall be transferred until the
improvements have been formally accepted.
§ 504. Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements. [Ord. 663,
6/20/1985; as added by Ord. 829, 11/15/2001]
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this Chapter or in accord with the approved final
plat the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any
corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If the proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient
to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Borough Council may, at its
option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action
to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such
security, and not for any other Borough purpose.

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 601. Application. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985, § 601; as amended by Ord.
897, 7/17/2008]
1. The standards and requirements contained in this Chapter shall apply
as minimum design standards for subdivisions and/or land
developments within the Borough. In addition, subdivisions and/or land
developments shall be designed to comply with the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27], the Stormwater Management
Ordinance [Chapter 27], and regulations of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation, as applicable.
2. All proposed subdivisions and/or land developments shall be designed,
laid out, arranged, constructed and coordinated with all presently
existing facilities and improvements which serve the tract proposed to
be developed, including but not limited to the (a) transportation
network, (b) sewer collection, conveyance and treatment facilities, (c)
water supply and distribution facilities, and (d) stormwater
management facilities, as necessary to accommodate prospective
traffic, provide adequate sewer and water service, promote proper
stormwater management, facilitate fire protection, prevent flooding
and conform to the Comprehensive Plan, including any urban growth
boundary, the Official Map, and any regulations or plans adopted in
furtherance thereof. All proposed subdivisions and/or land
developments shall also be designed, laid out, arranged, constructed
and coordinated to ensure that abutting properties will continue to
have safe and convenient access in accordance with the standards of
this Chapter or, if such properties do not presently have such access, to
have access at least equal to the level existing prior to the proposed
subdivision and/or land development. The applicant shall submit
studies and reports with the preliminary plan and the final plan which
shall clearly identify any assumed, proposed and required
improvements to existing facilities. If an applicant submits a study,
report or plan which contains improvements assumed to be installed by
others and compliance with the design standards in this Chapter is
based upon the completion of such assumed improvements, the design
standards of this Chapter shall not be considered as met unless the
applicant presents evidence that a governmental entity has budgeted
funds and/or has entered into contracts for the assumed improvements
or unless a plan for another development which proposes the
installation of such improvements has been approved and recorded.
A. Whenever the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27] provides that the use
proposed by the applicant for subdivision and/or land development
approval shall constitute a use by special exception or a conditional
use, the applicant shall obtain such special exception or conditional
use approval from the Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council,
as applicable, prior to the submission of the preliminary plan. The
§ 601 FOREWORD § 601
FWD:543
§ 602. Blocks and Lots. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985, § 602]
plan shall be designed and developed in accordance with any
conditions which the Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as
applicable, has imposed upon such approval.
B. Whenever the applicant proposes to develop a subdivision and/or
land development in a manner that would require a variance from
any requirements of the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27], the
applicant shall obtain such variance from the Zoning Hearing
Board prior to the submission of the preliminary plan. The plan
shall be designed and developed in accordance with any conditions
which the Zoning Hearing Board has imposed upon the grant of
such variance or variances.
C. Whenever all or a portion of the land contained within an
application for subdivision or land development approval
constitutes all or a portion of land included in a prior subdivision or
land development plan approved by the Borough or the County
Planning Commission and recorded in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds in and for Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the plan shall
comply with all conditions, restrictions and notes imposed on the
prior approval and/or included upon the recorded subdivision or
land development plan. The applicant shall identify all prior
recorded subdivision and/or land development plans of which all or
a portion of the land contained in the plan was a part and all
conditions, restrictions and notes which affect the current
application. Failure to identify all applicable conditions,
restrictions and notes of record on prior plans constitutes a
violation of this Chapter. The applicant shall submit with the
application for preliminary plan approval a statement identifying
the prior plans reviewed; the conditions, restrictions and notes
which would impact development in accordance with the plan for
which approval has been requested; and an explanation of the
manner in which the proposed plan has been designed to comply
with such conditions, restrictions and notes. This information shall
be signed by the applicant or the applicant's engineer or landscape
architect.
1. The configuration of blocks and lots shall be based upon the lot area
requirements, salient natural features, existing man-made features and
the proposed type of structure. Lot configurations should provide for
flexibility in building locations, while providing safe vehicular and
pedestrian circulation.
2. Residential Blocks. All blocks in a residential subdivision shall have
maximum length of 1,600 feet.
3. Nonresidential Blocks. Blocks in nonresidential areas may vary from
the requirement of § 602(2) when required by the nature of the use.

Easements for sanitary sewer facilities, stormwater drainage facilities,
public utilities or pedestrian access shall meet the standards listed below.
Adequate provisions shall be made for traffic circulation and
satisfactory fire protection.
4. Lot and Parcel Configuration.
A. Whenever practical, side lot lines shall be radial to street lines.
B. In order to avoid jurisdictional problems, lot lines shall, whenever
feasible, follow Borough boundaries rather than cross them.
C. All lots shall front on a street, except a service street.
D. Double frontage lots are prohibited except where provided as
reverse frontage lots. Reverse frontage lots are only permitted
when a reduction of driveway intersections along a street with a
high volume of vehicular movements is desired. All reverse
frontage shall include an identification of the frontage for use as a
road access.
1. A building setback line shall be provided along each street. The area in
front of the building setback line shall be preserved from structural
development.
2. In the case of corner lots, the setback from each adjacent street shall
apply.
A. To the fullest extent possible, easements shall be adjacent to property
lines.
B. Nothing shall be placed, planted, set or put within the area of an
easement that would adversely affect the function of the easement or
conflict with the easement agreement.
C. The applicant shall reserve easements where storm water or surface
water drainage facilities are existing or proposed, whether located
within or beyond the boundaries of the property.
D. All easements shall clearly identify who has the right-of-access and
responsibility of maintenance.
E. In existing structures, the excessive use of easements, as determined by
Borough Council upon recommendation from the Planning Commission,
shall be sufficient grounds for denying the approval of a preliminary or
final plan. Excessive use of easements may be defined as those
easements which may eventually create undesirable conditions for
future property owners.

other property lines.
3. Monuments shall be of concrete or stone, with a flat top having a
minimum width or diameter of four inches and a minimum length of 30
inches. Concrete monuments shall be marked with a 3/4 inch copper or
brass dowel; stone or precast monuments shall be marked on the top
with a proper inscription and a drill hole. Markers shall consist of iron
pipes or steel bars at least 30 inches long and not less than 3/4 of an
inch in diameter.
4. All monuments and markers shall be placed by a registered engineer or
surveyor so that the scored or marked point shall coincide exactly with
the point of intersection of lines being monumented or marked.
5. All existing and proposed monuments and lot lines markers shall be
delineated on the final plan.
1. General Requirements. The following general requirements and
minimum standards shall be followed on all subdivision and land
development applications:
A. Improper Width. Where a subdivision abuts an existing street of
improper width or alignment, the Borough may require the
dedication of land sufficient to widen the street or correct the
alignment.
B. Resubdivision. If the lots in the development are large enough for
resubdivision, or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, suitable
access and street openings for such an eventuality shall be
provided.
C. Clear Sight Triangle. There shall be provided and maintained at all
intersections a clear sight triangle with a line of sight between
points 100 feet from the intersection of the street centerlines. Clear
sight triangles shall be indicated on all plans. No building or other
obstruction that would obscure the vision of a motorist shall be
permitted within these areas.
D. Driveways. Driveways shall be so located as to provide reasonable
sight distances at intersection with streets. Driveway location shall
be determined on all land development plans. Subdivision plans

Ord. 897, 7/17/2008]
The following specific traffic control and access requirements shall be met
for developments which produce 100 peak-hour directional trips:
6. Ground Cover. Ground cover shall be provided on all areas of the
project to prevent soil erosion. All areas which are not covered by
paving, stone or other solid material shall be protected with a
vegetative growth.
A. If any traffic signals are to be installed, the distance between any new
and/or existing signals shall be at least 1,000 feet, unless it can be
demonstrated that adjacent traffic signals can operate sufficiently at
lesser distances.
B. Design of proposed development access points shall take into
consideration the horizontal and vertical grades of the existing road
network in the traffic study area to permit safe and convenient access
to the site as defined in the latest PennDOT standards and regulations.
The developer shall demonstrate that each access point is located so as
to provide the optimum safe and convenient access given the horizontal
and vertical grades of the existing road network. The developer shall
present all engineering data necessary to demonstrate that its
proposed access point or points meet this standard. If the developer
desires to locate an access point at a location which does not provide
the optimum safe and convenient access given existing conditions, the
developer shall demonstrate that the developer shall take action
necessary to provide equally safe and convenient access. All
modifications required to meet these regulations will be the
responsibility of the developer.
C. The developer shall demonstrate, by using the latest PennDOT
standards and regulations, that the proposed use will not create traffic
patterns and movements which will jeopardize the traveling public.
(1) Stacking of sufficient length shall be provided in all traffic lanes on
the site and on abutting roadways to ensure that there shall be no
blockage of through traffic. The design and length of the stacking
lanes shall be justified and supported by the queuing analysis
required as part of the traffic study.
(2) Street and/or access drives to and within the site shall be designed
in a manner that blockage of through traffic by vehicles attempting
to enter or exit on these streets or access drives will not occur.
(3) Acceleration, deceleration and turning lanes within the site and on
the abutting roadways shall be of sufficient lengths to accomplish
their intended use.
§ 611 FOREWORD § 612
FWD:549
D. If reduction of the speed limit, installation of traffic control devices,
limitation of parking or turning movements or similar measures are
required to mitigate traffic impacts upon Borough or State highways,
the applicant shall present traffic studies performed in accordance with
PennDOT regulations and Publication No. 201, Engineering and Traffic
Study Regulations. The erection or the installation of such traffic
control devices shall be in accordance with PennDOT regulations. If the
enactment of an ordinance is necessary to effectuate the traffic
regulations or the installation of the traffic control device, the applicant
shall reimburse the Borough for all expenses in the preparation and
enactment of the necessary ordinance.
E. No street or access drive shall be located in a manner which would limit
access to or exiting from abutting properties gaining access from the
existing street with which a proposed street or access drive will
intersect, unless the developer provides such lots with alternate access
from the proposed street system or internal circulation system of the
proposed development in a manner acceptable to each affected lot
owner. It shall be the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that such
access is acceptable to all owners of an affected lot. For the purpose of
this provision, limitation of access shall include the limitation of turning
movements into or exiting the abutting property or properties gaining
access from the existing street, whether by traffic regulations,
installation of barriers to prevent turning movements, installation of
additional traffic lanes in front of a property, or difficulties or delays
resulting from increased traffic flows.
F. Where new intersections are being established to serve as access to the
proposed development, these intersections must be designed to at least
operate at Level of Service C or better.
G. For access points to the proposed development and any major
intersections on abutting streets where traffic signal control may be
required or is being proposed, a traffic signal warrant analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the requirements of PennDOT
Publication 201 or any future PennDOT regulations governing
installation of traffic signals. A left-turn lane and/or a right-turn lane
shall be provided by the developer if the traffic signal warrant analysis
or any traffic signal permit issued by PennDOT requires such turning
lane(s). The developer shall additionally provide an analysis to
determine the type of signal phasing required. All costs associated with
any traffic signal proposed by the developer shall be borne by the
developer, and the Borough shall not execute any traffic signal permit
application if the execution of the application will require the Borough
to assume any costs whatsoever.
H. Emergency traffic signal preemption shall be addressed and provided
as required by PennDOT regulations and as requested by emergency
service providers.

2008]
I. Additional left and right turning lanes shall be provided to address the
existing roadway site conditions and access to the proposed
development at the cost of the developer where the traffic study
indicates that such turning lanes are necessary or desirable for safe and
convenient access into the site or exiting the site on to the abutting
roadway or for the functioning of the intersection of an existing street
and proposed street or access drive.
J. An agreement between the Borough and the developer shall be
provided with regard to operating expenses and maintenance of
proposed traffic signals.
K. Additional through lanes and lane transitions of sufficient length shall
be provided along all abutting streets to allow smooth traffic flow from
the proposed streets and/or access drives to existing traffic lanes, thus
minimizing congestion, delays and or blockage of through traffic within
the proposed improvement area. The design and length should be
justified and supported by the queuing analysis required as part of the
traffic study.
L. Sidewalks shall be provided along the property frontage and within the
development.
1. Sanitary Sewage Disposal. The applicant shall provide publicly owned
sanitary sewage disposal to each lot consistent with the Borough of
Elizabethtown Sewer Connection Ordinance, No. 683, as amended.
2. When the Borough Council, in accordance with the Pennsylvania
Sewage Facilities Act, Act 537, as amended, determines the necessity
for a sewer facilities plan revision (plan revision module for land
development), or supplement, the Council shall require that notice of
approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection be submitted as a condition of final plan approval.
3. Water Supply. The applicant shall provide publicly owned water supply
to each lot consistent with Chapter 26, Water, and with the regulations,
requirements, and design standards of EAWA. The applicant shall
provide evidence that EAWA has approved any water system extension
and that the applicant has provided EAWA financial security to secure
the completion of any water system extension.

§ 616. Dedication of Park and Recreation Land. [Ord. 863, 10/20/
2005, § 1]
All residential subdivisions and land developments shall be provided with
park and recreation land which shall be dedicated to the Borough. The
developer may request that the Borough not require the dedication of
land, and any such request shall be accompanied by an offer to pay a
fee in lieu of dedication of the land, computed in accordance with the
regulations provided herein, an offer to construct recreational facilities and/
or an offer to privately reserve land for park or recreation purposes. All
offers or dedication, payment of fees in lieu of dedication, construction of
recreational facilities, and offers to privately reserve land shall comply with
all of the following criteria:
1. Proposed streets which are in alignment with others already existing
and named shall bear the name of the existing street.
2. In no case shall the name of a proposed street duplicate an existing
street name in the Borough, or in the postal district, irrespective of the
use of the suffix "street," "road," "avenue," "boulevard," "court" and the
like.
3. All street names shall be subject to the approval of Borough Council.
4. Street signs shall be provided at the intersection of all streets by the
applicant. The type, height and design shall be approved by the
Borough Council.
1. Street lights shall be provided with the construction of all new streets.
A plan for street lights, approved by the local utility company, shall be
provided by the applicant upon submission of final subdivision or land
development plans.
2. Street lights shall be provided at locations designated by the local
utility company, consistent with current policy, at all street
intersections and all other locations considered necessary for safety
reasons as approved by Borough Council.
A. The land reserved for park, recreation and open-space usage shall be a
single lot which shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter
relating to the length to depth ratios and which shall be accessible to
the public. No more than 15% of the minimum lot size calculated in this
Section shall consist of floodplain, wetlands, or other features which
shall render the land undevelopable. Areas of floodplain, wetlands, or
other features which shall render the land undevelopable may be
included within the open space lot if such land is above the minimum
area required. No stormwater management facilities designed to retain
or detain water from other portions of the development shall be
§ 614 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 616
FWD:552
permitted on such land reserved for park, recreation and open space
usage.
B. A minimum of 0.25 acre of land shall be reserved as park or
recreational land for each residential lot created in a subdivision or
each dwelling unit created in a land development. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in all cases the minimum area of land reserved as park and
recreation land shall be equal to the minimum lot size in the district in
which the subdivision or land development is located.
C. The developer may request that Council permit the provision of park
and recreation land other than through public dedication of land as set
forth above. The developer shall set forth, in writing, the means by
which he will fulfill this requirement which may include the payment of
a fee in lieu of dedication of all or a portion of the amount of land
required to be dedicated, construction of recreational facilities, the
private reservation of land, or any combination of dedication, fees,
construction of recreational facilities, or private reservation.
D. When so requested by the developer, the Borough may accept a fee in
lieu of dedication because size, shape, location, access, topography or
other physical features render it impractical for the developer to
dedicate land for recreational areas as required by this Section. Such
fee in lieu of payments shall be payable to the Borough prior to the
recording of each final phase of the plan, based on each phase's
percentage of the total number of dwelling units.
(1) If the developer proposes a fee in lieu of dedication, said fee shall
be computed and paid in accordance with policies adopted by
Council. The amount of a fee in lieu payment shall be fair market
value of the land required to be dedicated under § 616(B) above.
The developer shall provide the Borough with all information
necessary to determine fair market value of the land, including, but
not limited to, a copy of the agreement of sale or real estate
transfer tax affidavit of value if the developer is equitable owner or
has purchased the land within the past two years or an appraisal of
the property by an MAI appraiser acceptable to the Borough. Fair
market value shall be computed by dividing the total price of the
tract by the number of acres within the tract and then multiplying
that number by the amount of land required to be dedicated. At the
option of the developer, the developer may elect to pay the per lot
or dwelling unit fee in lieu of dedication established by resolution of
Council.
(2) Any developer who feels aggrieved by the price established by the
Borough shall have the right to secure a second appraisal of the
property by an MAI appraiser acceptable to the Borough. The two
prices shall be averaged, with the result being the amount owed
being what the developer shall be required to pay.

All subdivisions or land developments containing 50 or more dwelling units
or nonresidential buildings containing 20,000 or greater square feet of
gross floor area shall be provided with at least two separate and distinct
means of access for the subdivision or land development.
(3) Fee in Lieu Funds Disposition. Monies received from developers
shall be placed in a capital reserve fund. Fees received from
developers shall be administered and expended as required and
authorized by the MPC.
E. If the developer proposes to construct recreational facilities, the
developer shall present a sketch plan of such facilities and an estimate
of the cost of construction.
F. If the developer proposes the private reservation of land, the developer
shall provide for the maintenance of such land through either the
inclusion of such land as common elements of a condominium or the
creation of a home-owners' association. Such documentation shall be
recorded, shall provide that the land cannot be further developed and
shall give the Borough the rights to maintain the land as set forth in
MPC Article VII dealing with the maintenance of common open space in
planned residential developments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
developer may request that the Borough approve transfer of the land to
an organization dedicated to the conservation of natural resources with
deed restrictions preventing further development acceptable to the
Borough Solicitor.
G. The developer shall enter into an agreement with the Borough setting
for the fees to be paid, the facilities to be constructed or the land to be
privately reserved and the method of its maintenance. All such
agreements shall be in a form satisfactory to the Borough Solicitor.
A. Access may be provided through the location of two or more public or
private streets, each of which intersects with an existing public street.
Such public or private streets shall meet all the requirements of this
Chapter concerning design and construction.
B. Access for a land development may be provided through two or more
driveways into the land development. Such driveways shall be
separated by a distance of at least 150 feet and shall comply with all
requirements of this Chapter.
C. If the applicant is unable to provide access to the subdivision or land
development through two or more public or private streets, each of
which intersects with an existing public street, or two or more
driveways which intersect with one or more existing public streets, an
emergency access shall be provided.

FWD:554
(1) The emergency access shall be improved so that emergency
vehicles may safely transverse it and shall be indicated on the
plans.
(2) The emergency access shall be accessible to the providers of
emergency services within the Borough. Applicants proposing to
provide emergency access shall submit evidence of such approval.
(3) The emergency access may be located so that access to the
subdivision or land development is gained from a public street at a
location unsuitable for regular access with an existing public
street.
(4) The emergency access may be located so that access is gained from
an adjacent tract. For example, a subdivision or land development
adjoining a parking lot of another use may provide emergency
access through a point with a break chain. Applicants with plans
indicating emergency access through an adjoining private tract
shall provide evidence that the adjoining property owner has
consented to such emergency access location.

SOLAR ACCESS PROVISIONS
§ 701. General Statement. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985, § 701]
In an effort to promote energy efficient subdivision and land development
techniques that facilitate the use of alternative renewable energy sources
such as solar energy and to reduce the dependence on nonrenewable
energy sources, the Borough Council herein offers an alternative to the
standard subdivision and land development provisions contained in this
Chapter.
§ 702. Definitions. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985, § 702]
BUILDING ORIENTATION  Refers to the relationship of a building's
longest axis to true south. Optimal building orientation occurs when the
building's longest axis is east to west (90° from true south), with variations
of up to 25° from the east/west axis being acceptable.
SHADOW ANALYSIS  A graphic representation of shadows cast by mature
landscaping, screening, and structures plotted with regard to topography,
slope, and direction at 9:00 a.m., noon, and 3:00 p.m. on the date of the
winter solstice.
SOLAR ENERGY  Radiant energy (direct, diffuse or reflected) received
from the sun at wavelengths suitable for conversion into thermal, chemical,
or electrical energy.
SOLAR ENERGY COLLECTOR  Any device, structure or part of a device
or structure which is used primarily to transform solar energy into thermal,
chemical, or electrical energy, including any space or structural component
specifically designed to retain heat derived from solar energy.
SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM  A complete design or assembly consisting of
a solar energy collector, an energy storage facility (where appropriate) and
components for the distribution of transformed energy to the extent that
they cannot be used jointly with a conventional energy system. Passive
solar energy systems which use the natural properties of materials and
architectural components to collect and store solar energy without using
any external mechanical power are included in this definition if they do not
fulfill structural or other functions.
SOLAR-ORIENTED PLAN  A subdivision or land development plan as
defined in Part 2 of this Chapter with a minimum of 25% of all lots or
structures oriented for solar access purposes as specified in § 703(1) of this
Chapter.
SOLAR SKYSPACE  The space between a given location and the sun which
must remain unobstructed between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. mean solar time
on the date of the winter solstice in order to permit sufficient solar energy
to impinge on that location to allow efficient solar utilization.
SOLAR SKYSPACE EASEMENT  A right, expressed as an easement,
covenant or condition or other property interest in any deed or other
§ 701 FOREWORD § 702
FWD:557
instrument executed by or on behalf of any landlord which protects the solar
sky space of an actual, proposed or designated solar energy collector at
a described location by forbidding or limiting activities or land uses that
interfere with access to solar energy. The solar skyspace may be described
as a three-dimensional space in which an obstruction is prohibited or
limited, or as the times of day during which direct sunlight to the solar
energy collector may not be obstructed, or as a combination of the two
methods.
§ 703. Plan Processing Procedures. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985, § 703]
§ 704. Plan Requirements. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985, § 704]

§ 706. Design Standards. [Ord. 663, 6/20/1985, § 706]
The same standards shall be required of a solar-oriented plan as specified
in Part six of this Chapter with the following provisions being included as
additional standards for the solar-oriented portion, or portions, of the plan:
E. A shadow analysis showing the location of existing trees and new
trees and screening, and shadows cast by proposed structures and
nature landscaping at 9:00 a.m., noon, and 3:00 p.m. on the date of
the winter solstice. Shadows shall be plotted with regard to
topography, slope and direction.
F. The Borough Council may require the submission of additional data
as necessary to assure that adequate provision has been made in
the planning and design of the subdivision or land development to
enable the maximum effective use of solar energy systems.
3. Final Plan. The same standards shall be required of a solar-oriented
plan as specified in § 404 of this Chapter with the additional information
listed below also being required to be shown on the plan:
A. True north arrow.
B. Delineation of solar skyspace easements and open space areas
required to remain undeveloped to protect solar access to building
sites.
C. As a condition of final plan approval, the applicant may be required
to provide solar skyspace easements or restrictive covenants with
deeds of the lots in a subdivision or buildings in a land development
to guarantee solar access protection.
A. Insofar as possible, streets on which structures are proposed to front
shall be oriented along an east-west axis with maximum deviations
permitted up to 25°; provided that such orientations are feasible based
on soil and slope conditions and are a practical means of providing safe
and convenient access and circulation.
B. Side lot lines shall, so far as practical, run from due north to south
where the resulting angle of incidence with the street is not less than
30°. A variation of up to 25° east or west of the north/south axis is
permitted.
C. Buildings shall be oriented such that their longest axis faces within 25°
of true south whenever lot size, street orientation, soil, and slope
conditions make this practical.
§ 704 FOREWORD § 706
FWD:559
D. Solar skyspace easements shall be in writing and shall be subject to the
same conveyancing and instrument recording requirements as other
easements. Any such easements shall be appurtenant; shall run with
the land benefited and burdened; and shall be defined and limited by
conditions stated in the instrument of conveyance. Instruments
creating a solar skyplace easement shall include but not be limited to:
(1) A permanently identifiable description of the skyspace above the
burdened land into which trees, buildings and/or other obstruction
as specified by the easement shall not be permitted to encroach;
(2) Any terms or conditions under which the solar skyspace easement
is granted or will be terminated; and,
(3) Any provision for compensation by the owner of the land benefiting
from the solar skyspace easement, or compensation of the owner of
the land burdened by the solar skyspace easement for maintaining
the easement.
E. The installation of all improvements shall, within the limits of
practicability and feasibility, be oriented to maximize the solar access to
buildings constructed thereon.
F. Where recreation space is being provided, it shall be located in such a
manner that allows maximum practical solar access to neighboring
structures.
G. The location and species of trees and other landscaping elements shall
be such that when grown to full maturity shall not impede solar access
to neighboring structures.
H. Where open space in being provided, it shall be located, wherever
possible, to provide a buffer from the shading effects of taller structures
or obstructions on existing or proposed shorter buildings.
I. Landscaping shall be designed, installed, and maintained with the aim
of allowing as great a portion of the site to remain or become wooded
without adversely affecting the availability of solar access to the south.
Whenever conflicting provisions prevail, the Borough Council, upon
recommendation of the Borough Planning Commission, will determine
which standard will be adhered to in each such instance.

§ 204. Exemption from Tax for Individuals Under Age 16. [Ord. 801,
12/16/1999; as amended by Ord. 930, 10/20/2011]

sanction, been considered as comprising separate classes for any
legislative purposes; and
B. Minors under the age of 16 are generally unemancipated and
subject to compulsory school attendance and child labor laws and
therefore have limited earned income and net profits and control of
money such that enforcement of reporting and collection of the tax
hereunder against them would yield inconsequential amounts and
be unduly difficult, expensive and not in the public interest.

§ 403. Local Water Rationing Plan. [Ord. 694, 1/19/1989, § 3; as
amended by Ord. 829, 11/15/2001]
1. Purpose. This local water rationing plan is intended to establish
measures for essential conservation of water resources, and to provide
for equitable distribution of limited water supplies, in order to balance
demand and limited available supplies and to assure that sufficient
water is available to preserve public health and safety within the
service area of the Borough of Elizabethtown in the event of a drought
emergency as established by the Governor's office.
2. Authority. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management is authorized to
promulgate, adopt and enforce a water rationing plan by virtue of
Emergency Management Services Code 35, Pa.C.S. 7101 et seq., as
implemented by the Drought Emergency Proclamation dated.
3. Definitions.
BOROUGH  The Borough of Elizabethtown.
EMERGENCY SERVICE AREA  The service area of the Borough of
Elizabethtown.
EXCESS USE  The usage of water by a water customer in excess of
the water allotment provided under the local water rationing plan for
that customer, over any applicable period.
NONRESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER  Commercial, industrial,
institutional, public and all other users with the exception of hospitals
and health care facilities.
RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER  Any customer who receives water
services for a single or multi-family dwelling unit. The term "residential
customer" does not include educational or other institutions, hotels,
motels or similar commercial establishments.
SERVICE AREA  The territory and the customers serviced by the
Borough of Elizabethtown.
SERVICE INTERRUPTION  The temporary suspension of water
supply, or reduction of pressures below that are required for adequate
supply to any customer, portion of a water supply system or any entire
system.
§ 402 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 403
FWD:624
SPECIAL EMERGENCY AREA  The area or areas within which the
Governor has declared a state of drought and water shortage
emergency.
WATER ALLOTMENT  The maximum quantity of water allowed for
each customer over any applicable period as established pursuant to
this Plan.
WATER CUSTOMER  Any person who is connected to and receives
water service from the Borough of Elizabethtown.
4. Scope. This local Water Rationing Plan shall apply to all water uses
within the service area of the Borough of Elizabethtown, encompassing
all or part of the Borough of Elizabethtown, Mount Joy Township, and
West Donegal Township.
5. Objective of the Plan.
A. It is imperative that water customers within the Emergency Service
Area achieve an immediate and further reduction in the water use
in order to extend existing water supplies and, at the same time,
assure that sufficient water is available to preserve the public
health and sanitation and provide fire protection service.
B. The objective of this local water rationing plan is to effect an
immediate 25% reduction in water usage.
C. The immediate 25% reduction in water usage is another step along
a continuum of responses to the present water supply crisis. Should
drought conditions continue, further reductions in usage may be
required. It must be emphasized that the 25% usage reduction in
the emergency area is a valid and attainable figure reflective of the
conditions which currently exist.
D. The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage, and for
equal sacrifice on the part of each water customer. The success of
this plan depends on the cooperation of all water customers in the
emergency service area.
6. Prohibited Nonessential Water Uses. The following water uses are
declared nonessential and are prohibited within the Emergency Service
Area.
A. The watering of lawns.
B. The watering of outdoor gardens, landscaped areas, trees, shrubs,
and other outdoor plants, except between the hours of 5:00 p.m.
and 9:00 a.m. by means of a bucket, or pail, at the minimum rate
necessary.
C. The washing of automobiles and trucks except when required for
safety and operational purposes.
D. The washing of streets, driveways and sidewalks.
§ 403 FOREWORD § 403
FWD:625
E. The serving of water in restaurants, clubs or eating places unless
specifically requested by the individual.
F. Ornamental water use, including but not limited to, fountains,
artificial water-falls and reflecting pools.

or any public or private individual or entity except as deemed
necessary and approved in the interest of public health or safety by
the municipal health officials.
H. The use of fire hydrants by fire companies for testing fire apparatus
and for fire department drills except as deemed necessary in the
interest of public safety and specifically approved by the Borough
of Elizabethtown.
I. The use of fire hydrants by Borough road departments, contractors
and all others, except as necessary for fire fighting or protection
purposes.
J. The use of water to fill and top off swimming pools.
7. General Requirement for Water Use Reductions. Each and every water
customer, regardless of whether residential, commercial, industrial,
municipal, institutional or other type of user, shall achieve the water
use reductions set forth in this local water rationing plan. In order to
achieve the overall objectives of the Plan, the water use restrictions and
limitations set forth in §§ 7-9 shall apply.
8. Water Use Restrictions for Residential Users.
A. Metered Residential Water Customers and Allotments.
(1) The number of permanent residents in each dwelling unit
(household) will determine the amount of water that each
household will be allowed.
(2) Each dwelling unit (household) shall be allotted 40 gallons per
day for each resident of the household. Households with only
one permanent resident will have a daily allotment of 55
gallons.
(3) Residential water customers are required to provide Borough
personnel with reasonable access to read meters as necessary
to implement this rationing plan. Where access is not readily
available, the Borough shall make all reasonable efforts to
contact customers in order to arrange for access to read
meters. In the event a water customer does not allow Borough
personal entry to read the meter, after the Borough has made
reasonable efforts to arrange for such access, the dwelling unit
(house-hold) allotment will be reduced to 55 gallons per day.
B. Exemptions and Variances.
§ 403 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 403
FWD:626
(1) Where the residential water allotment provided under this
§ 303 would create extraordinary hardship, as in the case of
special health-related requirements, the water customer may
apply to the Borough for any exemption or variance from these
requirements. If the Borough finds that the allotment provided
in this § 303 would impose extraordinary hardship, the
Borough may establish a revised allotment for the particular
customer.
(2) Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an
exemption or variance rendered by the Borough may file an
appeal with the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas in
accordance with the provisions and procedures of the Local
Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 551-555, §§ 751-754.
C. Suggested Conservation Measures. The Borough will provide
residential water customers with suggested means for reducing
water consumption in order to achieve the established allotment.
These suggestions may include:
(1) Locate and repair all leaks in faucets, toilets and water-using
appliances.
(2) Adjust all water-using appliances to use the minimum amount
of water in order to achieve the appliance's purpose.
(3) Use automatic washing machines and dishwashers only with
full loads. Preferably, wash dishes by hand.
(4) Take shorter showers and shallower baths.
(5) Turn off shower while soaping; turn off faucet while brushing
teeth, etc.
(6) Install flow restrictors in showerheads and faucets.
(7) Reduce the number of toilet flushes per day. Each flush uses
about five gallons. Reduce water used per flush by installing
toilet tank displacement inserts.
(8) Use sink and tub stoppers to avoid wasting water.
(9) Keep bottle of chilled drinking water in refrigerator.
(10) Read the meter to determine the household's daily water use.
9. Water Use Restrictions for Nonresidential Water Customers.
A. Nonresidential customers include commercial, industrial,
institutional, public and all other users, with the exception of
hospitals and health care facilities.
§ 403 FOREWORD § 403
FWD:627
B. Nonresidential water customers shall reduce their water usage by
a minimum of 25% of use levels for the same quarter of the
preceding year.
C. It is the primary responsibility of each nonresidential water
customer to meet its mandated water use reduction goal in
whatever manner possible.
D. The Borough will establish a water allotment for each
nonresidential water customer, based upon a required 25%
reduction of water usage from the rate of water used by the
customer in the same quarter of the preceding year of the last
recorded use level if no meter readings record the rate of the
customer's use in the same quarter of the preceding year.
E. Each nonresidential water user shall provide access to Borough
personnel for purposes of meter reading and monitoring of
compliance with this plan. The Borough shall make all reasonable
efforts to contact customers to arrange for access.
F. If the mandated 25% reduction in water usage cannot be obtained
without imposing extraordinary hardship threatening health and
safety, the nonresidential customer may apply to the Borough of
Elizabethtown for a variance. For these purposes, "extraordinary
hardship" means a permanent damage to property or economic loss
which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by
other water users subject to this water rationing plan. If the
Borough finds that the 25% reduction would cause extraordinary
hardship or threaten health or safety, the Borough may grant a
variance and establish a revised water use reduction requirement
for the particular customer.
G. Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such a variance
rendered by the Borough may appeal the decision to the
Commonwealth Drought Coordinator who shall render a final
decision.
H. The Borough of Elizabethtown will supply each nonresidential
customer with suggested means to reduce usage levels. These
suggestions may include:
(1) Identify and repair all leaky fixtures and water-using
equipment. Special attention is to be given to equipment
connected directly to the water line, such as processing air
conditioners and furnaces.
(2) Assure that the valves and solenoids, which control water
flows, are shut off completing when the water-using cycle is
not engaged.
(3) Adjust water-using equipment to use the minimum amount of
water required to achieve its stated purpose.
§ 403 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 403
FWD:628
(4) Shorten rinse cycles for laundry machines as much as possible;
lower water levels should be implemented wherever possible.
(5) Temperature settings of hot water for showers should be set
down at least 10° to discourage lengthy shower taking.
(6) Where plumbing fixtures can accommodate them, flow
restricting or other water-saving devices should be installed.
(7) Review usage patterns to see where other savings can be
made.
(8) For processing and cooling and other uses where possible,
either reuse water or use from sources that would not
adversely affect public water supplies.
(9) Advise employees, students, patients, customers and other
users not to flush toilets after every use. Install toilet tank
displacement inserts; place flow restrictors in showerheads
and faucets; close down automatic flushes overnight.
(10) Adjust flushometers and automatic flushing valves to use as
little water as possible or to cycle at greater intervals.
(11) Encourage water-consciousness by placing water-saving
posters and literature where employees, students, patients and
customers, etc., will have access to them.
I. Customers should read water meters on a frequent basis to
determine consumption patterns.
10. Water Use Restrictions for Hospitals and Health Care Facilities.
A. Hospitals and health care facilities shall comply with all restrictions
imposed on residential and nonresidential water customers as may
be applicable to each individual institution, to the extent
compliance will not endanger the health of the patients or residents
of the institution.
B. Each hospital and health care facility shall survey its water usage
patterns and requirements and implement such additional
conservation measures as may be possible without endangering the
health of patients or residents to achieve a 25% reduction in the
institution's water usage.
C. The Borough will provide each hospital and health care facility with
suggested means to reduce usage levels. These suggestions may
include:
(1) Reduce laundry usage or services by changing bed linen, etc.,
only where necessary to preserve the health of patients or
residents.
(2) Use disposable food service items.
§ 403 FOREWORD § 403
FWD:629
(3) Eliminate, postpone or reduce, as may be appropriate, elective
surgical procedures during the period of the emergency.
11. Enforcement of Water-Rationing Plan.
A. The Borough of Elizabethtown will have lead responsibility for the
monitoring of compliance with this water rationing plan.
B. The following provisions shall govern the implementation of
temporary service interruptions:
(1) In order to effectuate compliance with this plan, the Borough
of Elizabethtown is hereby authorized and required to plan and
implement temporary service interruptions to all or part of its
water supply system, as the Borough may deem appropriate,
when any and/or all of the following conditions are determined
by the Borough to exist, as to its water supply system:
(a) A 25% reduction in systemwide water usage has not been
achieved; and/or,
(b) The 25% reduction in systemwide water usage has been
achieved, but has failed to have a significant impact in
extending limited water supplies; and/or,
(c) Temporary service interruptions are necessary in order to
further extend limited and/or dwindling water supplies.
(2) In the event that the Borough determines that temporary
service interruptions are necessary, the Borough shall notify its
customers through the public media (newspaper, radio,
telephone, and television), at least one day prior to the
temporary service interruptions, that a planned, temporary
service interruption is to be imposed.
In addition, the Borough shall notify the Commonwealth
Drought Coordinator, the local coordinator of emergency
management, local public health authorities, the Pennsylvania
Emergency Management Agency, and the regional office of
the Department of Environmental Protection. Such notice
shall:
(a) State the day or days when the planned, temporary service
interruptions will occur;
(b) State the time(s) when such planned, temporary service
interruptions will commence, and the time(s) such
interruptions will cease;
(c) State whether the planned, temporary service
interruptions are to be imposed on the entire system, or a
part thereof, and, if only part(s) of the system will
experience planned, temporary service interruptions,
§ 403 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 403
FWD:630
identify the geographical boundaries within which
planned, temporary service interruptions will occur;
(d) Advise all customers within the areas affected by planned,
temporary service interruptions how to treat any water
received from the system, for human consumption, during
the period(s) of planned, temporary service interruptions
and for such additional time as may be necessary until full
pressure is restored to the system.
(3) If the Borough imposes planned, temporary service
interruptions as authorized and required by this Plan, it must
provide for the continued delivery of water to health care
facilities within the area(s) affected by such interruptions, by
means of adequate, alternative delivery measures that may be
necessary.
(4) If the Borough implements planned, temporary service
interpretations, it must make provisions, by any means
possible, for the continued delivery of such water, as may be
necessary, for the proper operation of sewage collection,
treatment and disposal systems and facilities.
C. Any residential or nonresidential water customer who exceeds the
allotments established pursuant to this Water Rationing Plan will
be subject to the following excess-use charge.
(1) The Borough of Elizabethtown is directed to collect an "excess

exceeds the water allotments established pursuant to the Local
Water Rationing Plan, computed in accordance with the
following schedule:
Excess Usage Per Month Charge for Excess
First 2,000 gallons or portions
thereof
$7 per 1,000 gallons or

charges shall not be accounted for as income to the Borough
but shall be placed by the Borough in a reserve account. Funds
collected shall be disposed of in accordance with the directions
of the Commonwealth Drought Coordinator.
D. In addition to the excess-use, noncompliance with the Water
Rationing Plan will result in the following:

shall be issued to the customer by the Borough.
§ 403 FOREWORD § 403
FWD:631
(2) For the second or subsequent excess use, the Borough may
interrupt or shut-off service to the customer for a period not to
exceed 48 hours, or, if the customer provides access, the
Borough may install a flow restriction in the customer's service
line for the duration of the emergency. The cost incurred by the
Borough to interrupt or shut-off and reinstate service, or to
install and remove a flow restrictor, shall be assessed to the
water customer by the Borough.
E. The Borough of Elizabethtown is authorized to alter meter reading
schedules to assure adequate monitoring of compliance with this
Plan.
F. Any customer or other person aggrieved by a decision or action by
the Borough imposing an excess-use charge or other remedy for
noncompliance with the requirements of this Plan may proceed in
accordance with the following provisions:

3. Handling of Material. Pipe shall be so handled that the coating and
lining is not damaged. If any part of the coating or lining is damaged,
the repair shall be made by the contractor at his or her expense and to
the satisfaction of the Borough. Valves and hydrants shall be stored and
kept dry before installation. Any material that is dropped during
handling is subject to rejection regardless of its apparent condition.
4. Alignment and Grade. Where the proposed pipeline route is on a curve,
the contractor may deflect the pipe at the joints to published
manufacturer tolerances. Where underground conditions require a
change of alignment or grade, such change shall be made only with the
written consent of the Borough. When a change in grade is indicated
which will result in the pipe having more cover than originally
anticipated, the class of pipe installed at the location shall withstand
the new loadings. Except at predesignated points, no high points shall
be established where air can accumulate. If field conditions necessitate
a change in the pipe profile and, in the opinion of the Borough, the
change requires the installation of a fire hydrant, the contractor shall
install the same.

of its barrel, with recesses excavated to accommodate bells and
joints. Each pipe shall be firmly held in position so that the invert
forms a continuous grade with the invert of the pipe previously
placed.
C. Under no conditions shall pipe be laid in water, on subgrade
containing frost, and/or when trench conditions are unsuitable for
such work. In all cases, water shall be kept out of the trench until
concrete cradles, supports, encasement or saddles, where used,
and materials in the joints have hardened.
D. Any pipe that has its grade or joint disturbed after laying shall be
taken up and relaid. Any section of pipe already laid and found to
be defective shall be taken up and replaced with new pipe without
expenses to the owner.
E. Walking or working on top of the completed pipeline, except as may
be necessary in backfilling or tamping, shall not be permitted until
the trench has been backfilled to a height of at least two feet over
the top of the pipeline.
F. At times when pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of the
pipe shall be closed by watertight plug.
G. All joints shall be made in accordance with the pipe supplier's
specifications and in accordance with the following instructions:

notice of the pending interruption of service. If the number of
customers and length of interruption are such, in the opinion of
the owner, to justify the need, the contractor shall place
advertisements in the local newspaper a minimum of three
times, prior to the scheduled interruption of service. The cost
of such advertising shall be included in the price bid for the
various connections.
B. Schedule of Work. The contractor shall follow the installation
schedule as outlined below:
(1) In locations where new water mains are to be connected to
existing water mains, the contractor will not be permitted to
proceed with the construction of the connection until he has
dug test pits and determined the exact location, elevation and
type of existing pipe and its outside diameter. The contractor is
reminded that old water main pipe may vary in roundness and
outside diameter and consider this factor in ordering materials
for the connection. The cost of excavating, maintaining, and
backfilling test pits shall be considered incidental to the earth
excavation and backfill, and no separate payment will be made.
Pits shall be protected and backfilled, if required, by the
contractor.
(2) If the condition of the connection is regulated by geometry, as
determined by data obtained from the excavation of the test

FWD:668
pits, the contractor shall order any necessary additional
materials.
(3) The contractor shall notify the owner at least five days in
advance of the time he or she proposes to install the
connection, and shall establish with the owner the procedures
to be followed in installing the connection, including the day
and time of the proposed shutdown, and establish a new date
and time for the shutdown, based on the owner's knowledge of
system conditions. The contractor is hereby warned that the
owner reserves the right to require that any particular
connection be made at night or on a Sunday.
(4) Before the start of the installation of a connection, the
contractor shall do as much work in advance as possible prior
to actually shutting down the main, and shall have all
necessary tools, equipment, materials and labor on hand at the
start of the work.
(5) Once the existing main is cut, work shall be continuous until
water service is restored.
(6) When installing connections, estrained joints and tie rods and
clamps shall be used to the maximum extent possible, in lieu of
concrete thrust blocks when installing connections, unless
shown otherwise on the drawings. If it is necessary to use
concrete thrust blocks, the high early strength cement
concrete shall be used.
12. Service Lines.
A. General. The sizing of customer service lines shall be subject to
Borough approval and shall be based on the length of line and the
water demand. Residential service lines shall normally be 3/4
inches in size. The service line shall normally consist of a
corporation stop, copper pipe, curb stop and box.
B. Materials.

minimum cover of four feet. Curb stops shall be vertical, with
the top of the curb box a finished grade. Where grading may be
still in progress, the curb box shall be marked by a high stake.
(2) Where service lines cross highways or streets, a 1 1/4 inch (for
3/4-inch service pipe) black steel casing pipe shall be installed
across the street by boring, jacking, auguring or drilling, and
the service line shall be inserted in the casing pipe. If
underground conditions do not permit boring, pushing, or
jacking, the contractor shall obtain authority approval before
proceeding with an alternate method of installation. PennDOT
normally requires that water mains crossing State highways be
installed in a casing pipe which shall be bored, jacked or
augured under the highway, as specified in § 616, "Special
Crossings." However, PennDOT may permit the open cutting of
trenches across State highways as specified in § 616.

PVC pipe as specified herein. The PVC pipe shall extend a minimum
distance of 20 feet from the crossing pipe on each side. The PVC pipe
shall be suitable for direct connection to cast iron or ductile iron pipe,
and shall conform to AWWA C900. The PVC pipe shall be Johns-Manville
Blue-Brute Thickwall Ring-Tite PVC water pipe or approved equal.
16. Reaction Backings. Concrete reaction backings shall be provided for all
tees, crosses, and bends, both horizontal and vertical. Concrete shall be
Class A in accordance with PennDOT Form 408. Reaction backings shall
be designed for 175 psi minimum; contractor shall submit design for
approval.
§ 614 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 615
FWD:670
1. General.
A. This section covers the testing and disinfection of the water mains.
The contractor shall prepare a schedule and procedure for the
testing and disinfection of the different parts of the work and shall
submit the same to the Borough for approval two weeks before
beginning the testing and disinfection. The contractor shall
perform the testing and disinfection prompt and efficiently without
interference to the system operation. The contractor shall give the
Borough 24 hours notice before testing any main.
B. The contractor shall begin testing and disinfection of the various
sections of water mains promptly upon the completion of a section
of work, unless the Borough approves otherwise. The Borough
reserves the right to limit the amount of water main to be tested.
The contractor shall close the section of water main to be tested by
valves or temporary plugs and shall install temporary reaction
backings where required.
2. Hydrostatic and Leakage Test.
A. Hydrostatic pressure tests shall not be made until at least seven
days after concrete reaction backings are installed. The contractor,
at his option and expense, may use high early strength cement
concrete for reaction backings, in which case hydrostatic pressure
tests shall not be made until at least three days have elapsed.
B. The contractor shall completely backfill the trench, or may partially
backfill the trench with written approval of the Borough, prior to
carrying out the pressure test.
C. The section of water main being tested shall be filled with water a
minimum of 48 hours before the main is tested. The contractor
shall insure that air is expelled from the pipeline in accordance
with AWWA C600, § 4.1.3. Any taps necessary to release air or
water from the main during testing shall be made at the
contractor's expense, unless retained by the owner for other use.
D. After the pipeline has been filled with water for 48 hours, the
contractor shall conduct a hydrostatic or pressure test. The
duration of the pressure test shall be at least two hours. Each
section of water main shall be tested under the design pressure
specified in § 611(2)(C)(2), measured at the low point of the section
of main being tested. The proposed test pressure shall be approved
by the Borough prior to testing, and the contractor shall not employ
a test pressure which exceeds the allowable pressure of any
installed pipe, valve or appurtenance.
E. In order to successfully pass the pressure test the line or section of
line being tested cannot lose any pressure during the two hour test.
3. Disinfection.
§ 615 FOREWORD § 615
FWD:671
A. General. Before being placed in service, all pipe installed under
this contract shall be disinfected by chlorination in accordance with
AWWA C60 1, except where specified otherwise in this Section.
B. Preliminary Flushing. Prior to disinfection, the sections of pipeline
being disinfected shall be flushed thoroughly. If necessary, the line
shall be opened up to flush as in a case where no hydrants are
available.
C. Form of Chlorine for Disinfection. The contractor shall use either
liquid chlorine or calcium hypochlorite solution for disinfection in
accordance with AWWA C601, § 6.
(1) Liquid Chlorine. A chlorine-gas water mixture shall be applied
by means of a solution feed chlorinating device in combination
with a booster pump for injecting the chlorine gas-water
mixture into the main to be disinfected. This method shall be
used only if the contractor can demonstrate to the Engineer
that the person supervising the operation is thoroughly
familiar with and experienced in the handling of chlorine gas,
and that the equipment to be used is suitable, and that proper
safety equipment is available.
(2) Calcium Hypochlorite Solution. A chlorine-water solution of 1%
available chlorine shall be prepared, using granular calcium
hypochlorite, and this solution shall then be injected or
pumped into the pipeline. A chlorine water solution of 1%
available chlorine may be prepared by mixing approximately
one pound of calcium hypochlorite with 8.5 gallons of water.
D. Application of Chlorine. The hypochlorite solution shall be allied to
the water main with a gasoline or electrically-pod chemical feed
pump, designed for feeding chlorine solutions. For smaller
applications, the solution may be prepared in a barrel, and then
pumped into the main with a hand pump, such as a hydraulic test
pump. The dosage rate shall be such that the chlorine
concentration in the water in the pipe is a minimum of 50 p.p.m.
available chlorine. The following table gives the amount of calcium
hypochlorite and the quantity of 1% hypochlorite solution required
to produce a 50 p.p.m. chlorine concentration in 100 feet of pipe:

16 139.60 8725 1044 10 0.621 5.22
E. Point of Application. The point of application of the chlorinating
agent shall be at the high end of the pipeline section, and through a
corporation stop inserted in the top of the new pipe. If the water for
the preparation of the chlorine solution is supplied from a tap on
the existing pipeline, there shall be a physical break between the
injector supply and the injector pump.
F. Rate of application. The chlorine solution shall be pumped slowly
into the new pipeline. Chlorine application shall not cease until the
entire main is filled with the chlorine solution. If required by the
Engineer, the chlorine residual shall be measured at several points
along the section of main being tested to insure that the proper
dosage and distribution of the chlorine solution is obtained.
G. Prevention of Reverse Flow. Great care shall be exercised in
manipulating valves, so that the strong chlorine solution in the line
being treated will not flow back into the adjoining water
distribution system.
H. Retention Period and Chlorine Concentration. The chlorinated
water shall be retained in the main for at least 24 hours, during
which time all valves and hydrants in the section treated shall be
operated, in order to disinfect the appurtenances. At the end of this
twenty-four-hour period, the treated water shall contain no less
than 25 p.p.m. chlorine throughout the length of the main. Should
the initial procedure fail to result in the conditions specified, the
chlorination procedure shall be repeated until such results are
obtained, at the contractor's expense.
I. Point of Discharge. The contractor shall discharge the disinfecting
solution from the mains through available outlets, or through taps
in the main. The contractor shall exercise all due precautions in
discharging the chlorine bearing water; since it is extremely toxic
and, if allowed to flow into streams, can readily destroy aquatic life.
§ 615 FOREWORD § 615
FWD:673
If any damage to property or fish life occurs due to the disposal of
the disinfecting solution, the cost of the damage shall be paid by
the contractor. If the possibility of damage to aquatic life is such, in
the opinion of the Engineer, that special precautions are required,
the contractor shall dechlorinate the disinfecting solution before it
goes to waste. The chlorine solution may be neutralized by applying
sodium thiosulfate in the ratio of two parts thiosulfate to one part
chlorine at the point of discharge. Contractor shall comply with
Lancaster County Soil Conservation District requirements.
J. Final Flushing. Following chlorination, the heavily chlorinated
water shall be thoroughly flushed from the line at its extremities
until the replacement water throughout its length, upon test, be
proven comparable to the quality of water in the existing
distribution system.
K. Flushing Water. Water for flushing will be provided by the owner,
but at no time shall valves on the water distribution system be
operated without the presence of a duly qualified representative of
the owner.
L. Water for Testing. Water will be furnished by the owner for one
hydrostatic test and disinfection procedure. If pipelines must be
retested and disinfected, the cost for additional water will be borne
by the contractor at a cost rate determined by the owner.
4. Disinfection of Water Main Connection. Since it may not be possible to
disinfect the pipe, valves and fittings installed at certain connections in
the manner specified above, the contractor shall proceed as follows:
A. Installation of Connection. Every precaution shall be observed
during the installation of the connection to prevent foreign material
and trench water from entering the pipe, fittings, and valves during
their installation.
B. Disinfection. The interior of all pipe, fittings and valves shall be
swabbed with a 5% hypochlorite solution. A 5% hypochlorite
solution can be obtained by mixing approximately three pounds of
granulated calcium hypochlorite with five gallons of water.
C. Flushing. After the pipe, fittings, and valves have been swabbed,
they shall be thoroughly flushed with water.
5. Disposal of Water.
A. Again, the contractor is reminded that the chlorinated water must
be disposed of in a manner such that no damage occurs to fish life
of vegetation. If the Department of Environmental Protection has
regulations for waste water disposal, it shall be the contractor's
responsibility to follow the regulations to their end. Contractor
shall comply with all Lancaster County Soil Conservation District
requirements.

needs and growth pattern of the Borough of Elizabethtown, where
appropriate, with reference to the adequacy of the site area and the
arrangement of buildings, driveways, parking areas, off-street loading
and unloading spaces, and other pertinent features of the proposal. The

use will not have an impact on either current or future uses in the
immediate vicinity, or the normal conduct of residential or
nonresidential uses.

of the application within which to file its report thereon. In the event
that the Planning Commission shall fail to file its report within 30 days,

exception, and the applicant shall bear the burden of clearly
demonstrating compliance with all of the following standards and
criteria:
(1) The applicant shall demonstrate, through technological
evidence and data, that the proposed location is absolutely
necessary for the operation of the system.
(2) Any stand-alone structure not attached to an existing building
shall be set back from each property line that is adjacent to a
residential use, but in no circumstance less than 50 feet from
any property line or any such building. This setback shall be
applicable to guide wire anchors for the structure. Any
structure shall be provided with warning signage for potential
radiation danger, if any. Shielding shall be installed if there is
any potential radiation.
(3) All commercial communication towers shall be completely
enclosed by an eight-foot-high nonclimbable fence with selflocking
gate.
(4) There shall be no electrical, electromagnetic or microwave or
other interference or pollution off-site.

not be affected by support structure failure, falling ice or other
debris. All support structures shall be fitted with anti-climbing
devices as approved by the manufacturer.
(6) The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna and
commercial communications tower is the minimum height
required to function satisfactorily. This requirement shall not
be applicable to antennas located upon an existing structure
where the total height of the structure and antenna does not
exceed 150 feet.
(7) If the applicant proposes to erect a new commercial
communication tower, the applicant shall demonstrate that he
or she has contacted the owners of nonresidential structures
within a one-mile radius of the proposed site and has requested
permission to install the antenna on those structures. The

§ 1413 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 1413
FWD:800
shall make a good-faith effort to install the antenna on existing
structures, including but not limited to flagpoles, bell towers,
smokestacks, water towers, silos, electrical transmission
facilities, tall commercial or industrial buildings, previously
existing commercial communication towers of other
communication companies and similar structures.
(8) In order to reduce the number of commercial communication
towers needed in the Borough in the future, any new proposed
commercial communication tower shall be designed to
accommodate other users, including but not limited to police,
fire and emergency services. Applicants shall submit an
agreement with the Borough whereby they agree to negotiate
in good faith with subsequent lessees to lease the commercial
communication tower for co-usage.
(9) If the use of the site requires licensing by any State or Federal
agency, the applicant shall present a copy of the application to
such entities and all decisions by such entities.
(10) If the site operation is fully automated, the applicant shall
provide off-street parking required for two maintenance

buildings, which may be installed. Landscaping shall consist of
evergreen trees to be planted on ten-foot centers maximum,
which shall have a minimum height of six feet at the time of
planting. The Board may require further deciduous plantings
to mitigate the impact of the development on the surrounding
neighborhood. All landscaping must be installed prior to the
issuance of the certificate of use and occupancy by the Zoning
Officer. Existing vegetation on and around the site shall be
preserved unless absolutely necessary to be removed for
functioning of the equipment. This requirement shall not be
applicable to antennas located upon an existing structure
where the total height of the structure and antenna does not
exceed 150 feet.
(12) Commercial communication towers shall be painted with paint
such as to significantly reduce the visual impact thereof;
provided, however, these requirements shall not apply to an
antenna which is installed upon an existing structure that is
not exclusively an antenna support structure. Support
structures shall be painted an acceptable color that will lessen
visual impact. Commercial communication towers shall meet
all minimum Federal Aviation Administration regulations. No
§ 1413 FOREWORD § 1413

site(s) shall contain a right-of-way of at least 20 feet, 10 feet of
which shall be improved with a hard surface in compliance
with the driveway requirements of the Borough of
Elizabethtown Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
[Chapter 22].
B. In the case of roof-mounted communication antenna sites, the
following additional criteria shall apply:
(1) Unless communication requirements absolutely require
another location, any roof-mounted antenna site shall be
installed only on that portion of the roof facing the rear of the
property.
(2) No roof-mounted commercial antenna site shall project more
than five feet above the roofline unless the applicant shall
demonstrate that unique site constraints create interference
which mandates a higher placement in order to provide for
proper reception. The applicant shall provide clear and
convincing evidence of the interference which mandate a
higher placement and clear and convincing evidence that the
placement required is the minimum necessary for proper
reception:
(3) If there is any radiation potential, the applicant shall provide
shielding and warning signage.

§ 3; as amended by Ord. 882, 2/15/2007]
Adaptive reuse is a process that adapts a building or a group of buildings
for new uses in order to retain their historical, architectural, and economic
features and provide environmental, social, and economic benefits to the
neighborhood and community. Adaptive reuse applies when 1) the proposed
use of the building or group of buildings does not meet zoning requirements
for the zoning district in which the building or group of buildings is located
and 2) the long-term benefits of the proposed adaptive reuse to the
neighborhood or community of the proposed project outweigh the
alternative of demolition, vacancy or underutilization of the building or
group of buildings. Where permitted, or permitted as a conditional use,
adaptive reuse of a building or group of buildings may occur subject to the
following conditions:
G. Any outside storage or display areas shall not occupy any portion of a
public street or alley, right-of-way, or any other area intended for
vehicular or pedestrian use, required parking areas or required front
yard.

detailed in Part 13 of this chapter.
K. All parking areas shall be screened from adjacent residential uses,
streets, and pedestrian walkways using an adequate arrangement of
trees and/or shrubs and meet the regulations in § 1321 in the
supplemental regulations.
L. Certification for appropriate access for emergency vehicles shall be in
writing by the Friendship Fire and Hose Co. No. 1 and Northwest
Emergency Medical Services.
M. The proposed or expanded use or structure shall not impact any
planned improvement, if any, detailed on the Official Map.
N. All other regulations of the district, including permitted uses, height
regulations, lot area, width and impervious coverage must be met.
A. The building or group of buildings proposed for adaptive reuse must
have historical, architectural, or economic significance to the
neighborhood and community, justifying renovation and preservation,
as determined by recommendation of the Borough's Planning
Commission and decision of Borough Council.
§ 1516 FOREWORD § 1517
FWD:815
B. A detailed written proposal for the adaptive reuse, the type of use
proposed, and explanation of how the proposed adaptive reuse presents
long-term benefits to the neighborhood and community where the
building or group of buildings is located must be provided. The
application package must also include a sketch plan, architectural
elevations, and landscaping design plans for proposed changes to the
building(s) or lot.
C. The proposed adaptive reuse must be a commercial or residential use
as permitted by right or conditional review, not including special
exception uses, in the Borough's CBD and/or residential zoning districts
as outlined by the Borough's zoning ordinance or a use of essentially
the same impact and character as determined by recommendation of
the Borough's Planning Commission and decision of Borough Council.
D. If the proposed parking for the adaptive reuse does not meet the
requirements of Part 16 of this chapter, the applicant must provide for
Planning Commission review and Borough Council approval a detailed
parking proposal for each proposed use, including 1) the projected
number of all tenants and employees occupying the building(s) and the
projected number of other occupants of the building(s) at peak times of
use, and 2) a plan for how the parking needs for each proposed use are
to be met.
E. The proposed adaptive reuse of a building or group of buildings
encourages the rehabilitation and reuse of the building in a manner that
preserves features of historical, architectural, or economic significance.
F. The proposed adaptive reuse does not displace viable uses for the
zoning district in which it is located.

B. Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this Part shall be construed as
prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure or growth
of any tree to a height up to 60 feet above the surface of the land.
1. Use Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, no
use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this
Part in such a manner as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and
aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair
visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or
otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
2. Nonconforming Uses.
A. Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
Part shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or
other change or alternation of any structure or tree not conforming
to the regulations as of the effective date of this Part or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use, except as
provided in this Part relating to permits and variances. Nothing
contained herein shall require any change in the construction,
alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this Part
and is diligently executed.
B. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this subsection, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure
or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and
maintenance thereon or nearby of such markers and lights as shall
be deemed necessary by the Borough Council of the Borough of
Elizabethtown to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity
of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such
§ 1803 ELIZABETHTOWN CODE § 1804
FWD:836
§ 1805. Permits and Variances; Enforcement; Notice. [Ord. 766, 5/
16/1996, § 18.4]
markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at
the expense of the owner of structures or objects.
1. Future Uses.
A. Except as specifically provided in this section, no material change
shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or
otherwise established and no tree shall be planted in any zone
hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for
and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the
purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting
use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit
shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the
provisions of this Part shall be granted unless a variance has been
approved in accordance with Subsection 4 hereafter.
(1) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree of
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such zones.
(2) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of
the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such approach zones.
(3) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall
be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or
structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
feature, would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such transition zones.
B. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or
alteration of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of
the height limits established by this Part, except that no permit is
required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of
existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of
an existing structure.
§ 1804 FOREWORD § 1805
FWD:837
2. Existing Uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or rebuilt or tree allowed to grow higher or
replanted, a permit must be secured from the Borough authorizing the
replacement or change. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming
use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than
it was on the effective date of this Part or any amendments thereto or
than it is when the application for a permit is made.
3. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Borough
Council of the Borough of Elizabethtown determines that a
nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80%
torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure to tree to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from this Part.
4. Variance.
A. Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of
any structure or permit the growth of any object of natural growth
or otherwise use his property in violation of airport zoning
regulations may apply to the Zoning Hearing Board for a variance
from the zoning regulations in question. A variance shall only be
granted after the requirements of Subsections 6 and 7 hereafter
are satisfied. A variance may be allowed where a literal application
or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not
be contrary to the public interest but would do substantial justice
and would be in accordance with the spirit of this Part. Any
variance may be granted subject to any reasonable condition that
the Zoning Hearing Board may deem necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this Part.
B. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the
effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Additionally, no
application for variance to the requirements of this Part may be
considered by the Zoning Hearing Board unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the airport manager (or person of
equivalent description) for advice as to the aeronautical effects of
the variance. If the airport manager (or person of equivalent
description) does not respond to the application within 15 days
after receipt, the Zoning Hearing Board may act without such input
to grant or deny said application.
5. Hazard Marking and Lighting. In granting any permit or variance under
this Section, the Board shall, if it deems the action advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this Part and reasonable under the
circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to required the
owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit

FWD:838
§ 1806. Relationship to Existing Districts. [Ord. 766, 5/16/1996,
§ 18.5]
These airport hazard regulations shall be an overlay zoning district to the
existing zoning districts. All of the provisions of the underlying zoning
districts shall remain in full force, except that these additional procedures
and requirements of this Part also apply. In the event of conflict between
the regulations of this Part and any other regulations applicable to the
same area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures
or trees, the use of land or any other matter, and whether the other
regulations were adopted in this chapter, in another ordinance, by some
other municipality, by the State or Federal government or otherwise, the
more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.
§ 1807. Appointment of Board of Appeals. [Ord. 766, 5/16/1996,
§ 18.6]
For purposes of this Section, the Elizabethtown Zoning Hearing Board is
appointed as the Board of Appeals, to hear and decide appeals, special
exceptions and requests for variances pursuant to this Part.
the Borough, at its own expense, or require the person or persons
requesting the permit or variance to install, operate and maintain
thereon such markers and lights as may be required by guidelines or
regulations adopted by the FAA.
6. Local Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to
administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications
for permits and variances shall be made to the Zoning Officer upon a
form published for that purpose. Applications required by this Part to
be submitted to the Zoning Officer shall be promptly considered and
granted or denied. Application for action by the Zoning Hearing Board
shall be forthwith transmitted by the Zoning Officer.
7. Notice to Department. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
Borough or board which decides to grant a permit or variance under
