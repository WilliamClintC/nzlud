Floodplain Management
[Adopted 8-14-1995 by Ord. No. 95-7; amended 9-15-2014 by Ord.
No. 14-03]
§ 95-7. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,35 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of Tarentum does hereby
order as follows.
§ 95-8. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 95-9. Applicability.
§ 95-10. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough of Tarentum unless a permit

B. A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or
structures.

§ 95-11. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
§ 95-12. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
§ 95-13. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.
§ 95-14. Permits required.
A permit shall be required before any construction or development is
undertaken within any area of the Borough of Tarentum.
§ 95-15. Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Tarentum or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
A. The Zoning Officer is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this
chapter and is referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator. The
Floodplain Administrator may: (A) fulfill the duties and responsibilities
set forth in these regulations, (B) delegate duties and responsibilities
set forth in these regulations to qualified technical personnel, plan
examiners, inspectors, and other employees, or (C) enter into a written
agreement or written contract with another agency or private sector
entity to administer specific provisions of these regulations.
Administration of any part of these regulations by another entity shall
not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant to the
participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as
set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 C.F.R. Section 59.22.
B. In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain
Administrator duties are to be fulfilled by the President of Council.
A. The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit only after it has been
determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in
§ 95-11 TARENTUM CODE § 95-15
92:68
conformance with the requirements of this and all other applicable
codes and ordinances.
B. Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review the application for the permit to determine if all other necessary
government permits required by state and federal laws have been
obtained, such as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities
Act36 (Act 1966-537, as amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and
Encroachments Act37 (Act 1978-325, as amended); the Pennsylvania
Clean Streams Act38 (Act 1937-394, as amended); and the U.S. Clean
Water Act, Section 404, 33, U.S.C. 1344. No permit shall be issued until
this determination has been made.
C. During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other
authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine that the work
is progressing in compliance with the information provided on the
permit application and with all applicable municipal laws and
ordinances. He/she shall make as many inspections during and upon
completion of the work as are necessary.
D. In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or
development in the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of
proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of
this chapter.
E. In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and
ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall
revoke the permit and report such fact to the Council for whatever
action it considers necessary.
F. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain in perpetuity all records
associated with the requirements of this chapter including, but not
limited to, finished construction elevation data, permitting, inspection
and enforcement.
G. The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for submitting a
biennial report to FEMA concerning community participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program.
H. The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments
of the Floodplain Administrator can be delegated from the person
identified. However, the ultimate responsibility lies with the person
identified in the floodplain ordinance as the floodplain administrator/
manager.

PA Code and the 2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC or latest revisions thereof.

B. If any proposed construction or development is located entirely or
partially within any identified floodplain area, applicants for permits
shall provide all the necessary information in sufficient detail and
clarity to enable the Floodplain Administrator to determine that:
(1) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage and conform with the requirements of this and all other
applicable codes and ordinances;
(2) All utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water

§ 95-23. Identification.
§ 95-24. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Borough of Tarentum, classified as Special Flood
Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
September 26, 2014 and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study, and
(2) Any community identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by Borough of Tarentum and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
(1) The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term
shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special
flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(a) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
(2) The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
§ 95-23 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 95-24
92:75
§ 95-25. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 95-28B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 95-26. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Tarentum and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(a) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(3) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
B. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only
by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
C. Community identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Borough of Tarentum has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas,
as delineated and adopted on a "local flood hazard map" using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.
§ 95-24 TARENTUM CODE § 95-27
92:76
§ 95-27. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
§ 95-28. General.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development, shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
(1) any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations
within the floodway; or (2) any development occurring in Zones A1-30
and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of
more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or (3) alteration or
relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts
and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
(3) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map
revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44
CFR Part 67.

all account balances have been settled. The property owner, whether
the account is in the name of the property owner, tenant or lessee, is
liable for the account balance. The Borough reserves the right to place
a municipal lien upon the real property upon which the demand for

use of the Department's meter and transforming equipment. The
customer shall permit properly identified Borough personnel to remove,
inspect and alter such equipment. Any Borough-owned equipment
damaged, destroyed, altered or otherwise prevented from properly
registering the energy supplied to the customer, due to the act, failure
to act or negligence of the customer or his representative, will result
in the customer's responsibility for all necessary repairs, equipment
replacement and the reasonable costs of investigation needed to
determine the amount of energy not registered and an estimate of the
energy not registered.
B. Meter-reading intervals for customers without demand meters. Meters
shall be read at regular intervals of approximately 60 days. Since bills
will be rendered on a monthly basis, the customer's electric use will be
estimated for the interim billing month and the necessary adjustment
will be made upon actual reading of the meter.
C. Meter-reading intervals for customers with demand meters. All
customers with a demand meter will have their meter/s read on a
monthly basis, approximately 30 days. If such scheduled meter reading
cannot be obtained, the customer's use will be estimated and the
demand kW shall be based on the customer's history. Any adjustment in
the bill will be made on the next meter reading.
A. Service location. The customer shall request from the Electric
Department the electric service location prior to commencing any
electrical installation work.

current version of the National Electrical Code. Compliance with
the Code should result in an installation essentially free from
hazard but not necessarily efficient, convenient, or adequate for
good service or future expansion of electrical use.
(2) In buildings where wiring is new or where a major alteration of
wiring or equipment has taken place, the Electric Department shall
not furnish service until the Borough has received a certificate of
approval issued by a Fire Underwriters Inspector or other Boroughapproved
electrical inspector.
(3) The Borough is not responsible for any injury or damage which may
result from defects in customer wiring or devices upon connection
of the customer's wires to the Borough's system.

property of the Borough. Any facilities installed by the Electric
Department not provided in a standard installation shall be paid for
by the customer for whom the facilities are installed.
A. Capacity of facilities. The Electric Department facilities installed for the
customer are in accordance with information provided by the customer.
Any facility damaged because of incorrect information and/or customer
electrical load increases not reported to the Borough will be the
responsibility of the customer.
B. Single-phase Service. The Electric Department reserves the right to
restrict the types of load connected to a single-phase service and may
require loads deemed objectionable be removed from the system.
C. Meter testing. The Department shall not be required to test its
polyphase meters more than once within an eight-year period or its
single-phase meters more than once within a thirty-year period. The
customer may request a meter be tested only upon payment of a fee
established by Borough Council resolution. The fee shall be retained by
the Department whenever the accuracy of the meter is determined to
be within the limits of plus or minus 2%. Whenever the accuracy of the
meter is determined to be outside the limits of plus-or-minus 2%, the
Department shall repair the meter, refund the fee, and adjust the
customer's account accordingly.
D. Distribution line extension. The Department may, at its discretion,
construct, own and maintain all distribution line extensions up to 100
feet along a public street. All other costs in excess will be the
responsibility of the customer. The customer shall make a
nonrefundable payment for the estimated costs for the line extension.
E. Service line extension. The Department will extend overhead service
lines on public or private property for a distance of not more than a
nominal 100 feet at no cost to the customer. Any customer who requires
a service line in excess of 100 feet shall make a nonrefundable payment
of the estimated costs for the line in excess of 100 feet.
F. Undergrounding of facilities. At the request of the customer, the
Department may determine the practicality and costs of providing
underground service to the customer. If the Department agrees to
install such service, the customer shall, prior to any installation, pay to
the Department all costs in excess of the costs which would be incurred
for normal overhead service. The customer will be required to provide
the necessary trenching and backfilling for such underground service.
G. Pole removal or relocation. The costs of any pole removal or relocation
made at the request of the customer is the cost responsibility of that

A load emergency shall exist whenever the demands for power on all or
on a portion of the Borough's electric system exceed or threaten to exceed
system capacity, or whenever system instability could result in expected
or actual system overloads. In such an event, the Department shall take
such reasonable steps under the circumstances to control the load upon the
system. Such measures may include but are not limited to the reduction or
interruption of electrical service to one or more customers.
§ 111-19. Rule 11: Limits of service agreement.

published by the International Code Council, be and is hereby adopted
as the Property Maintenance Code of the Borough of Tarentum in the

§ 190-3. Clean-up ticket.
As an additional remedy, and not in limitation of any other remedy available
to the Borough, the Ordinance Enforcement Officer may issue a clean-up
ticket to an owner or occupant of property being maintained in violation of
this article, as follows:
Each day of violation shall be subject to fines and penalties,
consecutively; for each day shall constitute a separate offense.
A. For owners or occupants who are, at the time of violation, already in
noncompliance with a notice to maintain previously issued pursuant to
this section, a clean-up ticket may be issued immediately upon
observation of violation by the Ordinance Enforcement Officer.
B. For all other owners or occupants, a clean-up ticket may be issued only
when the owner or occupant has failed for a period of at least five days
to comply with a notice issued pursuant to this section.
C. The clean-up ticket may be mailed or handed to the owner or occupant
of the premises, or may be posted upon the premises upon which the
violation occurred, by the Ordinance Enforcement Officer, who shall
keep a record of the issuance of the clean-up ticket. The clean-up ticket
will specify the amount that must be paid to the Borough and the
deadline for payment in order to avoid the issuance of a citation. If the
owner or occupant to whom the ticket has been issued fails to pay the
amount specified within the specified deadline, or indicates a desire to
plead not guilty and the Ordinance Enforcement Officer desires to
proceed with the case, then the Ordinance Enforcement Officer may file
a citation with the proper authority. If the defendant pays the amount
specified on the clean-up ticket and comes into compliance with the
ordinance as directed on the clean-up ticket, the case will be concluded
without filing a citation or other institution of a criminal proceeding.

form clean-up ticket to be used in accordance with this article.

material collected and marketed in cases where
recyclables are commingled with the establishment's
waste. The type and weight of recyclables generated
§ 210-5 SIGNS § 210-5
207:219
by an individual establishment may be approximated
based on a representative sample of its waste.
[2] For Subsection C(1)(b)[1][b] and [c], where recyclables
from several establishments are collected in the same
vehicle, an individual establishment's contribution to the
load may be apportioned. Only the weight of materials

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 214-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Tarentum Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 214-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 214-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 214-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes,
flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including regulation of development and activities causing accelerated
runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the
protection of people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the
environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure (GI) and low impact development (LID)
are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by
using systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1)
infiltrate and recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use
precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices
and LID contribute to the restoration or maintenance of
predevelopment hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) program.
§ 214-1 SIGNS § 214-3
207:235
§ 214-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,81as amended, and/or the Act
of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as
amended, The Stormwater Management Act.
§ 214-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter.
§ 214-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 214-7. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes
and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the
municipality.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

§ 214-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 214-9. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality
purporting to validate such a violation.
§ 214-10. Waivers.
A. If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity the municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to Subsection B. The proposed area of
disturbance shall be less than one acre. The request for a modification
or waiver shall originate with the landowner, shall be in writing, and
shall accompany the stormwater management site plan submitted to
the municipality. The request shall provide the facts on which the
request is based, the provisions of the chapter involved, and the
proposed modification. The designated plan reviewer shall review the
request to determine if it meets the requirements of the chapter,
including Subsection B below. If acceptable to the municipality, the
municipality may grant the waiver or modification.
B. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of unique physical circumstances or conditions peculiar to the
land in question, provided that the modifications will not be contrary or
detrimental to the public interest and will achieve the intended
outcome, and that the purpose of the chapter is preserved. Hardship
must be due to such unique physical circumstances or conditions and
not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions
of the Stormwater Management Ordinance. Cost or financial burden
shall not be considered a hardship. Modifications shall not substantially
or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property. A request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany
the stormwater management site plan submission, as directed in
Subsection A above.
C. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be
granted by the municipality.

from any natural source or delineated by applicable FEMA maps and
studies as being a special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that
comprise Group 13 Soils, as listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania
DEP Technical Manual for Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended
or replaced from time to time by DEP).
FLOODWAY  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of
the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the 100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary
of the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies
provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies have
defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is assumed, absent
evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the stream to
50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS  Planning and
activities necessary for the management of forestland. These include
conducting a timber inventory, preparation of forest management
plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting budgets, logging road design and

GROUNDWATER RECHARGE  The replenishment of existing natural
underground water supplies from precipitation or overland flow.
HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG)  Infiltration rates of soils vary
widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface
intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D)
according to their minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare
soil after prolonged wetting. The NRCS defines the four groups and
provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group
classification. The soils in the area of the development site may be
identified from a soil survey report that can be obtained from local
NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious
as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS82).
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA)  A surface that
prevents the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces
(or areas) shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor
living spaces, patios, garages, storage sheds and similar structures; and
any new streets or sidewalks. Decks, parking areas, and driveway areas
are counted as impervious areas if they directly prevent infiltration.

land or space between or among two or more existing or prospective
occupants by means of, or for the purpose of streets, common areas,
leaseholds, condominiums, building groups, or other features; (ii) any
subdivision of land; (iii) development in accordance with Section
503(1.1) of the PA Municipalities Planning Code.83
LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  Site design approaches and
small-scale stormwater management practices that promote the use
of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of
rainwater. LID can be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and
revitalization projects. LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate,
filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to its source. Rather than rely
on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment systems, LID addresses
stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective landscape features
located on-site.

that is captured and not released directly into the surface waters of this
commonwealth during or after a storm event.
RETURN PERIOD  The average interval, in years, within which a
storm event of a given magnitude can be expected to occur one time.
For example, the twenty-five-year return period rainfall would be
expected to occur on average once every 25 years; or stated in another
way, the probability of a twenty-five-year storm occurring in any one

updated.
E. Impervious areas:
(1) The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages.
(2) For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this chapter.
(3) For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
chapter; except that the volume controls in § 214-14 and the peak
rate controls of § 214-15 do not need to be retrofitted to existing
impervious areas that are not being altered by the proposed

A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual96) is applicable as
a method to any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions. The following shall be incorporated
into the CG-1 method:
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff
flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer provides
justification that the listed removal options are not feasible, and the
designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a
facility designed for a twenty-four-to-seventy-two-hour dewatering
time in an area with a dedicated stormwater system (not
contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in
a facility designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an
area contributory to a combined sewer system before discharge to
local stormwater systems or the environment.
(3) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) 20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be
considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing
conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual97) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm
Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff
flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer provides
justification that the listed removal options are not feasible, and the
designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a
facility designed for a twenty-four-hour dewatering time in an area

with a dedicated stormwater system (not contributory to a
combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility designed
for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area contributory
to a combined sewer system before discharge to local stormwater
systems or the environment.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 214-16, Rate
controls.
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan:
Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events. This is the
equivalent to a 100% release rate area when compared to those rates
shown in the maps contained in Appendix A (New and Existing Release
Rate Management Districts). This predevelopment to postdevelopment
control is not to be misconstrued as the same as the
"Conditional Direct Discharge" areas on the release rate maps. If
it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the postdevelopment
analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the pre-development analysis for one-, two-,
five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storms,
then the requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the
applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the
peak rate of discharge requirement. Peak flows should be computed
using the methods included in the chapter titled "Stormwater
Calculations and Methodology" of the PADEP Stormwater
Management BMP Manual.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events, the postdevelopment
peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved
release rate maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A (New and
Existing Release Rate Management Districts) of this chapter. For any
areas not shown on the release rate maps, the post-development
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates
for the specified design events. Peak flows should be computed using
the methods included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP Stormwater
Management BMP Manual.

A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The intent of this
chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve
stream water quality. The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland
flow to the stream through the presence of native grasses, trees and
shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater recharge; causing deposition
of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the buffer
rather than in the stream; and reducing erosion by providing stream
bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams; keeping waters
cooler and reducing evaporation.
B. Except as required by PA Code Title 25 Chapter 102, the riparian buffer
easement shall be required for all streams (as defined in § 214-12) with
a contributing watershed area of greater than 10 acres. The riparian
buffer easement shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet from the
top of the streambank (on each side).
C. Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
(1) No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted
that is inconsistent with the intent of the riparian buffer as
described in Subsection A.
(2) Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
(3) Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
D. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate county recorder of deeds
office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the
property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued
private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area
required by zoning, unless otherwise specified in the municipal Zoning
Ordinance.
E. Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing
100-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
F. Stormwater drainage pipes shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement, but they shall cross the easement in the shortest practical
distance. Other structural stormwater management facilities are not
permitted within the riparian buffer easement.
§ 214-17 SIGNS § 214-17
207:251
G. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted by the municipality within riparian
buffers:
(1) It is preferred that trails be designed to be permeable and for
nonmotorized use only; however, impermeable trails are permitted
provided they have adequate drainage
(2) Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
H. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
I. Underground utilities shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement; however, work shall be performed to minimize disturbance
area and removal of trees. Restoration within the riparian buffer
easement shall be with native species of trees, grasses, and other
plantings. One tree shall be planted for each tree removed and the
restoration shall be designed by a registered professional with the
requisite experience. Aboveground utilities shall only be permitted to
cross the easement perpendicular to the easement or in the shortest
practical distance. Existing utilities may remain and be maintained as
required.

work at the site of same. The notice shall contain a brief statement of
the grounds relied upon for revoking the permit. Such notice may be
given either by personal delivery to the person or agent of the permittee
engaged in the work at the site or by certified or registered United
States mail addressed to the permittee. When any permit has been
revoked and the work authorized by the permit has not been completed,
the Borough may, at its discretion, elect to do such work as may be
necessary to restore the street or part thereof to as good a condition as
before the opening was made. In the event of such election, all expenses
incurred by Tarentum Borough shall be recovered from the permittee,
or their surety set forth hereafter, or other party who may be
responsible for making such repairs as the case may be.
I. Record keeping by Borough. The Borough Manager, their deputy or
authorized agent, shall keep a record of the permit application, the date
of issuing such permit and of the place, character and extent of the
§ 216-24 SIGNS § 216-24
207:277
§ 216-25. Limits of work.
excavation to be performed. Upon issuing any permit, the Borough
Manager shall forthwith notify the Borough Foreman, the Chief of
Police, and any other appropriate emergency service provider of the
place, character and extent of the proposed excavations.
J. Opening pavement less than five years old; additional fees. No permit
shall be issued by the Borough Manager which would allow an
excavation or opening to be cut in a pavement less than five years old
unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate that public health or
safety require that the contemplated work be permitted or unless an
emergency condition exists. If by special action of the Borough
Manager a permit is issued to a person to open any pavement less than
five years old, an additional charge or penalty will be made for such
opening, provided, however, that no such charge or penalty will be
assessed in the event it is determined that the work is of an emergency
nature. The additional charge or penalty shall be assessed in
accordance with the schedule of permit fees attached hereto.
A. Size of openings. When excavating in any street, lane or alley for the
purpose of laying relaying, taking up or repairing any gas, water, sewer,
or other pipes, mains or conduits, not more than 100 feet lineal
measure or more than one Borough block shall be opened at one time.
B. Timely repair of openings. All streets, lanes and alleys excavated or torn
up for the purpose of laying, relaying, taking up or repairing any water,
sewer, gas, conduit or other pipes and appurtenances, and all test holes
relating thereto, shall be immediately properly backfilled in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this article.
C. Tunneling under streets. Tunneling under paved streets is prohibited
unless specially authorized in the permit issued by the Borough
Manager. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, service lines,
casings or conduits may be jacked or driven between openings provided
the permittee meets the following requirements:
(1) The permittee has submitted a detailed plan for review by the
Borough Engineer providing information as to how such jacking or
driving operation is to be performed;
(2) The Borough Engineer approves such plan and such plan becomes
part of the applicant's permit; and
(3) The permittee agrees to assume full responsibility for damage to
existing underground facilities and agrees to defend and hold
Tarentum Borough harmless thereupon.
D. Display of permit at site. Every person making or supervising any
excavation shall keep the street opening permit at the excavation site
and exhibit same to any policemen or any other authorized
representative of the Borough upon request. It shall be the duty of any
§ 216-24 TARENTUM CODE § 216-25
207:278
such officer or other authorized representative to report to the Borough
Manager the name of any person, firm, company, corporation or
authority manning any excavation without such permit or who is
violating or who has violated any of the provisions of this article. Upon
receiving a report that a person or entity has made a street opening
provided for in this article without obtaining such permit, the Borough
Manager, Chief of Police, or their duly designated deputy or agent, shall
immediately issue a citation for violation of this article and shall cause
the work to be stopped until such time that a permit under this article
is obtained.
E. Identification of person performing work. During the progress of any
work taking place under this article, a sign shall be maintained at the
excavation site bearing the name of the public utility or contractor
physically performing the work.
F. Daily work stoppages. During the course of any given day within which
work under this article is being performed, the permittee, its agent and/
or the contractor performing such work shall engage in daily work
stoppages. Daily stoppage of work shall occur as follows:
(1) Except for emergency repairs of utility facilities, work within the
pavement or shoulder shall be stopped prior to peak traffic hours
that may exist on a particular highway on a particular day and as
specified in the permit;
(2) At the end of each work day, an opening in the right-of-way shall be
closed in one of the following manners:
(a) By covering such opening with steel plates or bridging which
are less than six feet in either length or width. The plates or
bridging shall be extended a minimum of 18 inches from each
edge of the opening and shall be secured in a safe manner.
(b) Such opening may be backfilled consistent with the terms of
this article to the bottom elevation of the pavement or base
course, or to the original surface elevation if outside the
pavement and shoulder, provided, however, that said openings
have the required protection under § 216-27D (relating to work
zone traffic control) and an approved traffic control plan until
the surface is restored to its former condition.
(c) At all times, the permittee shall protect and secure its openings
to provide for the safety of the travelling public, including
motorists, bicyclist and pedestrians.
G. Storage of excavation materials. Materials either removed from the
excavation site, including spoil, or materials used in conjunction with
the work, shall be the responsibility of the permittee, and shall be
disposed of as follows:
§ 216-25 SIGNS § 216-25
207:279
§ 216-26. Restoration of openings.
(1) The permittee shall keep the improved area free of material which
may be deposited by vehicles travelling upon or entering onto the
highway during the performance of work authorized by the permit.
(2) The permittee is responsible for controlling dust conditions created
by its own operations.
(3) Excess material, spoil and material that is not suitable for backfill
shall be promptly removed and properly disposed of outside the
right-of-way as the work progresses.
(4) Other materials shall be stored so that there is no interference with
the flow of highway traffic or drainage.
(5) The permittee shall not close any portion of the pavement or
shoulder to vehicular or pedestrian traffic for the primary purpose
of storing material. If the permittee stores material on a sidewalk,
pavement or shoulder, the permittee thereby acknowledges its
obligation and commitment to repair or reconstruct the pavement
and the shoulder, if damaged, to its former condition in a manner
approved by the Borough Engineer. Under no circumstances shall
delivered materials be stored overnight on the pavement.
(6) In the event materials are stored on a sidewalk, the shoulder or
pavement, the Borough Engineer may authorize the permittee to
restore the sidewalk, pavement or shoulder from superficial
surface damage by using a seal coat or service treatment.
A. Backfilling. An opening shall be backfilled by the permittee in
accordance with the following:
(1) The opening may first be backfilled with fine aggregate material, or
granular material to protect the facility, placed to a height not to
exceed one foot over the top of the facility, if the material is
compacted in not more than four-inch loose layers or as authorized
by the Borough Engineer. To help protect its facility from future
excavations, the permittee is encouraged to place a permanent
colored ribbon at least one foot above its facility. If the facility is
nonmetallic, the permittee is also encouraged to place a metallic
ribbon at a depth from which the ribbon can be sensed by typical
metal locating instruments.
(2) The opening shall then be backfilled with select granular material,
unless retained suitable material is authorized by the Borough
Engineer, or other coarse aggregate material that may be specified
in the permit. All backfilling shall be in compliance with the
backfilling design specifications set forth by the Borough Engineer.
Select granular material or other aggregate material will be
required for use as backfill of openings in pavements, paved
shoulders and improved (i.e. oil and chip) shoulders as well as
§ 216-25 TARENTUM CODE § 216-26
207:280
unimproved (i.e. stabilized or earth surface) shoulders within three
feet of the edge of the pavement. Retained suitable material will
normally be authorized for use as backfill of openings outside
shoulders and in unimproved shoulders more than three feet
outside the edge of pavement and up to within three feet of the
surface.
(3) Backfill shall be compacted as follows:
(a) General rule. Except as provided in Subsection A(3)(b)
material shall be placed in loose layers not to exceed eight
inches if vibratory compaction equipment is used or as
authorized by the Borough Engineer. Each layer shall be
thoroughly compacted to preclude subsidence.
(b) Compaction outside pavement and shoulders. At least 15 days
prior to the start of work, the applicant may submit its written
compaction plan to the Borough Engineer requesting backfill
in an opening outside the pavement and shoulder to be placed
in layers thicker than eight inches prior to compaction.
(c) The compaction plan shall include full details on equipment,
materials and work methods as well as the permittee's
acknowledgment of its obligation and commitment to regularly
monitor the restored surface until two years after the
acknowledged completion of the permitted work and to
promptly correct failure or subsidence of the highway. The
Borough Engineer may condition their approval of a
compaction plan on the execution of a bond, if a part of the
opening is within the approved area.
(d) Existing pavement elevation. Compaction shall be completed
to the bottom elevation of the existing pavement.
(4) The Borough Engineer may require the permittee to have material
proposed for use as backfill and compacted material tested, at the
expense of the permittee, for conformance to applicable gradation
and compaction requirements.
(5) Openings in the pavement or shoulder that are made as the result
of emergency work may be immediately backfilled with excavated
material that is treated with a recognized chemical soil stabilizer at
a minimum rate of 100 pounds stabilizer per cubic yard of backfill,
if the stabilized backfill is compacted under Subsection A(3)(c).
(6) Test holes shall be backfilled, as soon as safely possible, with
existing type material or other material authorized by the Borough
Engineer and sealed under this article. The Borough Engineer may
authorize test holes in the pavement or shoulder to be restored
without a one foot cutback of the surrounding surface.

accomplished as follows:
(1) At the time of application for a permit, the permittee shall submit a
restoration plan for approval by the Borough Engineer;
(2) Restoration of the surface shall be accomplished by the reuse of as
much of the existing brick, cobblestone or original surface material
as possible;
(3) The restoration plan shall include the manner in which subsurface
restoration and backfilling shall occur;
(4) The Borough Engineer shall review the restoration plan prior to the
issuance of the street opening permit and may modify the proposed
restoration plan to ensure that the surface is properly restored;
(5) No permit shall be issued for opening a brick, cobblestone or other
unique surface without the prior approval of the applicant's
restoration plan by the Borough Engineer.
C. Restoration of flexible base pavements. Base and surface restoration of
flexible base pavements shall be performed under this subsection and
as specified in the permit. Prior to replacement of the base course, one
foot outside of each edge of the opening shall be sawed, in a neat
straight line, to the top elevation of the existing aggregate subbase or
stone base course, and the detached material shall be removed. Other
surface opening methods such as cutting may be authorized if the
methods result in the opened pavement having a neat straight vertical
line.
(1) Exposed vertical and horizontal surfaces shall be prepared under
current PennDOT specifications.
(2) The base course shall consist of bituminous concrete meeting the
requirements of current PennDOT specifications or other base
course material authorized by the Borough Engineer. The base
course material shall have a minimum depth of five inches or a
depth equal to the existing base course, whichever is greater.
(3) If required, the binder course shall consist of ID-2 material meeting
the requirements of current PennDOT specifications. The binder
course shall have a minimum depth of two inches or a depth equal
to the existing binder course, whichever is greater.
(4) The wearing course shall consist of ID-2 material or FJ-1 material
meeting the requirements of current PennDOT specifications. The
wearing course shall have a minimum depth of 1 1/2 inch ID-2, or
one inch FJ-1, or a depth equal to the existing wearing course,
whichever is greater.
§ 216-26 TARENTUM CODE § 216-26
207:282
D. Restoration of plan or reinforced cement concrete pavements. Base and
surface restoration of plain or reinforced cement concrete pavements
shall be performed under this subsection and as specified in the permit.
Drilling is not permitted where sawing or cutting is required.
(1) Prior to replacement of the pavement, one foot outside of each
edge of the opening shall be sawed the full depth of pavement in a
neat straight line. The detached material shall be removed without
damaging the adjacent pavement. The use of a pavement breaker is
prohibited. The permittee may partially saw cut the pavement to a
depth of at least three inches and cut the remaining pavement with
a jackhammer weighing no more than 90 pounds, if:
(a) The restored opening does not exceed six feet in either length
or width.
(b) The restored opening is at least two feet from a pavement edge
or joint.
(c) The highway average daily traffic (ADT) does not exceed 5,000
vehicles per twenty-four-hour period.

width.
(b) Replacing the opened pavement longitudinally to a transverse
joint or opening within six linear feet of the opening.
(5) The surface shall be restored as follows:
(a) After surface corrections have been completed and before the
concrete becomes nonplastic, the surface shall be given a
textured finish that matches the existing adjacent surface. The
surface shall be cured under current PennDOT specifications.
(b) Restoration of the binder and wearing courses of a cement
concrete pavement which has a bituminous surface shall be
done under Subsection C (relating to the restoration of flexible
base pavements).
§ 216-26 SIGNS § 216-26
207:283
E. Shoulder restoration. Shoulder restoration shall be performed under
this subsection and as specified in the permit.
(1) Paved shoulders. Paved shoulders shall be reconstructed and
restored to a serviceable condition, of the same type as existed
before the start of work, under current PennDOT specifications,
and PennDOT roadway construction standards.
(2) Other shoulders. Other shoulders shall be restored as follows:
(a) The surface shall be restored with at least two inches of select
granular material, or as authorized by the Borough Engineer.
(b) If the length of the open shoulder exceeds 100 linear feet, the
shoulder shall be graded, rolled and unless excused penetrated
with bituminous material specified by current PennDOT
specifications, at a minimum rate of .20 gallon per square yard
and chipped or lightly sanded to prevent tracking of oil onto
the pavement.
(3) Outside existing shoulder. If the disturbed area extends outside the
existing shoulder, the disturbed area outside the restored shoulder
shall be properly graded and a ditch line shall be constructed
wherever necessary to maintain highway drainage.
F. Temporary pavement restoration. Permanent restoration of a pavement
or paved shoulder shall be required immediately upon completion of the
work specified in the permit. However, temporary restoration of a
pavement or paved shoulder may be permitted by the Borough
Engineer prior to permanent restoration, under and subject to the
following:
(1) The base shall consist of compacted select granular material with a
surface of two-inch bituminous material. If the existing pavement
structure includes a course of subbase material, it shall be replaced
to a depth equal to the existing course depth with material meeting
the requirements of current PennDOT specifications.
(2) Temporary pavement restoration shall be completed before traffic
is allowed to travel on the disturbed area. The temporary pavement
may be kept in place for up to six months or as specified in the
permit, if it is properly maintained.
(3) The temporary pavement shall be removed and permanent
restoration performed under Subsection C, D or E.
G. Appurtenances to underground installations. Requirements relating to
appurtenances to underground installations shall include:
(1) The top of every manhole, valve box or other access to the facility
shall be at the same elevation as the surface in which it is located.
§ 216-26 TARENTUM CODE § 216-26
207:284
(2) The surface surrounding manhole covers located in paved
shoulders shall be paved with four inches bituminous concrete base
course a distance of at least one foot around the structure to

H. Additional restoration. Additional restoration shall be required as
follows:
(1) Disturbed portions of the highway, including, but not limited to,
slopes and appurtenances and structures such as guide rails,
curbs, signs, markings, drain pipes, driveways and vegetation, shall
be restored by the permittee to a condition at least equal to that
which existed before the start of work authorized by the permit, if
the restoration is consistent with the "roadway construction
standards" set forth herein. Additional restoration may also be
required, upon written notification, to restore the structural
integrity of the pavement or shoulder.
(2) If the permittee opens pavement having a bituminous concrete
surface and the wearing course for such road surface is less than
five years old, the permittee shall, in addition to the restoration
conditions outlined in the permit and in this section, overlay the
pavement in accordance with the following conditions:
(a) When a longitudinal opening longer than 100 linear feet has
been made in the pavement, the permittee shall overlay the
lanes in which the opening was made, for the entire length of
highway that was opened, in a manner authorized by the
Borough Engineer.
(b) When two or more transverse openings have been made within
100 linear feet of pavement, the permittee shall overlay lanes
in which the openings were made, for the entire length of
highway between the openings, in a manner authorized by the
Borough Engineer.
(c) When four or more emergency openings have been made by
the same permittee within 100 linear feet of pavement, the
permittee shall overlay lanes in which the openings were
made, for the entire length of highway between the openings,
in a manner authorized by the Borough Engineer.
(d) If disturbed lanes adjacent to undisturbed lanes are overlaid,
the edge of the disturbed lane shall be saw cut or milled to a
depth of 1 1/2 inch or the depth of the existing surface course,
whichever is less, for the length of the opening to insure a
smooth joint, with proper elevation and cross section. A full
§ 216-26 SIGNS § 216-26
207:285
width overlay may be authorized on various highways instead
of saw cutting or milling the disturbed lane.
(e) If disturbed lanes adjacent to shoulders are overlaid, the
shoulder shall be raised, with material and in a manner
authorized by the Borough Engineer for the type of existing
shoulder, so that the overlaid pavement and shoulder edges are
at the same elevation.
(3) Regardless of the age of the wearing course:
(a) If more than 100 linear feet of longitudinal or transverse
openings, or both, are made in the pavement, the Borough
Engineer may require the permittee to overlay lanes in which
the openings were made, for the entire length of highway that
was opened, if the Borough Engineer determines that the
rideability or structural integrity of the pavement has been
impaired by the openings.
(b) If four or more openings are made by the same permittee
within 100 linear feet of pavement, the district office may
require the permittee to restore the entire disturbed pavement
between the openings by milling, planing or other authorized
method and overlaying the entire disturbed pavement.
(4) Aggregate used in a bituminous overlay wearing course shall
comply with skid resistance level (SRL) criteria specified by current
PennDOT specifications.
(5) If an opening is made in a bituminous concrete pavement within
three feet from the edge of pavement or other longitudinal joint or
opening, the surface restoration shall be extended to the edge of
pavement or other longitudinal joint or opening.
(6) At each end of an overlay, the permittee shall install a paving notch,
under current PennDOT specifications, by milling, planing or other
authorized method and provide a minimum ten-foot transition.
(7) The transition areas at each end of an overlay shall follow the
contour of the surrounding surface.
(8) When pavement markings on more than 100 linear feet of highway
are covered or destroyed by the permitted work, including
overlays, they shall be replaced with temporary pavement
markings, under 67 Pa. Code § 203.72 (relating to temporary
pavement markings) before opening the disturbed pavement to
traffic. When the pavement surface is restored, pavement markings
that were covered or destroyed shall be replaced in their former
location.

§ 216-27. Street closings.
I. Sealing. Restored openings in the pavement or paved shoulder shall be
sealed under current PennDOT specifications relative to bituminous
concrete or cement concrete, as the case may be.
J. Multiple openings by more than one permittee. In the event more than
one utility company, permittee or contractor is excavating separately,
and any portion of those excavations or patches resulting therefrom are
within 100 feet of one another, then the road surface between such
patches shall be milled and repaved under the direction of the Borough
Engineer, with the costs of same prorated among the utility companies
or permittees performing such excavation work.
K. Notice to commence backfilling. The permittee shall notify the Borough
Foreman of their intentions to backfill at least 24 hours in advance of
starting. The Borough Foreman shall be present during the backfilling
operation and the pouring of any concrete slab or surface course.
Failure to provide such notice, or the failure of the permittee to have
the backfilling and pouring of the concrete slab or permanent surface
performed under the supervision of the Borough Foreman is a violation
of this article, subject to the penalties prescribed herein. In addition,
the failure to provide such notice and to obtain the supervision of the
Borough Foreman may result in the removal of the backfill and slab and
the performance of such work over to the satisfaction of the Borough
Foreman. In the event it is necessary to remove and replace the
improperly installed surface or backfill, all other street opening permits
for such permittee shall be immediately suspended and no further
permits shall be issued to such permittee until the backfilling and
permanent surface restoration work has been properly completed.
L. Settlement within five years of backfilling. Where an opening has been
closed and a settlement occurs within five years from the date of the
work, such settlement shall be considered to have been caused by faulty
backfilling and shall constitute a violation of this article.
A. Closings for general excavation; notice of closing. No portion of any
street, lane or alley shall be or remain impassable for vehicular or
pedestrian traffic by reason of any excavation for more than one week
from the beginning of any work on same. The permittee shall notify
Tarentum Borough Police Department, Street Department and, at the
discretion of the Borough, the several fire departments and E.M.S.
provider(s) in the Borough, of such closing at least 48 hours in advance
of such proposed closing. Any extension of the street closing time
without penalty must first be approved by the Borough Manager or
their authorized deputy or representative.
B. Closing for repairing mains, conduits, etc.; notice of closing. No portion
of any street, lane or alley shall be or remain impassable for vehicular
or pedestrian traffic by reason of any excavation for repairing mains,
conduits or other pipes or appurtenances, or for laying or relaying new
§ 216-26 SIGNS § 216-27
207:287
house connections for more than two days from the beginning of any
work on same unless such approval is set forth in the street opening
permit. The permittee shall notify the Tarentum Borough Police
Department, Street Department and, at the discretion of the Borough,
the several fire departments and E.M.S. provider(s) in the Borough,
at least 48 hours in advance of such proposed street closing. Any
extension of the street closing time without penalty must first be
approved by the Borough Manager or their authorized representative.
C. Closing affecting intersections. No intersection of the streets, lanes or
alleys of the Borough shall be or remain impassable for vehicular or
pedestrian traffic for more than five hours during the work upon any
excavation mentioned in this article. The Permittee shall notify the
Tarentum Borough Police Department, Street Department and, at the
discretion of the Borough, the several fire departments and E.M.S.
provide(s) in the Borough, at least 48 hours in advance of such
proposed street closing. Any extension of the street closing time
mentioned in this article without penalty must first be approved by the
Borough Manager, their deputy, or their authorized representative.
D. Work zone traffic controls. Traffic in the work area subject to the street
opening permit shall be controlled consistent with the general terms,
conditions, requirements and provisions of 67 Pa. Code § 203 relating to
work zone traffic controls and meet the approval of the Chief of Police,
their deputy, or their authorized representative. The failure to employ
work zone traffic controls consistent with 67 Pa. Code § 203 or obtain
approval of same by the Chief of Police, their deputy, or their authorized
representative, shall be a violation of this article and subject to
punishment hereunder.
E. Storage of material on roadways. Material or spoil removed from
excavations should be placed so as to occupy a minimum width of
roadway. At street intersections, all spoils should be hauled away if
possible and any surplus not later needed shall be removed from the
work site immediately. When excavation takes place in an outer lane,
the permittee shall confine excavation and spoil within the outer lane by
use of bin construction or toe boards so as to prevent spoil from
spreading into and blocking another traffic lane. The permittee shall
also provide a guardrail on the traffic side of any trench. When
excavation is in the curb lane, the spoil shall be placed on the curb side
after first covering any gutter to permit free flow of drainage. Boxing of
any spoil placed on the sidewalk is essential. Under those
circumstances, a guardrail shall be placed on the traffic side of the
trench as well.
F. Closing full width of street; detours. In the event it becomes necessary
to close any portion of a street for the full width of travel thereby
excluding all traffic from the area, the permittee shall obtain approval
at least 24 hours in advance of the closing from the Chief of Police their
deputy, or their authorized representative and the permittee shall set
up proper detours at the direction of the Chief of Police. Length of

§ 216-29. Certificate of insurance.
closing a street to all traffic shall be subject to the limits of time
specified in § 216-27A, B and C.
A. Utility repair or replacement as part of overall improvement project. In
the event of an overall street improvement, the Borough Foreman shall
give reasonable notice to all public utility companies operating in the
Borough of the intention of the Borough to pave or improve a certain
street and notify the utility company that they will have 30 days from
the mailing date of such notice to lay, renew, repair or extend all
underground facilities. The time for such laying, renewing, repair or
extension of facilities may be extended upon written request to the
Borough Engineer and the approval by the Borough Engineer of same.
The extension or repair of service lines to a point outside the line of the
proposed pavement is required to be available for structures which may
be built on lots vacant as well as service lines to structures already in
existence. The Borough may, after notice to all companies affected, and
in the event that an affected company fails or refuses to comply with
such notice, refuse a future permit to such company to open the
affected street except in the case of emergency openings to make
repairs. At the time of the emergency opening, if an investigation by the
Borough Engineer indicates that the existing condition of the pipes or
conduits needing repairs is due to such company's failure to lay, renew,
repair or extend its underground facilities, then same shall constitute a
violation of this article and be subject to punishment hereunder.
B. Enlargements or improvements to existing systems. In adopting this
article, the Borough recognizes that due to land use changes certain
enlargements or improvements of the underground systems may
become necessary on both improved and unimproved streets. Proposed
changes to existing underground systems or proposed new lines or
conduits shall be submitted to the Borough Engineer for approval.
C. Abandoned facilities or systems. Whenever any pipe, conduit, duct,
tunnel or other structure located under the surface of any street or the
use thereof, is abandoned, the person or company owning, using,
controlling or having any interest therein shall notify the Borough
Engineer in writing of the intent to abandon. Such notice shall give in
detail the location, depth and size of the structure to be abandoned. If
the facts warrant the removal of the abandoned structure the person
owning such structure shall be notified by the Borough Engineer and
such person shall remove such structure at their expense within a time
period to be prescribed by the Borough Engineer. The failure to remove
such structure within the time limitation imposed by the Borough
Engineer shall constitute a violation of this article and be punishable
hereunder.

§ 216-30. Bonds.
A. Worker's compensation and liability insurance required. Along with its
application for a street opening permit, the applicant shall submit a
certificate of insurance indicating that it carries workers' compensation
insurance and is otherwise insured against claims for damages for
personal injury and property loss which may arise from or out of the
performance of the work, whether such performance is by the
applicant, their subcontractor or any one directly or indirectly
employed by the applicant. Such insurance shall include protection
against liability arising from completed operations. The amount of
coverage shall be prescribed by the Borough Engineer in accordance
with the nature of the risks involved; provided, however, that the
liability insurance for bodily injury in effect shall be in an amount not
less than $100,000 for each person and $300,000 for each accident and
for property damage in an amount not less than $50,000. The failure of
the applicant to provide such certifications shall be grounds for denying
any permit.
B. Annual insurance certificates for certain public entities. Local
Municipal Authorities and Public Utilities who regularly perform work
within the Borough may file with the Borough Manager, on or before the
15th day of January each year, a certificate of insurance providing the
minimum coverages set forth above. The Borough shall accept such
certificate as proof of coverage for all regular work performed by such
authority or utility during the calendar year, provided the local
municipal authority or public utility shall certify that such insurance
shall be in place for the calendar year in which it is given. Nothing in
this paragraph shall be deemed or construed to limit the ability of the
Borough Engineer to require higher coverage limits if the scope of the
work performed warrants same.
A. Bonds required. Each applicant, at the time of issuance of a street
opening permit, shall provide the Borough with the following bonds:
(1) When the permittee is a franchised utility, a Corporate Continuing
Bond from year to year in a minimum amount of $50,000; and
(2) When the permittee is not a franchised utility or government
agency, a Cash Bond in an amount to be determined by the Borough
Engineer, said amount to be equivalent to the Borough Engineer's
estimate of all costs, fees and expenses necessary for the
performance of the work and in meeting compliance requirements
with the provisions of this article.
B. The Borough Engineer may require a higher bond of a franchised utility
in the event he determines that the scope of the work requires same.
C. Failure to perform; notice; execution on bonds by Borough. Whenever
the Borough Manager shall find that a permittee has failed to perform
any term or condition of any permit, he shall give written notice of such
§ 216-29 TARENTUM CODE § 216-30
207:290
§ 216-31. Fines and remedies.
failure to the permittee and to the surety of the bond posted. Such
notice shall state the failure of performance, the work necessary to
be done, the estimated cost thereof and the period of time deemed by
the Borough Manager to be reasonably necessary for the completion
of such work and when such work shall recommence. In the event the
nonperformance has not been cured within the time period set forth in
such notice, then the Borough may perform such work at the expense
of the permittee and surety and may execute upon the surety's bond to
recover the costs and expenses of same. Any payment by the surety's
bond shall not absolve the surety or the permittee from any further
liability resulting from the permittee's failure to perform the work. If
a cash bond has been posted, notice of nonperformance as provided
above shall be given to the permittee and if compliance is not had
within the time specified, the Borough Manager shall proceed without
delay, and without further notice or proceedings whatsoever, to use the
cash deposited, or any portion of such deposit, to cause the required
work to be performed. In the event the cash deposit is insufficient to
cover the costs of the completion of the work, the Borough may, at its
option, pursue any remedy at law or in equity to collect the balance of
completion costs from the permittee or any other person responsible
for the work. In the event the balance of such cash deposit is sufficient
to cover the cost of the completion of the work, any remaining balance
shall be returned to the permittee, or to its successors or assigns, after
deducting the cost of the work.
D. Interference with work or work sites; penalties. No person shall
interfere with or obstruct the ingress or egress to or from any such
premises by an authorized representative or agent of any surety or of
the Borough when engaged in completing the work required to be
performed under the permit or in complying with the terms or
conditions thereof. Any attempt by any person or entity to interfere with
or obstruct work performed under this article shall be in violation
thereof and subject to those penalties set forth herein.
A. Fines. Whoever violates any of the provisions of this article shall be
guilty of a summary offense and, upon conviction thereof, be subject to
the payment of a fine of not less than $300 nor greater than $1,000
together with any costs of suit. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate summary offense. Failure to pay any fine imposed
for a violation of this article shall result in the incarceration of the
failing party for a period of not less than 30 days.
B. All remedies cumulative. Any and all remedies set forth herein for
violations of this article are cumulative. Nothing contained herein shall
be deemed or construed to limit or restrict the ability of the Borough to
pursue any action, act law or in equity, to enforce the terms of this
article, remedy violations thereof, or correct deficient work or
conditions at its discretion.

No effect on remaining provisions. If any section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase or a portion of this article is for any reason held invalid
or unconstitutional by any Court of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such
holdings shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.
§ 216-33. Repealer.
Specific ordinances repealed; construction. This article specifically repeals
Tarentum Borough ordinance No. 98-03 and all other ordinances, or parts
of ordinances, inconsistent herewith. In the event the terms and provisions
of this article are inconsistent with any other ordinance within Tarentum
Borough, the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be controlling.

A. For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and
assessed, commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging
in an occupation with a primary place of employment within the
Borough of Tarentum during the tax year. Each natural person who
exercises such privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall
pay the tax for that year in the amount of $52, assessed on a pro rata
basis, in accordance with the provisions of this article. This tax may be
allocated by the Borough Council from time to time for:

services, police services and/or fire services;

irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough is less than $12,000 for any calendar
year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for
that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from
payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which

result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.

220:300
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
shall annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough and
with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably
expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources
within the Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the Borough
utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the
exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall
have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2
forms from employment within the Borough for the year prior to
the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted
from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until
otherwise instructed by the Borough or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the Borough that the person has received earned
income and net profits from all sources within the Borough equal to
or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or
upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within
the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax
from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
§ 225-9 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 225-9
220:301
§ 225-10. Duty of employers to collect.
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the Borough may pursue
collection under this act.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from a local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayment and interest on overpayment.
(NOTE: With respect to refunds, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8425; with respect
to interest, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426.) Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to
remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is
later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for
amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The
Borough Manager or the Collector shall determine eligibility for
refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.
A. Each employer within the Borough of Tarentum, as well as those
employers situated outside the Borough of Tarentum but who engage in
business within the Borough of Tarentum, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the Borough of Tarentum and making a
return and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is
hereby authorized to deduct this tax from each employee in his or her
employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission
and whether or not all such services are performed within the Borough
of Tarentum.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
§ 225-9 TARENTUM CODE § 225-10
220:302
§ 225-11. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 225-12. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the Borough.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principle employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 225-9 this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 225-10 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 225-13
220:303
§ 225-13. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the Borough of Tarentum shall be required to comply
with this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector
on or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 225-14. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 225-15. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the Borough of Tarentum but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
Borough of Tarentum do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and
subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated
under this article with the same force and effect as though they were
residents of the Borough of Tarentum. Further, any individual engaged
in an occupation within the Borough of Tarentum and an employee of a
nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered
a self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the
Borough shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or
employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 225-15.1. Tax Collector; powers and duties.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more that one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax located nearest in miles to the person's
home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facia certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Borough Council.
It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive payments of

§ 225-15.2. Failure to pay tax.
§ 225-15.3. Violations and penalties.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or

ARTICLE IV
Residential Parking Districts
[Adopted 7-13-1992 by Ord. No. 92-6]
§ 250-30. Findings.
§ 250-31. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, words and terms listed in this section, as
follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE  A motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR  A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address; for
the purpose of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one parking
permit for that business or professional office address.
RESIDENT  A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona fide
occupancy, or both, at that address.
§ 250-32. Eligibility.
A. The Council finds that:
(1) Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter
vehicle parkings, therefore depriving the residents of those areas
of spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
(2) Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and
(3) The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week.
B. Therefore, Council considers it to be in the interest of the people of the
Borough of Tarentum to provide for the establishment of a residential
permit parking program to ensure primary access to available parking
spaces by neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner
ambient air level.
A. Criteria. The residential areas designated in this article are those
deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on the basis
of the following criteria:
(1) During any period between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.,
Monday through Sunday, except legal holidays, the number of
§ 250-30 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 250-32
246:371
§ 250-33. Designation of residential permit parking areas.
[Amended 3-17-2003 by Ord. No. 03-05]
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in
the area is equal to 70% or more of the legal on-street parking
capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal
parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
(2) During the same period as specified in Subsection A directly above,
10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in
the area are not registered in the name of a person residing in the
area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest available
information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regarding registration
of motor vehicles shall be used.
B. In determining that a specific area identified as impacted and eligible
for residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit
parking area, the following factors are taken into consideration:
(1) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
(2) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Township;
(3) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking and
related health and safety hazards;
(4) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit parking
and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection
with it; and
(6) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential
permit parking area and used by the general public for religious,
health or educational purposes.
A. The following are designated as residential permit parking areas:
(1) The south side of East Eighth Avenue from Ross Street to the
intersection of Wood Street.
(2) The west side of Allegheny Street from 3rd Avenue to 4th Avenue.
(3) No parking on the east side of Allegheny Street.
B. Permit holders must park between lines demarcating parking stalls.
Failure to park between the lines is a violation of this article and subject
to § 250-43 of this article.
§ 250-32 TARENTUM CODE § 250-34
246:372
§ 250-34. Signage.
Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit parking
area which shall notice the days, hours, locations and conditions under
which parking shall be by permit only.
§ 250-35. Permit application.
§ 250-36. Permit fee and term.
The biannual permit fee for a residential parking district permit shall be
established by resolution of Borough Council; the fee shall be payable at
the time the application is submitted. The permit term for each residential
parking district shall be determined at the time the district is designated.
Residential parking permits may be renewed by qualified residents upon
the payment of the biannual fee on or before the anniversary date of the
term. In order to renew the permit, residents must present their short-term
visitors' passes. The fee shall not be prorated. No portion of any fee is
refundable.
§ 250-37. Display of permit.
The permit shall be affixed to a window on the driver's side of the vehicle.
Short-term visitors' passes shall be displayed on the dash of the vehicle.
§ 250-38. Expiration of permits.
A permit expires and is void when the owner or user of a permitted vehicle
no longer resides within the district, as defined in § 250-32. A resident
A. An application for a residential parking district permit shall be made by
a resident or proprietor of a district to the Police Department on forms
provided by the Police Department. The application for a permit shall
contain information to verify that the applicant is a bona fide resident of
the district for which application has been made and has legal title to or
the right to possession of the motor vehicle to be permitted. The
information shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Applicant's name, address, operator's permit number and date of
issuance.
(2) Vehicle owner's name, address, operator's permit number and date
of issuance.
(3) The make, model, color, state of registration and license number of
the vehicle to be registered.
B. A parking permit may not be issued for any motor vehicle for which one
or more unpaid citations have been issued by the Borough for parking

§ 256-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is:
§ 256-2. Applicability.
This article shall apply to all premises served by the public water supply
system of the Borough of Tarentum.
§ 256-3. Policy.
The public water supplier and the consumer have the joint responsibility
for protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to
backflow of contaminants through the water service connection. If in the
judgment of the public water supplier or his authorized representative an
approved backflow prevention device is required, the supplier shall give
notice to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention device
at each service connection to his premises. The consumer shall immediately
install such approved device or devices at his own expense, and failure,
refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install such device or
devices shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the
premises until such device or devices have been installed.
§ 256-4. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the following words shall have the meanings
indicated unless clearly indicated otherwise in the text:
AIR GAP SEPARATION  The unobstructed vertical distance through the
free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying potable water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the
flood level rim of the receptacle. The differential distance shall be at least
A. To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants
or pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into
the public water supply system.
B. To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable water
system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources
or system containing process fluids.
C. To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection
control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's potable water
system.

double the diameter (2 x D) of the supply pipe, measured vertically above
the top of the rim of the vessel. In no case shall the air gap be less than one
inch.
APPROVED  A backflow prevention device or method has been accepted
by the public water supplier as suitable for the proposed use.
ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER (ALSO KNOWN AS THE "NONPRESSURE-
TYPE VACUUM BREAKER")  A device containing a shutoff
valve followed by a valve body containing a float-check, a check seat and an
air inlet port. When the shutoff valve is open, the flow of water causes the
float to close the air inlet port. When the shutoff valve is closed, the float
falls and forms a check valve against backsiphonage and at the same time
opens the air inlet port.
AUXILIARY WATER SYSTEM  Any water source or system on the premises
of or available to the customer except connections to other approved city
water supply system.
BACKFLOW  A flow condition, induced by a differential in pressure, that

customer source into a public water supply system main due to a temporary
negative or subatmospheric pressure within the public water supply system.
CONSUMER  The owner or person in control of any premises supplied by
or in any manner connected to a public water supply system.
CONSUMER'S WATER SYSTEM  Any water system, located on the
consumer's premises, supplied by or in any manner connected to a public
water supply system. A household plumbing system is considered to be a
consumer's water system.
CONTAINMENT  Cross-connection control which isolates the customer's
entire facility from the public water supply system so as to provide the
protection necessary to prevent contamination of the public water supply in
the event of backflow from the customer's facility.
CONTAMINATION  The degradation of the quality of the drinking water
by wastewaters, processed fluids or any water of a quality less than
accepted drinking water quality to a degree which would create an actual
hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of
disease.
CROSS-CONNECTION  An arrangement allowing either a direct or
indirect connection through which backflow, including backsiphonage, can
§ 256-4 TARENTUM CODE § 256-4
256:380
occur between the drinking water in a public water system and a system
containing a source or potential source of contamination.

federal or state government. The term includes the officers, employees and
agents of any partnership, association, company, corporation, municipality,
municipal authority, political subdivision or any agency of federal or state
government.
POLLUTION  The presence in water of any foreign substance that tends
to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness
or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard
to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such
waters for domestic use.
POTABLE WATER  Water which is satisfactory for drinking, culinary and
domestic purposes and meets the requirements of the Department of
Environmental Protection.
PROCESS FLUIDS  Any fluid or solution which may be chemically,

(a) The communications company is required to demonstrate,
using technological evidence, that the antenna must go where
it is proposed in order to satisfy its function in the company's
grid system.
(2) If the communications company proposes to build a tower (as
opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing structure), it is
required to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall
structures within a one-quarter-mile radius of the site proposed,

stealth towers include a tower which looks like a tree or a clock
§ 265-502 TARENTUM CODE § 265-502
256:446
tower, or one which is concealed in a church steeple or concrete
silo.

as much of the support structure as possible, the fence surrounding
the support structure, and any other ground level features (such as
a building), and in general soften the appearance of the cell site.
Tarentum Borough may permit any combination of existing
vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features
instead of landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of
screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted
on an existing structure, and other equipment is housed inside an
existing structure, landscaping shall not be required.
(9) An evergreen screen shall be required to surround the site. The
screen can be either a hedge (planted three feet on center
maximum) or a row of evergreen trees (planted 10 feet on center
maximum). The evergreen screen shall be a minimum height of six
feet at planting, and shall grow to a minimum of 15 feet at maturity.
(10) In addition, existing vegetation on and around the site shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
(11) In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures
needed in the community in the future, the proposed support
structure shall be required to accommodate other users, including
other communications companies, and local police, fire, ambulance
services and Borough authority and road departments. In addition,
§ 265-502 WATER § 265-502
256:447
a linear two-mile separation shall be maintained between
communications towers, measured from the base of the support
structure.
(12) The communications company must demonstrate that it is licensed
by the Federal Communications Commission.
(13) Antenna support structures should be painted silver or have a
galvanized finish retained, in order to reduce the visual impact.
Support structures may be painted green up to the height of nearby
trees. Support structures near airports shall meet all Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation, Bureau of Aviation and Federal
Aviation Administration regulations. No antenna support structure
may be artificially lighted except as provided for and required by
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Aviation
and FAA.
(14) A plan shall be required for all cell sites showing the antenna,
antenna support structure, building, fencing, buffering, and access
to public rights-of-way. The plan shall not be required if the antenna
is to be mounted on an existing structure.
(15) In granting the use, Borough Council may attach reasonable
conditions warranted to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, including, but not limited to, location, fencing, screening,
increased setbacks and the right to use said facilities for public
purposes.
(16) All approvals will be only for specific facilities set forth in the
application. No additions or alterations thereto, other than colocation
which meets all associated setbacks, will be permitted
without a new application and accompanying conditional use
approval.
K. Mobile home parks.

ARTICLE VI
Traditional Neighborhood Development
The Traditional Neighborhood Development TND is established in order to
promote forms of mixed use development that complement the Borough's
traditional business district and meet the objective of traditional
neighborhood development by integrating open space, providing
pedestrian connections between varieties of uses and providing a variety
of housing choices for current and expected residents. Development, to
the extent possible, should meet the design guidelines prepared by the
Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, attached as an appendix to
this chapter.123
§ 265-601. Objectives.
The objectives of the Traditional Neighborhood Development District are as
follows:
§ 265-602. Applicability to other Borough ordinances.
A. To establish or encourage the continuation of the traditional
commercial downtown that are pedestrian-oriented with connections to
parks, a centrally located public or semipublic commons, square, plaza,
park or prominent intersection of two or more major streets,
commercial enterprises and civic and other public buildings and
facilities for social activity, recreation and community functions;
B. To minimize traffic congestion and reduce the need for extensive road
construction by reducing the number and length of automobile trips
required to access everyday needs;
C. To provide the elderly and the young with independence of movement
by locating daily activities within walking distance;
D. To foster the ability of citizens to come to know each other and to watch
over their mutual security by providing public spaces such as streets,
parks and squares and mixed use which maximizes the proximity to
neighbors at almost all times of the day; and
E. To promote the provision of adequate housing and housing options to
the current and expected range of residents;
F. To facilitate economic viability for small commercial establishments
through shared parking, services, pedestrian access, and
complementary businesses; and
G. To encourage preservation of open space, environmentally sensitive
areas, and historic assets.
123. Editor's Note: Said appendix is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 265-601 WATER § 265-602
256:455
§ 265-603. Open space and public areas.
A. Unless expressly modified by provisions of this article, all Borough
ordinances including but not limited to subdivision and land
development, erosion and sedimentation, grading, street construction
standards, and stormwater shall apply to subdivisions and land
developments approved in accordance with this article and compliance
with the aforesaid shall serve as a prerequisite or requirement of
traditional neighborhood development approval.
B. Where conflicts occur between the standards of this article and the
aforementioned Borough ordinances, the standards of this article,
whether greater or lesser, shall prevail.
C. Where a finally approved traditional neighborhood development is
recorded and properly filed with the Allegheny County Recorder of
Deeds Office, all portions of the zoning ordinance and subdivision
ordinance otherwise applicable to the land shall cease to apply thereto.
A. Where a TND involves construction of 20,000 square feet or more of
space, calculated by the sum of the gross floor area of all commercial
establishments and 1,200 square feet per dwelling unit proposed, open
space shall be required as follows:
(1) A minimum of 25% of the site area shall be preserved as open
space. Where the base zoning of the respective district is R-1, 40%
of the site shall be preserved as open space. Where the site is
proposed to be under the control of one property owner and no
subdivision or condominium is proposed, required open space may
be designated on the plat. Otherwise, open space shall be shown by
easement or parcel with applicable covenants.
(2) Environmentally sensitive areas such as jurisdictional wetlands,
steep slopes, floodplains, and riparian buffers shall be preserved as
passive open space and may incorporate trails where feasible.
(3) Unless the TND acts as infill within an area of existing
development, passive open space shall be distributed around the
perimeter of the site.
(4) A minimum of 5% of the site area shall be dedicated as centralized
active open space or spaces that meet the following design
objectives:
(a) Provide active open space suitable for use by residents and/or
patrons or members of establishments or institutions within
the TND or the public at large.
(b) Facilitate interaction of pedestrians and focused social activity
for the mutual benefit, support, and security of neighborhoods
and establishments within the TND through installation of
§ 265-602 TARENTUM CODE § 265-603
256:456
sidewalks, trails, street furniture such as park benches,
gazebos, and uniform styles of lighting and landscaping.
(c) Centralized active open space shall be bounded by street
rights-of-way on at least two sides.
B. Common open space shall be maintained, through covenants, by an
association comprised of landowners including condominium
associations and homeowners associations which shall perpetually
maintain the open space which may not be conveyed to a private third
party.
C. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any time
after establishment of the TND fail to maintain the common open space
in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the development
plan, the Borough may serve written notice upon such organization or
upon the residents of the TND setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand that such
deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within 30 days thereof, and
shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held
within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing the Borough may modify
the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an
extension of time within which they shall be corrected.
D. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modifications
thereof shall not be corrected within said 30 days or any extension
thereof, the Borough, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the TND and to prevent the common open space from
becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common open space
and maintain the same for a period of one year. Said maintenance by the
Borough shall not constitute a taking of said common open space, nor
vest in the public any rights to use the same.
E. Before the expiration of said year, the Borough shall, upon its initiative
or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing upon
notice to such organization, or to the residents or owner(s) of the TND,
to be held by the Borough Council, at which hearing such organization
or the residents of the TND shall show cause why such maintenance by
the Borough shall not, at the option of the Borough, continue for a
succeeding year. If the Borough Council shall determine that such
organization is ready and able to maintain said common open space in
reasonable condition, the Borough shall cease to maintain said common
open space at the end of said year. If the Borough Council shall
determine that such organization is not ready and able to maintain said
common open space in a reasonable condition, the Borough may, in its
discretion, continue to maintain said common open space during the
next succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing and
determination, in each year thereafter.

the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of lien in the office of the
Prothonotary of Allegheny County, upon the properties affected by the
lien within the TND.

the base district, the number of units by type of unit permitted in the
TND shall be proportional to the respective minimum lot size or area
required per such dwelling.
B. Where the base district is an R or residentially zoned district, uses
authorized as conditional uses in said districts may be incorporated into
the TND. Such uses, upon receiving requisite conditional use approval,

of the lot and number of spaces credited per establishment shall be
determined at the time of tentative approval. Easements or fee simple
ownership through an association shall be executed or established.
D. Sidewalks. Sidewalks should be installed in accordance with Borough
construction standards. Sidewalks on blocks primarily serving
nonresidential establishments shall promote pedestrian traffic between
such establishments and from parking and common areas to the

landscaping requirements shall apply. The purpose of the following
requirements is to:
(1) Promote tree planting and screening requirements that are an
integral part of traditional neighborhood development guidelines;
(2) Protect property values by providing landscape buffering as a
transition between districts and uses of varying intensities.
(3) Ensure installation and maintenance of landscaping and vegetation
in new residential neighborhoods, commercial centers, and mixeduse
developments in order to minimize effects of heat associated
with paved areas, provide for shade, minimize erosion, and provide
for functional integration with existing neighborhoods and
commercial centers.
(4) Landscaping shall be used in all open areas not covered by
buildings, required parking areas, sidewalks or other impervious
surfaces. Landscaping shall be a mixture of shade tree, low-level
planting and ground cover that shall be of a type, size and
placement compatible with the land development and the
surrounding land uses.

effective subdivision and land development ordinance, conditional
use applications, and traditional neighborhood development
applications shall include a landscaping plan, prepared and sealed
by a landscape architect duly registered to prepare said plans in
and by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(2) Completion of landscaping. Prior to the issuance of any building
permit by the Borough, a bond or other cash security in the amount
of 110% of an approved estimate of the required landscaping
improvements shall be submitted to the Borough. An occupancy
permit shall not be issued until all required landscaping
improvements are installed and verified by a registered landscape
architect. In the event that all of the required landscaping
improvements cannot be installed at the time of request for an
occupancy permit due to the loss of the planting season, a
temporary occupancy permit may be granted for a period not
longer than nine months to allow for landscaping improvements to
be installed during the next planting season.
(3) Where a decision is required by Council for conditional use or
traditional neighborhood development approval and financial

specified ratio, e.g., for commercial parking high activity, the
average footcandles shall not be in excess of 3.6, i.e. (0.9 x 4).
B. Lighting fixture design.
(1) For lighting of horizontal surfaces such as roadways, pathways and
parking areas, fixtures shall meet IESNA full-cutoff criteria.
(2) For lighting of nonhorizontal surfaces such as the use of
floodlighting, spotlighting, wall-mounted fixtures, decorative
globes and other fixtures not meeting IESNA full-cutoff criteria
shall be remitted only with glare control and notwithstanding the
required uniformity ratio.

of the intent to take such a vote. A hearing shall be held in connection
with the vote if the member shall request it in writing within the
aforementioned time period.
C. The Board shall elect from its own membership its officers, who shall
serve annual terms as such and may succeed themselves. For the

procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption which challenges shall be raised by an
appeal taken within 30 days after the effective date of said

been previously established, the appeal raising procedural
questions shall be taken directly to court.
(3) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including,
but not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to
act on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist

the applicant receives at least seven hours of hearings within the 100
days, including the first hearing. Persons opposed to the application
shall complete the presentation of their opposition to the application
within 100 days of the first hearing held after the completion of the
applicant's case-in-chief. An applicant may, upon request, be granted
additional hearings to complete his case-in-chief provided the persons
opposed to the application are granted an equal number of additional
hearings. Persons opposed to the application may, upon the written
consent or consent on the record by the applicant and municipality,
be granted additional hearings to complete their opposition to the
application provided the applicant is granted an equal number of
additional hearings for rebuttal.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board shall conduct the hearings or the Zoning
Hearing Board may appoint any member or an independent attorney as
a hearing officer. The decision, or, where no decision is called for, the
findings shall be made by the Zoning Hearing Board; however, the
appellant or the applicant, as the case may be, in addition to the
Borough Council, may, prior to the decision of the hearing, waive
decision or findings by the Zoning Hearing Board and accept the
decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
E. The chairman or acting chairman of the Zoning Hearing Board or the
hearing officer presiding shall have power to administer oaths and issue
subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of
relevant documents and papers, including witnesses and documents

application is contested or denied, each decision shall be accompanied
by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together with the
reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of the MPC or of
any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the
provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed
appropriate in the light of the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by
a hearing officer and there has been no stipulation that his decision or
findings are final, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make his report and
recommendations available to the parties within 45 days and the
parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon to the
Zoning Hearing Board prior to final decision or entry of findings, and
the Zoning Hearing Board's decision shall be entered no later than 30
days after the report of the hearing officer. Excepting validity
challenges, where the Zoning Hearing Board fails to render the
decision within the period required by this subsection or fails to
commence or complete the required hearing as provided herein, the
decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the
applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to
an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the
applicant because of the failure of the Zoning Hearing Board to meet or
render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall give public notice of said decision within 10 days from the last day
it could have met to render a decision in the same manner as provided
in Subsection (1) of this section. If the Zoning Hearing Board shall fail
to provide such notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing in this
subsection shall prejudice the right of any party opposing the
application to appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
L. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the
findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him
not later than the day following its date. To all other persons who have
filed their name and address with the Zoning Hearing Board not later

The Zoning Hearing Board shall have exclusive power to hear appeals for
dimensional and use variances from the provisions of this chapter.
decisions to all applicable parties, and other files which shall remain
the property of the Borough Council.
A. The landowner shall submit an application to the Zoning Officer
including a survey showing existing structures and the location and
detail of the proposed activity or structure for which the applicant
requires a variance; the required fee for a variance as outlined in the
fee schedule or schedules of the Borough Council and a completed
application with all required contact information as well as additional
information, if any, required by the Board.
B. The Board shall grant a variance only when findings of fact are
supported by all of the following where relevant in a given case and
therefore constitute an unnecessary hardship inflicted by this chapter.
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
this chapter in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
C. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter.
§ 265-1403 TARENTUM CODE § 265-1405

detail of the proposed activity or structure for which the applicant
requires the special exception, including representations of parking
and circulation; the required fee for the special exception fee as
outlined in the schedule or schedules of the Borough Council, and a
completed application with all required contact information as well as
additional information, if any, required by the Board.
C. Special exceptions for nonconforming uses shall be evaluated by the
following criteria at a minimum.
(1) The impact of any proposed use on the neighborhood of which it is
a part compared with the impact of the existing nonconforming
use. A proposed use shall not present a greater adverse impact as
compared with the existing use.
(2) The impact of an expansion of the nonconforming use and the
manner in which the expansion changes or redefines the impact of
the current nonconforming use.
(3) The extent to which a proposed expansion changes the scale of use
such that the use itself may be changed such that it does not
present an adverse impact on the neighborhood and district in
which it is located. The expansion shall be considered a natural
outgrowth necessary to the economic vitality and sustainability of
the current nonconforming use.
(4) The consistency of any proposed expansion with the current
character of a neighborhood or district.
(5) The change in parking required and traffic circulation associated
with any proposed expansion or change in use.
D. In granting any special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter.
E. Proposed additions shall conform dimensionally and otherwise to the
standards of the present ordinance, or shall otherwise require a
dimensional variance.

initial adoption based on procedural defects associated with the
adoption process.
A. Where a landowner desires to challenge the validity of the chapter in
regards to the application of the ordinance to a property within the
Borough either under his ownership or other than his own, the
landowner shall submit an application for a validity challenge to the
Zoning Officer. The application shall include the section of chapter, of
which validity is challenged, the property to which the challenge
relates, the landowner's basis for challenge, and proposals by the

upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map.
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,

Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "Comcast"), a Pennsylvania corporation,
its successors and assigns, for a period of 15 years from the date hereof,
to erect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities for reception,
transmission and distribution of radio and television signals and audio,
visual, electric or electronic signals or impulses by any feasible
equipment within the Borough of Tarentum, Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania (hereinafter referred to as "borough"), and any extension
or expansion thereof and to locate, construct, renew, maintain, replace
and operate the facilities required therefor, in, on, under, over, along,
across and upon the streets, sidewalks, alleys, bridges, highways and
other public ways or places in the borough. At the expiration of 15
years, this franchise shall continue from year to year unless 90 days
prior to the expiration of any term either the borough or Comcast shall
notify the other party in writing that there shall be no further renewal.
These rights shall be exercised in accordance with the laws of the
Unites States of America, of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
the ordinances, rules and regulations as shall be established from time
to time by the borough, as well as in conformity with rights presently
enjoyed by such utilities as the same now exist in the borough.
B. There is hereby further granted to Comcast, its successors and assigns,
subject to ordinances, rules and regulations of the borough, the right,
privilege and authority to lease, rent or in any other manner obtain the
use of towers, poles, lines, cables and other equipment and facilities
from any and all holders of public licenses or franchises within or
partially within the borough and to use such towers, poles, lines, cables
and other equipment and facilities. It is the intention that all other
holders of public licenses and franchises within the borough shall
cooperate with Comcast to allow Comcast's joint usage of their
equipment and facilities whenever possible and wherever such usage
does not interfere with the normal operation of such holders of public
licenses and franchises so that the equipment and facilities constructed
by Comcast may be minimized.
C. All equipment and facilities of Comcast with this borough may also be
used for the reception, transmission and distribution of radio and
television signals and audio, visual, electronic or electric signals or
impulses to or from areas outside of the borough.

§ A271-2. Equipment and facilities.
§ A271-3. Use of poles; indemnification.

correct the areas of noncompliance in accordance with the procedures
set forth in § A271-11.
A. All equipment and facilities installed by Comcast pursuant hereto shall
be located, erected and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere
with the lives of persons or to interfere with any new improvements the

obstruct the free use of the streets, sidewalks, alleys, bridges, highways
and other public ways or public places of the borough and shall be in
accordance with the ordinances, rules, regulations as shall be
established from time to time by the borough.
B. All installations shall be of a permanent, durable nature and shall be
installed in accordance with good engineering practices and shall
comply with all existing and future regulations, ordinances and laws so

owners or other licenses and public utilities.
C. In the event Comcast is required to open or disturb any pavement,
sidewalk or surface, Comcast shall, at its own expense and only in the
manner approved by the borough, replace and restore all pavement,
sidewalks or surfaces so disturbed to as good condition as before said
work commenced and shall do so only under rules and regulations as
shall be established from time to time by the borough.
D. No equipment or facilities shall be erected by Comcast upon any
streets, sidewalks, alleys, bridges, highways or public ways or places
under the jurisdiction of the borough unless permission is first obtained
from the designated official of the borough in accordance with
ordinances, rules, regulations as shall be established from time to time
by the borough; provided, however, that such permission shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
E. In the event that a change is made in the grade of public streets,

which shall necessitate the removal or relocation of any equipment or
facilities of Comcast, Comcast shall make such changes in its facilities
at its own expense.

with Comcast's specifications.
B. The borough shall indemnify and hold harmless Comcast from all
claims, demands, actions, judgments, costs, expenses, liabilities and
damages of any kind whatsoever arising out of the use by the borough

and against losses and physical damage to property and bodily injury or
death to persons, including payments made under any workmen's
compensation law, which may arise out of or be caused by the erection,
maintenance, presence, use or removal of Comcast's equipment or
facilities within the borough or by any act of Comcast, its agent,
employees and shall carry insurance in the above-described amounts to
protect the borough from and against all claims, demands, actions,
judgments, costs, expenses, liabilities and damages arising or resulting
directly or indirectly from or by reason of such loss, injury or damage.
Comcast shall also indemnify, protect and save harmless the borough
from any and all claims in law or in equity that the franchise herein
granted is illegally granted by the borough and shall pay all legal
expenses incurred by the borough in defending any claim that the
borough acted illegally in granting the franchise.
C. All insurance required shall be and remain in full force and effect for
the entire life of the rights granted hereunder. Said policy or policies of
insurance shall be approved by the Solicitor for the borough and the

any other license tax or similar inspection fees.
B. Comcast shall file with the borough by the 20th day of the month
following the close of each quarter a statement showing the
subscription receipts as defined herein. The borough shall have the
right at any reasonable time to inspect the books of Comcast relative to

borough shall not make public disclosure of any information gained as a
result of such inspection without prior written consent of Comcast.

municipal building and fire hall within the service area, making no

subject to the terms and conditions herein imposed, such assignment to
become effective only upon the assignee's filing with the borough a written
acceptance of the rights and privileges hereby granted, subject to the terms
and conditions herein imposed.
§ A271-9. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
ordinance is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct
and independent provision and such holdings shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portions herein.
§ A271-10. Maintenance of system.
Comcast will keep the system free of interference to television receivers
and will provide all the necessary precautions to prevent interference; and
in compliance with this ordinance, will repair and maintain the system in a
trouble-free condition at no cost or charge to the subscriber or the borough.
§ A271-11. Failure to comply.
A. Should Comcast at any time fail to comply with any of the material
terms and provisions of this franchise, the Borough Secretary shall
notify Comcast in writing, setting the nature and fact of such
noncompliance as she believes has occurred. If, within 30 days
following receipt of such written notification, Comcast has not
furnished evidence that corrective action has been commenced and is
being actively pursued or evidence that the alleged default did not
occur, the Borough Secretary shall give written notice of not less than
20 days of a public hearing to be held before the Borough Council. Said
notice shall specify the violations alleged to have occurred.
B. If, after considering the Borough Secretary's request for termination of
the franchise and hearing all interested parties, the Council determines
that material violation has not occurred, the proceedings shall
terminate. If the Council determines that the noncompliance of
Comcast was with just cause, it shall direct Comcast to cure the default
within a reasonable time.
C. In the event the Council determines that material violations exist and
that Comcast has not corrected the same or has not commenced and is
