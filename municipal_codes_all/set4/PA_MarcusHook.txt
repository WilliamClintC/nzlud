Police Services Recovery of Costs
[Adopted 11-1-1999 by Ord. No. O-99-3; approved 11-1-1999]
§ 37-19. Purpose and intent.
§ 37-20. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
OWNER  The person or persons or corporation or other entity comprising
record owner or owners of any land or building.
POLICE SERVICE COSTS  An amount fixed by Borough Council to cover
estimated compensation of officers for amount of time normally spent in
A. The Borough Council of the Borough of Marcus Hook finds and
determines:
(1) That certain private properties require a disproportionate amount
of police service with many calls requiring response to maintain
order and public peace and to stop public disturbances so that
there is less police personnel and resources available for other
locations, emergencies and duties in the Borough, and
extraordinary police service at such properties puts a
disproportionate and unfair burden upon the citizens and taxpayers
of the Borough.
(2) That owners and/or rental agents in charge of such private
properties derive a benefit from such police service.
(3) That the owners and/or rental agents in charge of such private
properties have a responsibility to manage their properties to
minimize required police service to maintain order and public
peace and to stop public disturbances and to minimize the burden
upon citizens and taxpayers of the Borough and to promote the
health, safety and welfare of the public in general.
(4) That the owners and/or rental agents in charge of such private
properties can minimize required police service to maintain order
and public peace and to stop public disturbances by diligent and
strict management and regulation of their properties.
(5) That assessment of costs as provided in this article is reasonable
and will have a deterrent effect and encourage more responsible
management of such properties.
B. It is not the intent of this article to discourage or suppress requests for
police service, but rather to encourage and stimulate diligent and strict
management and regulation of private property by owners and/or
rental agents in charge.
§ 37-19 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 37-20
37:37
responding to a call or otherwise maintaining order and public peace and
stopping disturbances, appropriate administrative costs allocable thereto,
and medical treatment to injured officers and the cost of repairing damaged
Borough equipment or property. This amount shall be fixed from time to

are, for the purpose of this section, unsafe. Any use of buildings or
structures constituting a hazard to safety, health or public welfare
by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire
hazard, disaster, damage or abandonment are, for the purpose of this
section, unsafe uses. Parapet walls, cornices, spires, towers, tanks,
statuary and other appendages or structural members which are
supported by, attached to or a part of a building and which are in
deteriorated condition or otherwise unable to sustain the design loads

of a summary offense.

pursuant to this chapter has become final, the person to whom such
order is directed shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey such order,
the code official may cause such person to be prosecuted for a
summary offense or institute any appropriate action to abate such
building as a public nuisance.
3. Failure to commence work. Whenever the required repair or
demolition is not commenced within the stipulated time or 30 days
after any final notice and order issued under this chapter becomes
effective:
(a) The code official shall cause the building described in such
notice and order to be vacated by posting at each entrance
thereto a notice reading: "Unsafe Building. Do Not Occupy. It
Is a Summary Offense To Occupy This Building or To Remove
or Deface This Notice. Code Official, Borough of Marcus
Hook."
§ 76-3 BILLBOARDS AND ADVERTISING § 76-3
70:87
(b) No person shall occupy any building which has been posted as
specified in this subsection. No person shall remove or deface
any such notice so posted until the repairs, demolition or
removal ordered by the code official have been completed and

the provisions of the BOCA Building Code Section 118.1.
(c) The Code Official may, in addition to any other remedy herein
provided, cause the building to be repaired to the extent
necessary to correct the defect or, if the notice and order
required demolition, cause the building to be demolished and
the materials, rubble and debris therefor removed and the lot
cleaned.
The cost of such repairs, improvements or vacating and
closing, removal or demolition shall be placed as a municipal
lien against the real property upon which the cost was
incurred. If the structure is removed or demolished by the
order of the Code Official, he shall sell the materials of such
structure for the best price attainable and shall credit the
proceeds of such sale against the cost of removal or
demolition. Any surplus realized from the demolition of any
such building over and above the cost of demolition and
cleaning the lot shall be paid over to the person or persons
lawfully entitled thereto.
(d) Extension of time to perform work. Upon receipt of an
application from the person required to conform to the order
and an agreement by such person that he will comply with
the order if allowed additional time, the code official may,
at his discretion, grant an extension of time, not to exceed
an additional 60 days, within which to complete said repair,
rehabilitation or demolition if the code official determines
such an extension of time will not create or perpetuate a
situation imminently dangerous to life or property. An
additional 60 days may be granted at the discretion of the
Building Code Board of Appeals.
4. Abatement of unsafe buildings. All buildings or portions thereof
which are determined after inspection by the code official to be
unsafe as defined in this chapter are hereby declared to be public
nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition
or removal in accordance with the following standards or as
otherwise provided in this chapter:
(a) If the unsafe building, whether or not vacant, can reasonably
be repaired so that it will no longer exist in violation of the
terms of this chapter, it shall be ordered to be repaired in
accordance with the current Building Code.

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 99-4.01. Identification.
§ 99-4.02. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Borough of Marcus Hook, classified as Special Flood
Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
September 2, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study; and
(2) Any community-identified Flood Hazard Areas.
B. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Borough of Marcus Hook and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those Special Flood Hazard Areas where no floodway
has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.

Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which
base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more
than one foot at any point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
(1) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
D. Community-identified Flood Hazard Areas shall be those areas where
Borough of Marcus Hook has identified local flood hazard or ponding
areas, as delineated and adopted on a Local Flood Hazard Map using
best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.

96:140
§ 99-4.03. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the Special Flood Hazard Area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the Special Flood Hazard Area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 99-5.01B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 99-4.04. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 99-4.05. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

§ 157-31. Purpose.
The Borough finds that the presence of graffiti on public and private
property within the Borough can result in the aesthetic deterioration of
neighborhoods and commercial areas, creates blight and, if not properly
abated, may lead to further placement of graffiti. The purpose of this article
is to establish rules and procedures for graffiti removal and to address the
cost of such removal.
§ 157-32. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrase, when used in this article, shall have
the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning.

§ 157-33. Prohibition against graffiti.
No person may apply or attempt to apply graffiti on any property, real
or personal, where it will be visible by the public. All persons directly
or indirectly involved in applying, attempting to apply, or assisting in the
application of graffiti shall be equally responsible along with the individual
or individuals who personally applied or attempted to apply the graffiti. A
person assists in the application of graffiti if he or she knowingly provides
or makes available the tools, writing materials, or ladders used to apply the
graffiti or acts as a lookout during the application.
Any inscription, word, symbol, figure, marking or design, that is
marked, etched, scrawled, stained, drawn or painted and stuck on

express permission of the owner or owner's agent of such property,
including but not limited to: any wall, underpass, overpass, trestle, tree,
sign, pole, playground apparatus, utility box, building, structure, fixture
or other improvements whether permanent or temporary, regardless
of the content or nature of the material that has been applied, and
which is visible from any public property or the public right-of-way, or

any person for the purpose of having said spray paint container or indelible
marker or other materials used in violation of any of the provisions of this
article.
§ 157-35. Prohibition against allowing graffiti to remain.
No property owner, occupant, lessee, lessor, renter, tenant or person
otherwise in charge or control of any property within the Borough shall

the defaced surface.

and blends in with the existing surface. In the event property owner,
occupant, lessee, lessor, renter, tenant or person otherwise in charge or
control of any property in the Borough shall fail or refuse to remove
graffiti from his property, or to cover up the graffiti with a color that
matches and blends in with the existing surface, then the Borough's
Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her designated agent, may cause
written notice to be served upon the property owner, occupant, lessee,
lessor, renter, tenant or person otherwise in charge or control of any
property requesting removal or covering up of the graffiti. Notice shall
be deemed received upon personal service, or 48 hours after being
deposited in the United States mail, first class, postage prepaid,
directed to the intended individual or upon posting the notice upon the
property.
B. If such property owner, occupant, lessee, lessor, renter, tenant or
person otherwise in charge or control of any property fails to remove
the graffiti within seven days after receipt of the notice requesting
removal of the graffiti, the graffiti may be removed by the Borough. All
costs of the removal or abatement work shall be billed to the owner of
the property and, if unpaid after 60 days, shall be forwarded to the
Borough Solicitor for the collection of the unpaid costs with interest
from the time of completion of the work needed to eliminate the graffiti.
Such collection action may be by a lien against the property, filed and
collected in the same manner as a municipal claim.

the Borough's expense, and the owner of the property consents to such

thereof, be punishable for each offense by a fine of up to the maximum

(a) The amounts of any federal, state or private grants to be
received during or applicable to said year relating to any such
said costs; and

agreements with such municipalities, the proportionate share of such
total costs which is chargeable to such other municipalities for their
shares of the said costs of the portions of the Borough system used by
other municipalities.
A. The annual service charge shall be on a unit basis, the annual amount
or rate per unit to be determined by dividing the total amount of costs
as determined under the provisions of § 167-11 hereby by the total
number of units in the Borough. The Borough shall annually adopt a
resolution which shall compute the total amount of service charges to
be collected, the total number of units in the Borough and the amount
or rate per unit to be charged for said year.54

based on 250 gallons per day constituting one unit; provided,
however, that if the strength of said discharge exceeds 300 parts
per million of BOD5 and/or 300 parts per million of suspended
solids, then the said establishment shall be subject to a surcharge
determined in accordance with the provisions relating to industrial
users.
(12) Self-service laundries or a laundry business using individual
washers of ordinary size shall be charged on the basis of one unit
for each two machines. Any odd number shall be charged as one

flats, apartments, stores, shops, offices or business or industrial
units, or two or more families using separate cooking and/or
bathroom facilities in one dwelling, have the use of the sewer
system through one sewer lateral, each and every such dwelling
unit, household, flat, apartment, store, shop, office or business or

§ 167-13. Rates for industrial users.
(17) Wherever a rate is based totally or partially upon the number of
pupils, patients or employees, including teachers and operating
personnel, a unit shall be computed and based upon the daily
average number of pupils, patients or employees for the full
calendar year immediately preceding the date of annual or partial
billing. The daily average number for new establishments shall be
estimated by the Borough and adjusted for the subsequent billing.
(18) Any establishment or property user may be classified by the
Borough on a comparative or equitable basis in all cases where the
classification overlaps or is not clearly applicable, and the user
shall be notified of his new or adjusted or determined classification.

(20) In any case in which the above rules are not exactly applicable, the
Borough shall fix applicable rates with the same force and effect as
if set forth herein.
C. On or before January 31 of each year, the owner of every hotel,
apartment hotel, boarding school or college, day school or college,
church, hospital, nursing home, public building, building used for
municipal purposes, library, self-service laundry, commercial user and
industrial user shall submit to the Borough, on forms supplied by the
Borough, setting forth the information required by the Borough to
determine the respective number of units to be charged, calculated in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection B hereof. If any such user
fails to provide such information by said date, the Borough will estimate
the number of units to be charged to said user and the decision of the
Borough will be final and binding for the current year.
A. The annual service charge for industrial users shall be based on water
use and the actual biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended
solids (SS) concentration of the industrial discharge. The water use,
BOD and SS data shall be converted to equivalent units by the formula
presented in Subsection B.
B. The industrial units shall be calculated as follows:
§ 167-12 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 167-13
162:297
Where
IU = Industry's units.
AWU = Industry's annual water use (gallons).
A = Proportion of Borough's cost attributable to wastewater
flow.
B = Proportion of Borough's cost attributable to BOD
strength.
C = Proportion of Borough's cost attributable to SS strength.
* NOTE: Where these figures are less than 300 mg/l per liter in
BOD or SS, the value in parenthesis shall be equal to one.
C. The specific values for A, B and C shall be established annually by the
Borough based on actual expenses incurred by the Borough in
providing wastewater collection, conveyance and treatment service by
the Borough and DELCORA. For 1978 these values shall be established
as follows:
A = 0.7
B = 0.0
C = 0.3
D. Each industrial user shall furnish representative wastewater
characteristic reports conducted by a certified testing laboratory
acceptable to the Borough on a quarterly basis. The Borough shall
furnish the report form to the industry. The Borough shall request more
frequent reporting for specific industries which exhibit significant
variations in waste strength.
E. The Borough reserves the right to conduct independent wastewater
characteristics analyses to verify industry reports. The Borough shall
use its analyses results in cases where there are significant
discrepancies between industry reports and the Borough's analysis.
F. Annual water use data shall be obtained from the Chester Water
Authority records in cases where the industry uses Chester Water
Authority. If the industry uses self-supplied water, the industry shall
report its actual water use. In the event the water used by an industry
in any year, as shown by the Chester Water Authority or other records,
exceeds by a substantial amount the total water actually discharged by

the industry into the sewer, the industry may request an adjustment in
the annual water use factor to properly reflect the actual annual flows
discharged to the sewer. In such cases, the industry may at its option
install a meter acceptable to the Borough to measure the wastewater
flows or may establish a fixed ratio to be applied to its water usage by
agreement with the Borough.
A. Upon the demolition of any building or structure connected to the
Borough system, the Borough will, upon application by the owner of the
property, exonerate said premises from payment of further service
charges commencing with January 1 of the year following the year
during which the demolition occurred and continuing as long as said
property remains undeveloped.
B. In the resolution to be adopted each year establishing the annual
service charges, the Borough may exempt from service charges for said
year such types of buildings as it deems just, reasonable and proper.
C. The Borough may, upon application of the owner, exonerate from
payment of service charges any building or structure which has been
vacant for a continuous period of at least six months and is not expected
to be occupied for at least one year during such vacancy. In granting
such exoneration, the Borough may require the owner to disconnect the
connection to the Borough system. Thereafter such building or
structure shall not be reoccupied or reconnected until the owner has
obtained a permit from the Borough or its nominee.
A. Bills for service charges to all Borough users discharging industrial
wastewater into the Borough's system will be submitted to all users
annually on or about the first day of February each year. The annual
bills shall be due and payable upon presentation. Service charges paid
on or before April 1 of the year due shall be subject to a discount of 2%.
Service charges paid after the first day of June of the year due shall be
subject to a penalty of 5%. All service charges not paid on or before
December 31 of the year due shall be deemed to be delinquent and shall
be filed with the Solicitor, who shall proceed to collect delinquent
service charges, together with interest at the rate of 6% per annum on
the amount of the service charge plus penalty and costs accrued
thereon, either by action at law or by filing a lien or liens for the same in
accordance with law.
B. When the annual service charge due from any user is delinquent, the
Borough Council is authorized to request and require the Chester Water
Authority or any other public utility supplier to shut off the water supply
to said premises for neglect or failure to pay said service charges and to
continue said shutoff until said bill has been paid. Prior to requesting
said Chester Water Authority or other public utility supplying water to

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 174-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Marcus Hook Borough Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
§ 174-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces infiltration, and
threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development throughout a watershed can also harm surface
water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns,
accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of
streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
minimization of impacts of development, redevelopment, and activities
causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of
the people of the municipality and all of the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
infiltration for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high
water quality, infiltration, stream baseflow, and aquatic ecosystems.
The most cost-effective and environmentally advantageous way to
manage stormwater runoff is through nonstructural project design that
minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoids sensitive areas (i.e.,
stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and considers topography
and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
§ 174-1 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 174-2
162:309
§ 174-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within the municipality by maintaining the natural hydrologic
regime and minimizing the impacts described in § 174-2 of this chapter
through provisions designed to:
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
G. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
H. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.
A. Promote alternative project designs and layouts that minimize the
impacts on surface and groundwater.
B. Promote nonstructural best management practices (BMPs).
C. Minimize increases in runoff stormwater volume.
D. Minimize impervious surfaces.
E. Manage accelerated stormwater runoff and erosion and sedimentation
problems and stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause these problems.
F. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
G. Utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a
minimum of structures and relying on natural processes.
I. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain base flow, to prevent
degradation of surface and groundwater quality, and to otherwise
protect water resources.
J. Protect base flows and quality of streams and watercourses, where
possible.
K. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pennsylvania Code Chapter 93.4a requiring
protection and maintenance of "existing uses" and maintenance of the
level of water quality to support those uses in all streams, and the

M. Provide standards to meet certain NPDES MS4 permit requirements.
N. Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program that
addresses nonstormwater discharges into the municipality's separate
storm sewer system (MS4).
O. Preserve the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
P. Prevent accelerated scour, erosion and sedimentation of stream
channels.
Q. Provide performance standards and design criteria based on
watershed-wide stormwater management planning.

§ 174-6. Exemptions.
An exemption shall not relieve the applicant from implementing the
requirements of the municipal ordinance or from implementing such
measures as are necessary to protect public health, safety, and property. An
exemption shall not relieve the applicant from complying with the special
requirements for watersheds draining to identified high-quality (HQ) or
exceptional-value (EV) waters or any other current or future state or
municipal water quality protection requirements. If a drainage problem
is documented or known to exist downstream of, or is expected from the
proposed activity, then the municipality may withdraw exemptions listed in
Table 174-6 and require the applicant to comply with all requirements of
this chapter. Even though the applicant is exempt, he is not relieved from
complying with other municipal ordinances or regulations.
structure design, etc.) shall continue to be regulated by the applicable
municipal ordinances and applicable state regulations.
A. General exemptions.
(1) Table 174-6 summarizes the exemptions from certain provisions of
this chapter. Exemptions are for the items noted in Table 174-6
only, and shall not relieve the applicant from other applicable
sections of this chapter.
(2) Any regulated activity that is exempt from some provisions of the
chapter is exempt only from those provisions. If development is to
take place in phases, the developer is responsible for implementing
the requirements of the chapter as the impervious cover/earth
disturbance threshold is met. The date of the municipal ordinance
adoption shall be the starting point from which to consider tracts as
"parent tracts" in which future subdivisions and respective
impervious area and earth disturbance computations shall be
cumulatively considered. Exemption shall not relieve the applicant
from implementing such measures as are necessary to protect
health, safety, and property. For example:
(a) If a property owner proposes a one-hundred-fifty-square-foot
shed after adoption of the municipal stormwater management
ordinance, that property owner would be exempted from water
quality and quantity requirements of the chapter as noted in
Table 174-6 of the chapter. If, at a later date, the property
owner proposes to construct a four-hundred-ninety-ninesquare-
foot room addition, the applicant would be required to
comply with the requirements for the Simplified Method for
the full 649 square feet of impervious cover created since
adoption of the municipal ordinance. If an additional sevenhundred-
square-foot swimming pool/patio is proposed later,
the property owner would be required to implement the full
stormwater quantity and quality control submission
requirements of this chapter for the total 1,349 square feet of
§ 174-5 MARCUS HOOK CODE § 174-6
162:312
additional impervious surface added to the original property
since adoption of the municipal ordinance.

§ 174-10. General requirements.
A. Applicants proposing regulated activities in the municipality which do
not fall under the exemption criteria shown in § 174-6 shall submit a
stormwater management site plan consistent with this chapter and the
applicable watershed stormwater management plan to the municipality
for review. The stormwater management criteria of this chapter shall
apply to the total proposed development even if development is to take
place in stages.
B. No regulated activity within the municipality shall commence until the
municipality issues approval of a SWM plan, which demonstrates
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(1) For any site with proposed regulated earth disturbance equal to or
greater than one acre where, after a close evaluation of alternative
site designs, it proves to be impracticable to meet the mandatory
minimum volume and infiltration control standards of this chapter
onsite, the municipality may approve measures other than those in
this chapter after consultation with and evaluation by PADEP that
the alternate site design meets state water quality requirements
and does not conflict with state law, including, but not limited to,
the Clean Streams Law.67
(2) For any site with proposed regulated earth disturbance that is less
than one acre where, after a close evaluation of alternative site
designs, it proves to be impracticable to meet any one or more of
the mandatory minimum standards of this chapter onsite, the
municipality may approve measures other than those in this
chapter.
(3) "Regulated earth disturbance" is defined to mean any activity
involving earth disturbance subject to regulation under 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 92,68 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102, or the Clean Streams Law.
C. The applicant is required to design the site to minimize surface
discharge of stormwater and the creation of impervious surfaces in
order to maintain, as much as possible, the natural hydrologic regime.
D. The SWM site plan must be designed consistent with the sequencing
provisions of § 174-13 to ensure maintenance of the natural hydrologic
regime, to promote infiltration, and to protect groundwater and surface
water quality and quantity. The SWM site plan designer must proceed
sequentially in accordance with Article III of this chapter.

§ 174-11. Permit requirements by other governmental entities.
The following permit requirements may apply to certain regulated earth
disturbance activities and must be met prior to commencement of regulated
earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
(e) Nonindustrial rooftops.
(f) Pervious areas, except golf courses and nurseries [which may
need an integrated pest management (IPM) plan].
(3) While streets and highways (average daily traffic volume (ADT)
greater than 30,000) are not considered stormwater hotspots, it is
important to ensure that highway stormwater management
facilities are designed to adequately protect receiving streams and/
or groundwater.
(4) The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) NPDES stormwater
program requires some industrial sites to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan.
U. The following standards for protection of downgradient properties from
off-site conveyance must be accomplished: For any location where a
new concentrated discharge of stormwater from any frequency rainfall
event, up to and including the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour

waters of the commonwealth, and maintain as much as possible the natural
hydrologic regime of the site.
A. The applicant shall apply low-impact development (LID) methods such
as those listed in Appendix E,73 provided that use of this method does
not conflict with other local codes.
B. The applicant shall demonstrate that the design process follows the
sequence noted below. The goal of the sequence is to minimize the
increases in stormwater runoff and impacts to water quality resulting
from the proposed regulated activity:
(1) The following items in this subsection shall be addressed prior to
development of other stormwater management site plan design
elements:
(a) Prepare an existing resource and site analysis map (ERSAM)
showing environmentally sensitive areas including, but not
limited to, steep slopes, ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands,
hydric soils, vernal pools, stream buffers, and hydrologic soil
groups. Land development, any existing recharge areas, and
other requirements outlined in the municipal SALDO shall also
be included.
(b) Establish a stream buffer according to § 174-15D.
(c) Prepare a draft project layout avoiding sensitive areas
identified in § 174-13B(1)(a).
(d) Identify site-specific existing conditions drainage areas,
discharge points, recharge areas, and hydrologic soil groups A
and B (areas conducive to infiltration).
(e) Evaluate nonstructural stormwater management alternatives:
[1] Minimize earth disturbance.
[2] Minimize impervious surfaces.
[3] Break up large impervious surfaces.
(f) Determine into what management district the site falls
(chapter Appendix A74), and conduct an existing conditions
runoff analysis.

§ 174-13 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 174-13
162:337
§ 174-14. Infiltration volume requirements.
Providing for infiltration consistent with the natural hydrologic regime
is required. Design of the infiltration facilities shall consider infiltration
to compensate for the reduction in the recharge that occurs when the
ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is created. If it cannot be
physically accomplished, then the design professional shall be responsible
for demonstrating to the satisfaction of the municipality that this cannot
be physically accomplished on the site (e.g., shallow depth to bedrock or
limiting zone, open voids, steep slopes, etc. vs. a financial hardship as
defined in § 174-9). If it can be physically accomplished, the volume of
runoff to be infiltrated shall be determined from § 174-14A(2) depending on
demonstrated site conditions, and shall be the greatest volume that can be
physically infiltrated. For example:
 Any applicant (developer or redeveloper) shall first attempt to infiltrate
the volume required in § 174-14A(2)(a).
 If the § 174-14A(2)(a) requirement cannot be physically accomplished,
then the applicant is required to attempt to infiltrate the volume
required in § 174-14A(2)(b).
 Finally, if the § 174-14A(2)(b) infiltration volume cannot be physically
accomplished, the applicant must, at a minimum, infiltrate the volume
required in § 174-14A(2)(c).
(b) Provide for water quality protection in accordance with
§ 174-15, Water quality requirements.
(c) Provide stream bank erosion protection in accordance with
§ 174-16, Stream bank erosion requirements.
(d) Prepare final project design to maintain existing conditions
drainage areas and discharge points, to minimize earth
disturbance and impervious surfaces, and, to the maximum
extent possible, to ensure that the remaining site development
has no surface or point discharge.
(e) Conduct a proposed conditions runoff analysis based on the
final design that meets the management district requirements
(§ 174-17).
(f) Manage any remaining runoff prior to discharge through
detention, bioretention, direct discharge, or other structural
control.
A. Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(1) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed or
redeveloped areas shall be selected based on suitability of soils and
site conditions and shall be constructed on soils that have the
following characteristics:
§ 174-13 MARCUS HOOK CODE § 174-14
162:338
(a) A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP
and the top of the limiting zone.
(b) An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater volume and dewater completely as determined by
field tests conducted by the applicant's design professional.
(c) The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely draining
the retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) within three days (72
hours) from the end of the design storm.
(2) The size of the infiltration facility and Rev shall be based upon the
following volume criteria:
(a) Modified Control Guideline One (MCG-1) of the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices (PA BMP) Manual.
The retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) to be captured and
infiltrated shall be the net two-year twenty-four-hour volume.
The net volume is the difference between the postdevelopment
runoff volume and the predevelopment runoff volume. The
postdevelopment total runoff volume for all storms equal to or
less than the two-year twenty-four-hour duration precipitation
shall not be increased. For modeling purposes, existing
(predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition or its equivalent, and
20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Infiltrating the entire Rev volume in § 174-14A(2)(a) (above)
may not be feasible on every site due to site-specific limitations
such as shallow depth to bedrock or the water table. If it
cannot be physically accomplished, then the following criteria
from Modified Control Guideline Two (MCG-2) of the
Pennsylvania BMP Manual must be satisfied:
[1] At least the first one inch of runoff from new or
replacement impervious surfaces shall be infiltrated.
Rev = I (inch)* impervious area (square feet) ÷ 12
(inches) = cubic feet (cf)
An asterisk (*) in equations denotes multiplication.
(c) Only if infiltrating the entire Rev volume in § 174-14A(2)(b)
(above) cannot be physically accomplished, then the following
minimum criteria from Modified Control Guideline Two
(MCG-2) of the Pennsylvania BMP Manual must be satisfied:
[1] Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be
designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire water
quality volume (WQv) (§ 174-15B); however, in all cases at
least the first one-half inch of the WQv shall be infiltrated.
§ 174-14 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 174-14
162:339
The minimum infiltration volume (Rev) required would,
therefore, be computed as:
Rev = 1 *impervious area (square feet) ÷ 12 (inches) =
cubic feet (cf)
An asterisk (*) in equations denotes multiplication.
Where:
I = The maximum equivalent infiltration amount (inches)
that the site can physically accept or 0.50 inch, whichever
is greater.
[2] The retention volume values derived from the methods in
§ 174-14A(2)(a), (b) or (c) is the minimum volume the
applicant must control through an infiltration BMP facility.
If site conditions preclude capture of runoff from portions
of the impervious area, the infiltration volume for the
remaining area should be increased an equivalent amount
to offset the loss.
[3] Only if the minimum of 0.50 inch of infiltration
requirement cannot be physically accomplished, a waiver
from § 174-14, Infiltration volume requirements, is
required from the municipality.
B. Soils. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to
determine the suitability of infiltration facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified design professional and at minimum address
soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general
process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
(1) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the site to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is
under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of
subgrade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without
conducting these tests.
(2) Provide field tests such as double-ring infiltrometer or hydraulic
conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed infiltration surface)
to determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate.
Percolation tests are not recommended for design purposes.
(3) Design the infiltration structure for the required retention (Rev)
volume based on field determined capacity at the level of the
proposed infiltration surface.
(4) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant's
design professional, it must be demonstrated to the municipality
that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
§ 174-14 MARCUS HOOK CODE § 174-14
162:340
§ 174-15. Water Quality Requirements.
The applicant shall comply with the following water quality requirements of
this article:
C. Infiltration facilities should, to the greatest extent practicable, be
located to avoid introducing contaminants via groundwater, and be in
conformance with an approved source water protection assessment or
source water protection plan.
D. Roadway drainage systems should provide an opportunity to capture
accidental spills. Road deicing material storage facilities shall be
designed to avoid salt and chloride runoff from entering waterways and
infiltration facilities. The qualified design professional shall evaluate
the possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration facility and perform a hydrogeologic justification study if
necessary.
E. The antidegredation analysis found in Chapter 9375 shall be applied in
HQ or EV streams.
F. An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. The municipality may
require a detailed hydrogeologic investigation.
G. The applicant should provide safeguards against groundwater
contamination for land uses that may cause groundwater contamination
should there be a mishap or spill.
A. To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated
activities and conform to state water quality requirements, BMPs which
replicate predevelopment stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions
must be provided in the site design such that postconstruction
stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical, or
biological characteristics of the receiving waters. This may be achieved
by the following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions;
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to provide filtering
of chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff;
and
(3) Stream bank and streambed protection: management of volume
and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
B. Developed areas shall provide adequate storage and treatment facilities
necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. The infiltration
75.Editor's Note: See 25 Pa Code Chapter 93.
§ 174-14 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 174-15
162:341
volume computed under Section 305 may be a component of the water
quality volume if the applicant chooses to manage both components
in a single facility. If the calculated water quality volume (WQv) is
greater than the volume required to be infiltrated as described in
Section 305.A.2, then the difference between the two volumes shall
be treated for water quality by an acceptable stormwater management
practice(s). The required water quality volume (WQv) is the storage
capacity needed to capture and treat a portion of stormwater runoff
from the developed areas of the site. To achieve this requirement, the
following criterion is established:
(1) From Control Guideline (CG-1) in the Pennsylvania BMP Manual,
the water quality volume shall be the net two-year twenty-four-hour
volume. The net volume is the difference between the
postdevelopment runoff volume and the predevelopment runoff
volume. The postdevelopment total runoff volume for all storms
equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour duration
precipitation shall not be increased. For modeling purposes,
existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition or its equivalent, and 20% of
existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered
meadow in good condition.
(2) This volume requirement can be managed by the permanent
volume of a wet basin or the detained volume from other BMPs.
Where appropriate, wet basins shall be utilized for water quality
control and shall follow the guidelines of the Pennsylvania BMP
manual referenced in Appendix G.76
(3) Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert
of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The
design of the facility shall provide for protection from clogging and
unwanted sedimentation.
C. The temperature of receiving waters shall be protected through the use
of BMPs that moderate temperature.
D. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through, or a waterbody
(i.e., lake, pond, wetland) is present on the site, the applicant shall
create a riparian buffer extending a minimum of 50 feet, to either side
of the top-of-bank of the channel, lake, or wetland. The buffer area shall
be planted with native vegetation and maintained in a vegetated state
(refer to Appendix B, Pennsylvania Native Plant List, contained in the
Pennsylvania BMP Manual).
(1) The following provisions also apply to riparian buffers on lots in
existence at the time of adoption of this chapter:
76.Editor's Note: Appendix G is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 174-15 MARCUS HOOK CODE § 174-15
162:342
§ 174-16. Stream bank erosion requirements.
(a) If the applicable zoning setback is less than 50 feet, the buffer
width may be reduced to 25% of the setback or 25 feet,
whichever is greater.
(b) If a stream traverses a site in a manner that significantly
reduces the use of the site, the buffer may be either:
[1] Reduced to 25 feet on either side, with municipal approval;
or.
[2] Reduced to 10 feet with municipal waiver.
(2) Permitted uses within the buffer include the following, subject to
municipal approval and provided that they comply with all federal,
state, and local regulations:
(a) Recreational trails. See Appendix J, Riparian Buffer Trail
Guidelines.77
(b) Utility rights-of-way.
(c) Bridges.
(d) Other uses subject to municipal approval.
E. If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant,
easement, etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the
existing buffer shall be maintained.
A. In addition to controlling the water quality volume (in order to minimize
the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream stream bank erosion),
the primary requirement to control stream bank erosion is to design a
BMP to detain the proposed conditions two-year, twenty-four-hour
design storm to the existing conditions one-year flow using the SCS
Type II distribution. Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as
adding a small orifice at the bottom of the outlet structure) to release
the proposed conditions one-year storm for a minimum of 24 hours from
a point in time when the maximum volume of water from the one-year
storm is stored in a proposed BMP (i.e., the maximum water surface
elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water can begin at the
start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is at the
invert of the facility).
B. The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be
three inches in diameter where possible, and a trash rack shall be
installed to prevent clogging. On sites with small drainage areas
contributing to this BMP that do not provide enough runoff volume to
allow a twenty-four-hour attenuation with the three-inch orifice, the
calculations shall be submitted showing this condition. When the

162:343
§ 174-17. Stormwater peak rate control.
calculated orifice size is below three inches, gravel filters (or other
methods) are recommended to discharge low-flow rates subject to the
municipal engineer's satisfaction. When filters are utilized,
maintenance provisions shall be provided to ensure filters meet the
design function. All facilities shall make use of measures to extend the
flow path and increase the travel time of flows in the facility.
A. The watersheds in the municipality are shown on the Marcus Hook
Borough Watershed Map in Appendix A.78
(1) In addition to the watershed-specific requirements specified in
Table 174-17 below, the erosion and sedimentation control
(§ 174-12), the nonstructural project design (§ 174-13), the
infiltration (§ 174-14), the water quality (§ 174-15), and the stream
bank erosion (§ 174-16) requirements shall be implemented.
(2) Standards for managing runoff in the municipality for the two-, five-
, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year design storms are
shown in Table 174-17. Development sites in the municipality must
control proposed conditions runoff rates to existing conditions
runoff rates for the design storms in accordance with the table.

D. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development
site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable
peak runoff rates. On-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site.
E. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures
shall be subject to the peak rate control standards noted above.
Unimpacted areas for which the discharge point has not changed are
not subject to the peak rate control standards.
F. Hardship option for regulated activities less than one acre. There may
be certain instances, where the peak rate criteria are too restrictive for
a particular landowner or applicant. The existing drainage network in
some areas may be capable of safely transporting slight increases in
flows without causing a problem or increasing flows elsewhere. This
must be demonstrated as per § 174-17H below in order for the hardship
option to be considered. If an applicant or homeowner cannot meet the
stormwater standards due to lot conditions or if conformance would
become a hardship to an owner, the hardship option may be applied.
The applicant would have to plead his/her case to the governing body
with the final determination made by the municipality. Any landowners
pleading the "hardship option" will assume all liabilities that may arise
due to exercising this option. Cost or financial burden cannot be
considered as a hardship. The applicant may consider off-site
management controls or contributing to the Municipal Stormwater
Control and BMP Operation and Maintenance Fund (§ 174-37) as long
as the stormwater management controls are within the same
subwatershed.
G. Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use
the following criteria for determining adequacy of accepting increased
peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year storm event within
their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels
from erosion. Velocities shall be based upon criteria and
methodologies acceptable to the municipality.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased twenty-five-year storm event runoff without creating any
increased hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other hydraulic facilities
which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be
designed in accordance with PADEP Chapter 105 regulations (if
applicable) and, at a minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year
storm event runoff.

§ 174-18. Calculation methodology.
(4) Water quality requirements defined in § 174-16 must be met.
(5) Postconstruction peak rates shall not exceed the existing peak
rates for the respective subarea.
H. Alternate Criteria for Redevelopment Sites. For redevelopment sites,
one of the following minimum design parameters shall be
accomplished, whichever is most appropriate for the given site
conditions as determined by municipality;
(1) Meet the full requirements specified by Table 308.1 and § 174-17A
through H; or
(2) Subject to municipal approval the applicant may reduce the total
impervious surface on the site by at least 20%; based upon a
comparison of existing impervious surface to proposed impervious
surface. In this case, calculations must be provided that show the
peak rate has not increased.
A. Stormwater runoff from all development sites with a drainage area of
greater than five acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex
Method. Table 174-18 summarizes acceptable computation methods.
The method selected by the design professional shall be based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site. The use of the Rational Method to estimate peak discharges for
drainage areas greater than five acres shall be permitted only upon
approval of the municipality.

Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return period storms. Rainfall depths shall be according to
NOAA Atlas 14 values consistent with a partial duration series. When
stormwater calculations are performed for routing procedures or water
quality functions, the duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours.
C. The following criteria shall be used for peak rate runoff calculations:
(1) For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground
cover used in determining the existing conditions flow rates shall
be as follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of "woods in good
condition." Portions of a site having more than one viable tree
measuring a diameter at breast height (DBH) of six inches or
greater per 1,500 square feet shall be considered wooded
where such trees existed within three years of application.
(b) The undeveloped portion of the site including agriculture, bare
earth, and fallow ground shall be considered as "meadow in
good condition," unless the natural ground cover generates a
lower curve (CN) number or Rational "c" value (i.e., woods) as
listed in Tables F-1 or F-2 in Appendix F of this chapter.80
(2) For redevelopment sites, the ground cover used in determining the
existing conditions flow rates for the developed portion of the site
shall be based upon actual land cover conditions.
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration (duration) and
storm events with rainfall intensities obtained from NOAA Atlas 14
partial duration series estimates, or the latest version of the PennDOT
Drainage Manual (PDM Publication 584). Times-of-concentration shall
be calculated based on the methodology recommended in the

in Appendix F of the chapter.83
H. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
I. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using an acceptable
method. The design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a
calculation method that produces a full hydrograph. The municipality
may approve the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph
approximation technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is
consistent with the volume from a method that produces a full
hydrograph.
A. All wet basin designs shall incorporate biologic controls consistent with
the West Nile Guidance found in Appendix H, PADEP document
363-0300-001 "Design Criteria  Wetlands Replacement/Monitoring,"
or contact the Pennsylvania State Cooperative Wetland Center
(www.wetlands.psu.edu/) or the Penn State Cooperative Extension

the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
§ 180-3 TAXATION § 180-3
180:395
§ 180-4. Duty of employers to collect.
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough of Marcus Hook, in consultation with the
Collector and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of
refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for
exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the
general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest
on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or
75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for
the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be
subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough of Marcus Hook or
the Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide
refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his employ, whether
said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not
all such services are performed within the political subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section, For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.

180:396
§ 180-5. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 180-6. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 180-3 of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 180-4 TAXATION § 180-7
180:397
§ 180-7. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 180-8. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 180-9. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall
have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for
the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 180-10. Duty of Collector; administration and enforcement of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires that the
person work in more than one political subdivision during a payroll
period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in
the following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his
principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount

records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.

days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the

such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of

§ 180-28. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,

Removal, Impounding and Immobilization of Certain Vehicles
[Amended 4-2-2007 by Ord. No. O-07-3, approved 4-2-2007]
§ 191-51. Statutory authority; scope.
This article is enacted under authority of § 6109(a)(22) of the Pennsylvania
Vehicle Code and gives authority to the Borough to remove and impound
vehicles that are parked on the highways, streets or public property in the
Borough in violation of local ordinances.
§ 191-52. Authority to remove and impound vehicles.
The Borough shall have the authority to remove and impound any vehicle
by means of towing to the nearest approved storage garage any vehicle
that is parked on the highways, streets or public property in the Borough
in violation of local ordinances. No vehicle shall be removed under the
authority of this section if, at the time of the intended removal, the owner
or the person for the time being in charge of the vehicle is present and
expresses a willingness and intention to remove the vehicle immediately.
§ 191-53. Authority to immobilize and impound vehicles.
The Borough shall have the authority to immobilize any vehicle for up to 72
hours by means of applying a boot and then towing to the nearest approved
storage garage, if not reclaimed, any vehicle that is parked on the highways,
streets or public property in the Borough and has three or more delinquent
parking tickets for which appropriate notice has been sent to the registered
owner. In any case involving immobilization of a vehicle pursuant to this
section, a notice shall be placed on such a vehicle in a conspicuous manner
sufficient to warn any individual that such vehicle has been immobilized and
that any attempt to move such vehicle may result in damage thereto and
that proof of payment of the delinquent parking tickets must be presented
to the Borough in order for the boot to be removed.
§ 191-54. Notification of removal and impounding.
Within 12 hours from the time of removal of any vehicle under authority
granted by this article, notice of the fact that the vehicle was removed
and impounded shall be sent by the Borough to the owner of record of the
vehicle. The notice shall designate the place from which the vehicle was
removed, the reason for its removal, the garage in which it was impounded,
the applicable fees and the possibility that the vehicle will be sold at
public auction if not reclaimed within 15 days of issuance of the notice.
When the Borough intends to retain possession of the vehicle pending
an investigation, the notice shall so state, and the Borough shall issue a
subsequent notice informing the owner of the appropriate time that the
vehicle may be reclaimed.
§ 191-51 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 191-55
188:445
§ 191-55. Effect of payment of towing and storage charges.
The payment of any towing and storage charges authorized by this article
shall, unless payment is made under protest, be final and conclusive and
shall constitute a waiver of any right to recover the money so paid. If
payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the
offender shall be entitled to a hearing before a District Justice. Payment
of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or driver of any
vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of the provision
of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or impounded.
§ 191-56. Failure to reclaim vehicle.
When a vehicle has not been reclaimed within 15 days of issuance of notice
that it is available to be reclaimed, the Borough or its designated agent shall
thereafter send notice to the owner of record and all registered lienholders
of the vehicle informing such owner and lienholders that the vehicle may
be reclaimed upon proof of right to possession and payment of outstanding
fees, charges and fines and that the vehicle may be sold at public auction if
not reclaimed within 15 days.
§ 191-57. Designation of garages; bonding; towing and storage.
Removal and impounding of vehicles under this article shall be done only
by approved storage garages that shall be designated from time to time
by the Borough Council. Every such garage shall submit evidence to the
Borough Council that it is bonded or has acquired liability insurance in
an amount satisfactory to the Borough Council as sufficient to indemnify
owners of impounded vehicles against loss or damage to those vehicles
while in the custody of the garage keeper for the purpose of towing or
storage. The approved garage shall submit to the Borough Council its
schedule of charges for towing and storage of vehicles under this article
and, when the schedule is approved by the Borough Council, those charges
shall be adhered to by the approved storage garage. No different schedule
of charges shall be adopted without approval by the Borough Council, and
no different charges shall be demanded of or collected from any person
whose vehicle is removed or impounded under this article by any approved
storage garage. The Borough Council shall delete from its list of approved
storage garages any garage that makes any unapproved charge in
connection with any vehicle removed or impounded under this article.
§ 191-57.1. Record of vehicles removed, impounded and
immobilized.
The Borough shall cause a record to be kept of all vehicles removed,
impounded or immobilized under this article and shall be able at all
reasonable times to furnish the owners or the agents of the owners of those
vehicles with information as to the place of storage of the vehicle.

(1) Designation of residential parking area. All streets in the Borough
of Marcus Hook are hereby designated as residential permit
parking areas seven days a week, 24 hours a day, with the
exception of Market Street, between 4th Street and Delaware
Avenue, 10th Street, entire length, and metered parking spaces.
(a) Market Street, between 4th Street and Delaware Avenue, and
10th Street, entire length, are designated residential permit
parking areas between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
(b) Signs shall be erected along the streets indicating that parking
shall be by permit only.
(2) Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
(a) Vehicles of the Borough of Marcus Hook or employees engaged
in the work of the Borough; fire apparatus; ambulances; or
vehicles engaged in the work of a public utility.
(b) Vehicles actually engaged in the course of construction or
repair of streets or while actually engaged in making deliveries
or rendering services on or upon any property adjacent to the
street where said vehicle is parked.
(c) Any school bus actually engaged in picking up or discharging
students but only for a period of time necessary to safely pick
up and discharge students.
(d) Employees of businesses adjoining residential permit parking
areas who have been issued special parking permits.
(3) Application for permit. Effective January 1, 2020, every three years,
application for a residential parking permit shall be made to the

owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on a property
immediately adjacent to a street or other location within the
§ 191-82 MARCUS HOOK CODE § 191-83
188:464

following information: the name of the owner of the motor vehicle;
the address of the resident; the make, model and registration
number of the motor vehicle; the driver number as taken from
the applicant's current driver's license; and vehicle insurance
information. The applicant shall be required, at the time of making

a Marcus Hook address. One residential parking permit will be
issued for each vehicle registered to a Marcus Hook address but
not to exceed the number of licensed drivers in the household.

parking permit, the Chief of Police shall issue to the applicant a
residential parking permit.
(5) Temporary and exemption parking permits. Temporary parking
permits may be issued by the Chief of Police to bona fide visitors of
residents and to residents with rented vehicles. Residents are to
advise the Marcus Hook Police Department when a visitor or
visitors are expected, providing the make, model, and license
number of the visitor's vehicle. A visitor parking permit shall not
authorize its holder to park a motor vehicle in any one place on a
street designated a residential parking area for a period in excess
of 12 consecutive hours and in excess of five occasions per month.

permit exempt its holder from the observance of any traffic or
parking regulation other than residential permit parking
regulations or restriction.
(c) No permit issued shall be transferable. No person other than
the permit holder who was issued the permit shall use a
§ 191-83 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 191-83
188:465
residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle operated.
Any such use or display by a person other than the permit
holder shall constitute a violation of this section by the permit
holder and by the person who so used or displayed the parking
permit.
(d) It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person
falsely to represent himself as eligible for residential parking
permit or to furnish false information in an application to the
Chief of Police in order to obtain a residential parking permit.
(7) Revocation of permit. The Chief of Police shall have the authority to
revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to
be in violation of any provision of this section. Upon written
notification to the permit holder of the revocation, the permit
holder shall surrender the permit to the Chief of Police. Failure to
do so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of this
section, provided that any person receiving such a notice may,
within 10 days after the date of the notice, appeal to the Council for
a hearing on the revocation, and the decision of the Council shall be
final.107

ARTICLE XIX
Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 196-145. Purpose.
Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments thereto,
there exist certain uses, structures, and lots which were lawful before
this chapter was enacted or amended but which do not conform to the
provisions of this chapter or amendment thereto. These uses, structures,
or lots are referred to as "nonconformities." The regulations governing
existing nonconforming uses, structures, and lots are set forth in this article
and are intended to provide a gradual remedy for the undesirable conditions
resulting from such nonconformities. While such nonconformities are
generally permitted to continue, these regulations are intended to restrict
further investment in such nonconformities and to bring about their gradual
reduction.
§ 196-146. Continuation.
All structures, lots, uses of structures, and uses of land that do not conform
to the regulations of the district in which they are located after the effective
date of this chapter or amendment thereto shall be regarded as
nonconforming and may be continued so long as they remain otherwise
lawful, including subsequent sales of property. Such uses must comply with
all safety related and other applicable regulations.
§ 196-147. Enlargement.
A nonconforming use or structure may be extended, enlarged, or altered
when so authorized as a conditional use, provided that the following
conditions are met and a permit is obtained as per Article XXI:
A. It is clear that such enlargement or extension is not materially
detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding area.
B. The proposed enlargement or extension only occurs on the tract where
the nonconformity is currently located.
C. The area devoted to the nonconforming use shall not be increased by
more than 25%. The nonconforming structure shall not be increased by
more than 25% of its cubic content.
D. Any extension or enlargement of a building shall conform to the area,
height, and setback regulations of the district in which it is located. In
determining cubic content, that portion of a stack or projection above
the highest point of the principal building shall be excluded from the
calculation.
E. Not more than one extension or enlargement to a nonconforming use or
structure shall be granted.
§ 196-145 VEHICLES, MOTOR-DRIVEN § 196-148
193:573

Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be permitted
to revert to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may be changed to
another equally restrictive or more restrictive nonconforming use when so
determined by the Borough Council, subject to the following conditions:
§ 196-149. Enclosure.
Where a nonconforming use is conducted entirely on unenclosed premises,
no structure to house or enclose such use, whether or not such structure
would otherwise conform to zoning regulations, shall be permitted to be
erected on the premises.
§ 196-150. Abandonment.
If a nonconforming use of a building or land is abandoned for 12 consecutive
months or more, whereby the owner discontinues the use, the subsequent
use of such a building or land shall conform to the regulations of the district
in which it is located, unless another nonconforming use is approved by
Borough Council. Such approved use shall be initiated within 120 days after
the approval of Council.
§ 196-151. Reconstruction.
A nonconforming structure, a conforming structure devoted to a
nonconforming use, or a structure that has been legally condemned or
destroyed by fire or other cause to less than 75% of the current value of the
structure may be reconstructed and used for the same nonconforming use,
provided that:
A. The applicant shall show that the nonconforming use cannot be
reasonably changed to a conforming use.
B. The applicant shall show that the proposed change will be no more
objectionable in external effects than the existing nonconforming use or
will be more appropriate than the existing nonconforming use with
regard to:
(1) Traffic generation and congestion.
(2) Parking.
(3) Noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, heat, odor, glare, or
vibration.

A lot held in single and separate ownership on the effective date of this
chapter which does not contain the required minimum area or width may
be used for the construction, alteration, or reconstruction of a building or
may be otherwise used if the construction, alteration, reconstruction, or
other use is in compliance with the use, yard, and setback provisions of this
chapter.
§ 196-155. Reduction of lot area.
No lot area shall be so reduced that the area of the lot or the dimensions of
the open space shall be smaller than herein prescribed.
§ 196-156. Nonconforming signs.
Regulations for nonconforming signs are in Article XVI relating to signs.
A. The reconstructed structure shall not exceed the height, area, and
volume of the building destroyed or condemned.
B. Reconstruction of the structure shall commence within 12 months from
the date the structure was destroyed or condemned, unless Borough
Council shall authorize a conditional use for an extension of this time
limit. However, an extension may be granted if delays related to
permitting delay construction.
A. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of six consecutive
months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of nonbearing
walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic content
existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
B. If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe due to lack of
repairs and maintenance and is declared by the Zoning Officer to be
unsafe by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
restored or repaired except to conform to the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
C. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared
to be unsafe by the Zoning Officer.
§ 196-151 VEHICLES, MOTOR-DRIVEN § 196-157
193:575
§ 196-157. Registration of nonconforming uses.
Every five years, the Zoning Officer may prepare, or cause to be prepared,
a complete list of all nonconforming uses, structures, lots, and signs in the
Borough.
§ 196-158. Ownership.
Whenever a lot is sold to a new owner, a previously lawful nonconforming
use may be continued by the new owner.
§ 196-159. Violations.
A nonconforming structure altered or a nonconforming use created in
violation of any previous provisions in this article shall be regarded as
continuing in such violation and shall not enjoy the privilege of legal
continuance conferred by § 196-146 upon other nonconforming structures
and uses.

nonconforming use or structure.
B. Application for zoning permits. Application for zoning permits shall be
made to the Zoning Officer or, in the case of occupancy permits, to the
Code Enforcement Officer on such forms as may be furnished by the
Borough. Each application shall contain all information necessary to
ascertain whether the proposed erection, alteration, use, or change in
use complies with the provisions of this chapter.

E. Expiration of permits. Permits for the erection, razing, change,
alteration, or removal of a building shall be valid or effective for a
period of not more than six months from the date of issuance thereof
and shall thereafter be void, unless the work authorized by such permit
shall have been substantially commenced within that period and
continues with due diligence from that time forward. In no event shall a
zoning permit be construed to authorize the development activities for
more than a one-year period of time, after which time a new permit
must be sought. If, however, the applicant has been delayed in
proceeding with the work for which the permit was granted for reasons
beyond his or her control and demonstrably not due to his or her own
negligence, at the discretion of the Zoning Officer the permit may be
renewed without additional costs to the applicant.
F. Occupancy permits.
(1) Applicability. An occupancy permit shall be deemed to authorize
and is required for both initial and continued occupancy and use of
the building or land to which it applies. Such a permit shall certify
that the premises has been inspected and complies with all
§ 196-166 VEHICLES, MOTOR-DRIVEN § 196-166
193:583
previously approved plans and all conditions or safeguards

premises and either certify its compliance with the previously
approved plans and all conditions and safeguards stated upon
issuance of an occupancy permit or deny such certification. In
the case of a change in occupancy or use of an existing building
or vacant land (when no zoning permit is required), the CEO
shall verify compliance with the applicable zoning regulations.
(b) If the certification of the occupancy permit form is denied, the
CEO shall state in writing the reasons for such denial.

ARTICLE XXII
Zoning Hearing Board
§ 196-168. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to list and describe the powers, procedures,
composition, and standards for the Zoning Hearing Board, as required by
the Planning Code.
§ 196-169. Administration and procedure.
A. Creation of the Zoning Hearing Board. A Zoning Hearing Board for the
Borough of Marcus Hook shall be appointed by Borough Council and
shall be authorized to administer all procedures charged to such boards
in accordance with the provisions of Article IX of the Pennsylvania MPC,
as amended.124 Hereinafter, as used in this article, the term "Board"
shall refer to the Zoning Hearing Board, and the term "Planning Code"
shall refer to the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247,
as amended.125
B. Membership of the Board. The Board shall consist of five residents of
the Borough. Their terms of office shall be five years and shall be so
fixed that the term of office of one member shall expire each year. The
Board shall promptly notify the Borough of any vacancies. Appointment
to fill vacancies shall be only for the unexpired portion of the term.
Members of the Board shall hold no other office in the Borough and
shall not be employees of the Borough.
C. Removal of members. Any member may be removed for malfeasance,
misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office or for other just cause by a
majority rule of Borough Council taken after the member has received
15 days' advance notice of the intent to take such a vote. A hearing shall
be held in connection with the vote if the member requests it in writing.
D. Organization of the Board.
(1) The Board shall elect from its own membership its officers, who
shall serve annual terms as such and may succeed themselves. For
the conduct of any hearing and the taking of any action, a quorum
shall be not less than the majority of all members of the Board, but
where a majority of members are disqualified to act in a particular
matter, the remaining members may act for the Board. As provided
for in the Planning Code, the Board may appoint a hearing officer
from its own membership to conduct any hearing on its behalf, and
the parties may waive further action by the Board, as provided in
Section 908 of the Planning Code.126
124. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10901 et seq.

(2) The Board shall adopt rules and forms for its procedure in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Meetings of the
Board shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at such other
times as the Board may determine. Such Chairman or, in his
absence, the Acting Chairman, may administer oaths and compel
the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be
open to the public.
(3) The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote
of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote,
indicate such fact, and shall keep records of its examination and
other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the
Office of the Borough Manager and shall be a public record.
(4) The Board shall submit a report of its activities to Borough Council
as requested.
E. Expenditures for services. Within the limits of funds appropriated by
Borough Council, the Board may employ or contract for secretaries,
clerks, legal counsel, consultants, and other technical and clerical
services. Members of the Board may receive compensation for the
performance of their duties as may be fixed by Borough Council, but in
no case shall it exceed the rate of compensation authorized to be paid to
members of Borough Council.
A. Appeals from the Zoning Officer. The Board shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged that the Zoning Officer has failed to follow
prescribed procedures or has misinterpreted or misapplied any
provision of this chapter or the Zoning Map or any valid rule or
regulation governing the action of the Zoning Officer.
B. Applications. Applications for variances or special exceptions shall
include as a minimum the following information:
(1) A sketch plan, at scale, showing the layout of the property, the
proposed improvements and alterations thereto, and the
relationship of the tract to adjacent properties.

reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to

193:589
§ 196-174. Standards for Zoning Hearing Board action.
In any instance where the Zoning Hearing Board is required to consider a
variance or special exception, the Board shall, among other things, consider
the following standards:
C. Conclusions of the Board, enumerating the reasons why such
conclusions are deemed appropriate in light of the facts found.
D. Ruling of the Board, indicating in writing any stipulations or conditions
attached to the ruling.
A. Planning Code criteria for variances.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship on the
applicant.
(2) A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by
the Board unless and until a written application for a variance is
submitted by the applicant who shall have the burden of
establishing the presence of all of the following conditions where
relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not to the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of the variance is, therefore, necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
§ 196-173 MARCUS HOOK CODE § 196-174
193:590
(3) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of the Planning Code and this chapter.
B. Standards for review of special exceptions.
(1) In any instance where the Board is required to consider a request
for a special exception, the Board shall consider the following
factors where appropriate:
(a) That the proposed use is appropriate for the site in question in
terms of size, topography, natural features, drainage, sewage
disposal, water supply, accessibility, and availability of public
services and that adequate provisions will be made to protect
sensitive environmental features such as streams, lakes,
wetlands, slopes, and mature trees.
(b) That the proposed use is compatible with the character of the
surrounding neighborhood and will not interfere with or
detract from legitimate uses and adjacent properties, and that
adequate measures will be provided through building design,
site layout, landscaping, planting, and operational controls to
minimize any adverse impacts caused by noise, lights, glare,
odors, smoke, fumes, traffic, parking, loading, and signage.
(c) That the proposed special exception will serve the best interest
of the Borough, convenience of the community, and the public
health, safety, and welfare.
(d) That the proposed use is consistent with the most recently
adopted Marcus Hook Comprehensive Plan.
(e) That the proposed use promotes orderly development, proper
population density, and the provision of adequate community
facilities and services, including police and fire protection.
(f) That the proposed use is suitable in terms of its effect on
highway safety and traffic circulation and that access, on-site
circulation, and parking are adequate in view of anticipated
traffic.
(g) That the proposed use will provide for adequate off-street
parking, as required in Article XV.
(2) In cases where uses permitted by special exception are not
accompanied by specific standards for such uses, the regulations in
§ 196-130 shall apply.
(3) Financial hardship shall not be construed as a basis for granting
special exceptions.
(4) In granting any special exception, the Board may attach reasonable
conditions and safeguards in addition to those expressed in this
§ 196-174 VEHICLES, MOTOR-DRIVEN § 196-174
193:591
§ 196-175. Standards of proof.
chapter as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the
Planning Code and this chapter, which conditions and safeguards
may relate to, but not be limited to, screening, lighting, noise,
safety, aesthetics, and the minimization of noxious, offensive, or
hazardous elements. Such special exceptions shall be clearly
authorized by a provision in this chapter and shall, where
applicable, comply with the more specific standards relating to
such special exceptions contained in appropriate sections of Article
XVIII.
A. For variances. An applicant for a variance shall have the burden of
establishing both:
(1) That a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will
result in unnecessary hardship, as that term is defined by law,
including court decisions; and
(2) That the allowance of the variance will not be contrary to the public
interest.
B. For special exceptions. An applicant for a special exception shall have
the burden of establishing both:
(1) That his application falls within the provisions of this chapter which
affords to the applicant the right to seek a special exception; and
(2) That the allowance of a special exception will not be contrary to the
public interest.
C. Evaluation of the impact of an application on the public interest. In
determining whether the allowance of a variance or special exception is
contrary to the public interest, the Board shall consider whether the
application, if granted, will:
(1) Adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare due to
changes in traffic conditions, drainage, air quality, noise levels,
neighborhood property values, natural features, and neighborhood
aesthetic characteristics.
(2) Be in accordance with the most recently adopted Marcus Hook
Comprehensive Plan.
(3) Provide required parking in accordance with Article XV of this
chapter.
(4) Adversely affect the logical, efficient, and economical extension or
provision of public services and facilities such as public water,
sewers, refuse collection, police, fire protection, and public
schools.
(5) Otherwise adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare.

shall expire if the applicant fails to obtain a building permit within six
months from the date of authorization thereof.
