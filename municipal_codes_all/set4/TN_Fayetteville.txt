Confidential information. All information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaire permit application, permits and monitoring 


programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public or any othergovernmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requestsand is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of FPU that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of productionentitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of areport which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be madeavailable for inspection by the public, but shall be made available togovernmental agencies for use related to this chapter, FPU's NPDES permit, orthe user's NPDES permit. Provided, however, that such portions of a reportshall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review orenforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewaterconstituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
Information accepted by FPU as confidential shall not be transmitted toany governmental agency or to the general public by FPU until and unless priorand adequate notification is given to the user. (1995 Code, § 18-215) 
18-216. Industrial pretreatment requirements. (1) Monitoring facilities. The installation of a monitoring facility may be required for anyindustrial user. A monitoring facility may be a manhole or other suitable facilityapproved by FPU. When in the judgment of FPU there is a significant differencein wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operationsof a single user, FPU may require that separate monitoring facilities be installedfor each separate source of discharge. Monitoring facilities shall be constructedand maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enableinspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced by a user.If sampling or metering equipment is required, it shall be provided and installedat the user's expense. All sampling and metering equipment shall be approvedby FPU before installation. The monitoring facility will normally be required tobe located on the user's premises outside of the building. There shall be ampleroom in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate samplingand preparation of samples for analysis. Whether constructed on public orprivate property, the monitoring facility shall be constructed in accordance withFPU's requirements and all applicable FPU construction standards andspecifications. When, in the judgment of FPU, an existing user requires amonitoring facility, the user will be so notified in writing. Construction must becompleted within one hundred eighty (180) days following written notificationunless an extension is granted by FPU.
(2) 
Housekeeping. The facility and sampling and measuringequipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operatingcondition, and kept clean, at the expense of the user. The failure of a user tokeep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for theuser to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 

(3) 
Inspection and sampling. FPU will inspect the facilities of any userto ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and allrequirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises wherewastewater is created or discharged shall allow FPU ready access at allreasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection,sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties.FPU, the approval authority, or the EPA shall have the right to set up on theuser's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a user has securitymeasures to enforce which would require proper identification and clearancebefore entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangementswith their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,FPU, the approval authority, or the EPA will be permitted to enter, withoutdelay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. FPU willinspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at leastonce every twelve (12) months.

(4) 
Safety. While performing the necessary work on private properties,FPU shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by thecompany and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to FPUemployees. FPU shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to itsproperty by FPU employees and against liability claims and demands forpersonal injury or property damages asserted against the company and growingout of the monitoring and sampling operation, except as such may be caused bynegligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.

(5) 
Accidental and slug discharge requirements. (a) Protection fromaccidental and slug discharge. All industrial users shall provide suchfacilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably necessary toprevent or minimize the potential for accidental or slug discharge in thePOTW of waste regulated by this chapter from liquid or raw materialstorage areas, from truck and rail car loading and unloading areas, fromin-plant transfer or processing and materials handling areas, and fromdikes or holding ponds of any waste regulated by this chapter. Thewastewater discharge permit of any user who has a history of significantleaks, spills, or other accidental discharge of waste regulated by thischapter shall be subject on a case-by-case basis to a special permitcondition or requirement for the construction of facilities or establishmentof procedures which will prevent or minimize the potential for suchaccidental discharge. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge ofprohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user'sexpense. Detailed plans showing the facilities and operating proceduresshall be submitted to FPU before the facility is constructed. The reviewand approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no wayrelieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility to providethe protection necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. 

(b) 
Notification of accidental discharge or slug discharge. Anyperson causing or suffering any slug or accidental discharge or adischarge, whether accidental or not, which presents or may present animminent or substantial endangerment to human health and welfare orthe environment, or which is likely to cause interference with the POTW,shall immediately notify FPU by telephone to enable countermeasures tobe taken to minimize damage to the POTW, the health and welfare of thepublic, and the environment. The notification shall include the locationof the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume (if known), andcorrective action taken by user.




This notification shall be followed, within five (5) days of the dateof occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the cause of thedischarge and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrences.
Such notification will not relieve the user of liability for anyexpense, loss or damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage toperson or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of anyfines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by thischapter or state or federal law.
(c) 
Slug discharge control program. FPU shall evaluate whethereach significant industrial user needs a plan or procedure to controlaccidental or slug discharges. For new sources, this evaluation must beperformed within twelve (12) months of commencing discharge. If FPUdecides that an accident or slug discharge control plan is needed, the planshall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:

(i) Description of discharge practices, includingnon-routine batch discharges;
(ii) Description of stored chemicals;
(iii) Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW ofslug discharges, including any discharge that would violate aprohibition under §§ 18-212 or 18-213, with procedures forfollow-up written notification within five (5) days;
(iv) 
Any necessary procedures to prevent accidental spills,inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling andtransfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control ofplant site run-off, and worker training;

(v) 
Any necessary measures for building containmentstructures or equipment;

(vi) 
Any additional measures necessary for containingtoxic organic pollutants (including solvents);


(vii) Any necessary procedures and equipment for emergency response; and
(viii) Any necessary follow-up practices to limit the damagesuffered by the POTW or the environment.

(6) 
Bypass. (a) For the purposes of this section: 

(i) 
Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.

(ii) 
Severe property damage means substantial physicaldamage to property, damage to the treatment facilities whichcauses them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanentloss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occurin the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not meaneconomic loss caused by delays in production.



(b) 
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not causepretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it alsois for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypassesare not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.

(c) 
Bypass notifications:

(i) 
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,it shall submit prior notice to FPU, at least ten (10) days before thedate of the bypass, if possible.

(ii) 
A user shall submit oral notice to FPU of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatmentstandards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomesaware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be providedwithin five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of thebypass. The written submission shall contain a description of thebypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exactdates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, theanticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken orplanned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of thebypass. FPU may waive the written report on a case by case basisif the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.

(d) 
Bypass. (i) Bypass is prohibited, and FPU may take anenforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

(A) 
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,personal injury, or severe property damage;

(B) 
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities,retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance duringnormal periods of equipment downtime. This condition isnot satisfied if adequate back up equipment should havebeen installed in the exercise of reasonable engineeringjudgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normalperiods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance;and 

(C) 
The user submitted notices as required undersubsection (c) of this section. 



(ii) 
FPU may approve an anticipated bypass, afterconsidering its adverse effects, if FPU determines that it will meetthe three (3) conditions listed in subsection (d)(i) of this section.(1995 Code, § 18-216) 




18-217. National categorical pretreatment standards. Upon thepromulgation of the national categorical pretreatment standards for a particularindustrial subcategory, the national categorical standard, if more stringent thanlimitations imposed under the chapter for sources in that subcategory, shallimmediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. FPU shallnotify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR,section 403.12. Compliance with national categorical pretreatment standards forexisting sources subject to such standards, or for existing sources whichhereafter become subject to such standards, shall be achieved within three (3)years following promulgation of the standards unless a shorter compliance timeis specified. Compliance for new sources shall be required upon promulgation.New sources shall have in operating condition and shall start up all pollutioncontrol equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards beforebeginning to discharge within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety
(90)
 day). New sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. (1995Code, § 18-217) 

18-218. Reporting requirements.

FPU may modify an existing wastewater discharge permitin response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.

(c) 
In the case of any non-routine discharge the user shallimmediately telephone and notify the FPU of the incident stating thelocation of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, ifknown, and corrective actions taken by the user. Within five (5) daysfollowing such discharge, the user shall submit a detailed written reportdescribing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures taken or to betaken to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall notrelieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which 

might be incurred as a result of the damage to POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notificationrelieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may beimposed pursuant to this chapter.

(d) 
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletinboard or other prominent place advising employees who to call in theevent of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure that allemployees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of theemergency notification procedure.

Significant industrial users are required to notify FPUimmediately of any changes at the facility affecting the potential for aslug discharge. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewaterdischarge permit shall provide appropriate reports that may be requiredby FPU to determine user status.

(f) 
All users not required to obtain an individual wastewaterdischarge permit shall provide appropriate reports that may be requiredby FPU to determine user status.



(6) 
Reporting of violation. If sampling performed by an industrial userindicates a violation, the user shall notify FPU within twenty-four (24) hours ofbecoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling andanalysis within fourteen (14) days of the notification, and submit the results ofthe repeat analysis to FPU. Where FPU has performed the sampling andanalysis in lieu of the industrial user, FPU must perform the repeat samplingand analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user toperform the repeat analysis.

(7) 
Hazardous waste discharges. Any waste which if otherwisedisposed of would be a hazardous waste as defined in 40 CFR 261 shall not bedischarged into FPU's sewer system.

(8)

(b) 
Monitoring shall be performed at the approved monitoringstation on the effluent sewer. Location and design of the monitoringstation shall be subject to the review and approval of FPU. Any changein monitoring location will be subject to the approval of FPU.

(c) 
Sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordancewith the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendmentsthereto. If 40 CFR, part 136 does not contain sampling or analyticaltechniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines 

that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriatefor the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performedby using validated analytical methods or any other applicable samplingand analytical procedures approved by the EPA and FPU.

(d) 
Except as indicated in subsections (e) and (f) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized byFPU. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling isauthorized, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Usingprotocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collectedduring a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior to analysisas follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may becomposited in a laboratory or in the field; for volatile organic and oil andgrease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Compositesamples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing proceduresas documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized byFPU, as appropriate. Additional grab samples may be required to showcompliance with instantaneous limits.

(e) 
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, totalphenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained usinggrab collection techniques. Alternately, pH compliance may be accessedthrough the use of a strip-chart or a circular chart over the monitoringperiod from a continuous pH recorder, at the discretion of FPU.

(f) 
For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring andninety (90) day compliance reports required in (1) and (3) of this section,a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, totalphenols, oil and grease, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds forfacilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. For facilities forwhich historical sampling data are available, FPU may authorize a lowerminimum. For reports required by section (4)(a) and 40 CFR 403.12(2)and (h), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grabsamples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicablepretreatment standards.

14-510 OVERLAY ZONE FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (Deleted and Replaced by Ordinance No. 2004-16, August 10, 2004)
The purpose of this section is to provide a permissive voluntary alternative procedure to be utilized in the placement of buildings and in the location of open spaces associated therewith. These provisions are intended to provide variations in lot size and open space requirements within the residential districts. The density standards established
5-45
for individual districts are to be maintained on an overall basis and thereby provide desirable and proper open air space, tree cover, recreation areas or scenic vistas; all with the intent of preserving the natural beauty of the area, while at the same time maintaining the necessary maximum population density limitations of the district in which this procedure may be permitted.
A. General Provisions
The provisions contained within this section are intended to provide a flexible procedure for locating dwellings upon sites within the R-1, R-2, and R-3 Districts. As such, the provisions do not constitute a use, but an alternative procedure for the spacing of buildings and the use of open areas surrounding those buildings. It is necessary, however, that the purposes and intent of this ordinance be assured and that proper light, air, and privacy be made available for each dwelling unit. The minimum land area required for such a development shall be three (3) acres.
A site development plan as provided for in this section is required not only as an accurate statement of the development, but as an enforceable legal instrument whereby the Planning Commission may be assured that the general purposes, standards, etc., contained in this section are being met.
B. Site Development Plan Required
1. Contents
A site development plan containing the information required by Section 14-803, shall be prepared and submitted to the Planning Commission for its review and approval along with a sketch plat as required by the Subdivision Regulations.
2. Coordinated Review
Upon receipt of a site development plan and sketch plat containing information as required above, the Planning Commission may:
a. Concurrently review the site development plan and sketch plat; and any covenants as associated with such development.
b. Jointly approve, approve with modification, or disapprove these documents; and
c. In the instance of approval, or approval with modification, transfer the site development plan to the Building Inspector for enforcement.
3. Enforcement
Upon approval of a site development plan, the Building Inspector shall become responsible for enforcement of the plan. Only minimal adjustments involving the placement of any structure will be permitted once a site development plan has been approved. Any other change shall require submission of a proposed amendment to the approved plan.
5-46
C. Development Standards
The following standards and requirements shall apply to all alternative density developments.
1. General Standards for Development
In the interest of promoting the most appropriate economical use of the land while assuring that the character of the residential district is maintained, the Planning Commission in its review of a proposed development shall consider the following:
a. The protection of the character, property values, privacy and other characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood;
b. The provision for surface drainage control, sewage disposal, water supply, recreation and traffic control; and
c. The preservation and protection of existing trees, ground cover, topsoil, streams, rock outcroppings and scenic or historic sites from dangers and damage caused by excessive and poorly planned grading for streets and building sites.
2. Availability of Public Utilities
Generally all public utilities, specifically including water and a central sewage collection and treatment system, as defined by this ordinance, shall be available. Where public sewer is not available, no lot or housing site may be created which is less than thirty-three thousand (33,000) square feet in area and all septic fields for each dwelling unit shall be located within the area of fee simple ownership of said dwelling unit.
3. Permitted Density
The density permitted is intended to be within the range of that permitted within more typical developments offering no common open space. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted shall be computed as follows:

A. Purpose and Intent of District
Theses regulations are designed to promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification in the location of structures; to promote efficient use of land that will facilitate a more economic arrangement of buildings; circulation systems, land use and utilities; to preserve as much as possible existing landscape features and utilize them in a harmonious fashion; to encourage the total planning of tracts of land; and to provide a mechanism for ownership of land, utilities, streets and facilities in common as well as the maintenance of disposition thereof.
The intent of this ordinance is two-fold:
1. Meet Fayettevilles goals through well planned, integrated, high quality mixed use in new and redevelopment projects:
a. Enhance health and safety goals by utilizing requirements for pedestrian orientation and high quality, durable, building materials.
b. Increase Fayettevilles prosperity goals and citizen welfare by appreciated property values which will support necessary public services.
c. Actualize our cultural heritage through citizen pride in creative, new places to walk to, shop at and work that retain a flavor of Fayettevilles rich history.
d. Enhance diversity goals with new types of residential uses in close-knit community design.
e. Improve our natural environment goal by mixed use redevelopment with incentives for more intensely landscaped buffers and open spaces designed to complement Fayettevilles parks and greenspace.
2. Improve the potential for financially attractive and high quality mixed use projects in Fayetteville.
a. Enhance incentives for investment by the ability to mix residential with commercial and office uses within the same development.
b Facilitate flexibility in design of rigid setback and parking requirements.
c. Encourage redevelopment by the ability to increase square footage and dwelling units per acre.
6-110
d. Achieve attractive and commercially successful core areas through cooperative development projects with one or more land owners.
e. Increase the level of community amenities within mixed use developments by permitting higher density use.

2. Zoning Amendment
After approval of the preliminary master plan, the Planning Commission shall recommend an amendment to the Mayor and the Board of Aldermen reclassifying the proposed MPUD to the appropriate planned unit development district. If the Board approved the amendment, the landowner may submit a final master plan to the Planning Commission, and the Planning Commission is authorized to proceed with all future details of the project.
3. Application for Final Approval
Within one (1) year of the preliminary approval and rezoning of a planned unit development, the landowner may make application to the Planning Commission for final approval, provided that the proposed master development plan and other elements associated with the planned unit development are in substantial compliance with the substance of the preliminary approval of the Planning Commission. The application shall include all aspects of the preliminary application, the proposed final master development plan, other required drawings, specifications, covenants, easements, and conditions and forms of bond as were set forth by the Planning Commission ordinance of preliminary approval. Copies of all legal documents required for dedication or reservation of group or common open space and/or for the creation of a nonprofit association shall also be submitted. When appropriate, this application shall contain the stated development schedule.
6-126
4. Final Master Development Plan of a Planned Unit Development
The final master plan of a planned unit development for the entire development, or as submitted in stages if authorized, shall be substantially consistent with the approved preliminary master development plan receiving preliminary approval plus the following:
The location of water, sewerage, and drainage facilities; detailed building and landscaping plans and elevations; character and location of signs; plans for street improvements; and grading and earth moving plans showing existing and proposed topography. The final master development plan shall be sufficiently detailed to indicate fully the ultimate operation and appearance of the development. The recorded Master Plan must be an attachment to a boundary survey and must be filed with the Lincoln County Registrar.
5. Amendments to the PUD
The terms, conditions, and the final master plan of a PUD may be changed from time to time by official action of the Planning Commission. Any such amendments must remain in compliance with the appropriate zoning regulations and comply with the following:
The landowner, the residents and/or owners of or in the PUD may apply to the Planning Commission for an amendment to the master plan. The Planning Commission may approve such amendment so long as the original intent is not obrogated and the change does not in any way damage any part of the PUD nor any adjoining properties. Minor changes in the location, sitting, and height of the buildings may be authorized by the Planning Commission if required by engineering or other circumstances of the location not foreseen at the time of final approval. Other changes to the Master Plan, such as the number of dwelling units or a change of use of the lots must be submitted to both the Planning Commission and the Board of Mayor and Alderman for approval.
6. Subdivision Plat Required
A PUD may be subdivided and sold. When this is to be the case at the time of submission of the final master plan, a final subdivision plat shall also be submitted meeting the requirements for a final plat to be recorded in the office of the Lincoln County Registrar.
When the subdivision includes attached dwellings in either a horizontal or vertical relationship, the final plat shall also contain an "as-built" building and boundary survey showing the complete and accurate dimensions and angles of the boundary of the parcel(s) on which the unit is located. In a vertical relationship (for example a second floor apartment) the plat must contain a datum plane of other suitable location reference. In meeting this requirement it is necessary that the upper and lower limits of each level of each dwelling unit be identified specifically in relation to the vertical reference.
6-127
7. Building Reconstruction
In the event a building is substantially damaged or destroyed by fire or natural disaster, such building may be reconstructed in exact compliance with the approved master plan. No change in any dimension or location shall be permitted without an official amendment approved by the Planning Commission.
8. Zoning Considerations
When an area is submitted for MPUD approval, the Planning Commission in its deliberations shall consider the character of the proposed development in relationship to the surrounding area. No such development shall be approved where the streets providing access cannot handle the additional traffic load nor where the water system is incapable of meeting the fire flow requirements.
The development shall be so planned, designed, and constructed so as to avoid undue traffic congestion in the surrounding area and provide a satisfactory relationship of land use of the planned unit development with the surrounding area, making use of landscaping, screening, open space, and building placement where required and in keeping with accepted land planning principals.
9. Time Table
After final approval, the developer has one year to begin construction on the project. If construction has not begun, the Master Plan will expire and the developer will need to request approval from the Planning Commission to start the project again. In addition, if construction has begun and has ceased for over a year, the Master Plan and Zoning Classification will terminate and return back to its prior zoning classification. In either circumstance, the developer can request from the Planning Commission to reinstate the Master Plan and the Zoning Designation.
10. Enforcement
The provisions of this chapter shall be enforced in the manner provided elsewhere in Fayettevilles Zoning Ordinances. Any development that is not otherwise in conformance with these regulations shall not be approved.
11. Performance Bond
Any application for final site plan approval shall be accompanied by a performance bond in the amount of the estimated cost of site improvements including, but not limited to water and sewer installation, parking lot and driveway paving, construction of fencing, screening, and landscaping. Such bond may be in form of cash, certified check, irrevocable letter of credit, or surety bond.
6-128
In the event that the applicant fails to comply with the approved site plan, the Building Inspector shall cause the bond to be forfeited and have the necessary improvements constructed or completed. The time for completion may be extended with the permission of the planning commission, upon the owner-builder furnishing a bond or letter of credit for any approved extended period. Posting of the required performance bond by the developer shall constitute prior permission for the proper designated parties to enter upon said property to complete these improvements.

CHAPTER 7
EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS
SECTION
14-701 Scope
14-702 Nonconforming Uses
14-703 Bulk and Lot Size Noncompliance
14-704 Exceptions to Height Limitations
14-705 Lots of Record
14-706 Exceptions to Setback Requirements
14-707 Absolute Minimum Lot Size
14-701 SCOPE
CHAPTER 7, of this ordinance, is devoted to providing for the necessary exceptions and modifications to the supplementary provisions and the specific zoning district provisions provided in CHAPTER 5 and CHAPTER 6.
14-702 NONCONFORMING USES
The districts established in this ordinance (as set forth in district regulations in CHAPTER 6) are designed to guide the future use of land in Fayetteville, Tennessee, by encouraging the development of desirable residential, commercial, and industrial areas with appropriate groupings of compatible, and related uses and thus promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
As a necessary corollary, in order to carry out such purposes, nonconforming uses which adversely affect the development of such areas must be subject to certain limitations. The provisions governing nonconforming uses set forth in this chapter are therefore established to contain the existing undesirable conditions resulting from such incompatible nonconforming uses, which are detrimental to the achievement of such purposes. While such uses are generally permitted to continue, this ordinance is designed to restrict any expansion of such uses beyond the site which the use occupied upon the effective date of this ordinance.
In the case of buildings or other structures not complying with the bulk regulations of this ordinance, the provisions governing noncomplying buildings or other structures set forth in this chapter are established in order to permit the continued use of such buildings or other structures, but to limit the creation of additional noncompliance or increase in the degree of noncompliance.
These provisions are thus designed to preserve the character of the districts established in this ordinance in light of their suitability to particular uses, and thus to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
7-2
14-702.1 Provisions Governing Nonconforming Uses
1. Applicability
The provisions of this chapter are applicable to all uses which are not permitted within the districts in which they are located. Additionally, buildings and other structures located within the floodway are considered within the regulations of nonconforming uses.
2. Construction or Use Permit Approved Prior to Ordinance Adoption
Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall layout, plans, construction, site or designated use of any development, building, structure, or part thereof where official approvals and required building permits have been granted before the enactment of this ordinance, or any amendment thereto, the construction of which, conforming with such plans, shall have been started prior to the effective date of this ordinance and completion thereof carried on in a normal manner within the subsequent six (6) months period, and not discontinued until completion except for reasons beyond the builder's control.
In the event that the activity or construction of such building or other structures is not substantially underway and being diligently pursued within the six (6) month period following the issuance of a building permit, then such permit shall automatically lapse and the provisions of this ordinance shall apply.
3. Repairs and Alterations
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by proper authority.
4. Zone Lot Containing Nonconforming Use
A zone lot containing a nonconforming use shall not be reduced in area, except to comply with Subsection 14-702.1, 3.
5. Continuation of Nonconforming Use
Any nonconforming use which existed lawfully at the time of enactment of this ordinance and which remains nonconforming under the provisions contained herein or any use which shall become nonconforming upon enactment of this ordinance, or any subsequent amendments thereto, may be allowed to continue in operation and be permitted provided that no change in use is undertaken.
7-3
6. Change of Nonconforming Use
a. General Provisions
For the purpose of this chapter, a change in use is a change to another use either under the same activity type or any other activity type or major class of activity; however, a change in occupancy or ownership shall not, by itself, constitute a change of use.
A nonconforming use may be changed to any conforming use, and the applicable bulk regulations and accessory off-street parking requirements shall apply to such change of use or to alterations made in order to accommodate such conforming use.
b. Nonconforming to Conforming Use
Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
7. Expansion of Nonconforming Uses
a. General Provisions

b. Adequate Space for Expansion
No expansion of any nonconforming use shall infringe upon, or increase the extent of any infringement existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance, upon any open space required by this ordinance. All required yard setback requirements must be adhered to in any such expansion project.
c. Expansion Limited
Any expansion of a nonconforming use permitted under the provisions of this section shall take place only upon the zone lot(s) on which said use was operating at the time the use became nonconforming. Nothing within this provision shall be construed so as to permit expansion of any nonconforming use through the acquisition and development of additional land.
d. Expansion upon Land Subject to Flood
No expansion of any nonconforming use shall violate the provisions of Section 14-608.
7-4
8. Damage or Destruction
a. General Provisions

b. Change in Use Prohibited
No reconstruction of damaged or destroyed facilities may occur which shall act to change the nonconforming use (as regulated in Subsection 14-702.1, 7) to other than a permitted use.
c. Land with Incidental Improvements
In all districts, a nonconforming use of land not involving a building or structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land shall be changed only to a conforming use.
d. Infringement upon Open Space Restricted
No reconstruction of damaged or destroyed facilities utilized by a nonconforming use shall increase the extent of any infringement upon any open space required by this ordinance.
e. Reconstruction of Flood Damaged Property
The provisions of Section 14-703, shall apply to the reconstruction of all buildings and structures associated with any nonconforming use located within a floodway district.
9. Discontinuance (Amended by Ordinance 2008-11, June 12, 2008)
When a nonconforming use of land or the active operation of substantially all the nonconforming uses in any building or other structure or tract of land is discontinued in a residential use for a period of one (1) year; or in a commercial or industrial use the allotted amount of time is thirty (30) continuous months, then the land of building or other structure shall thereafter be used only for conforming use. Intent to resume active operations shall not affect the forgoing provision.
14-703 BULK AND LOT SIZE NONCOMPLIANCE

D. Enlargements or Conversions
A noncomplying building or other structure may be enlarged or converted, provided that no enlargement or conversion may be made which would either create a new noncompliance or increase the degree of noncompliance of any portion of a building or other structure or parcel.
E. Damage or Destruction of Noncomplying Uses
A noncomplying building which is damaged or destroyed may be reconstructed, provided that the reconstruction will not either create a new noncompliance or increase the degree of noncompliance of a building or structure or parcel or portion thereof.

A. Where the owner of a lot consisting of one (1) or more adjacent lots of official record at the time of the adoption of this ordinance does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the yard or other requirements of this ordinance, an application may be submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance from the terms of this ordinance. Such lot may be used as a building site, provided, however, that the yard and other requirements of the district are complied with as closely as possible in the opinion of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
B. No lot which is now or hereafter built upon shall be so reduced in area that the yards and open space will be smaller than prescribed in Section 14-707, of this ordinance, and no yard, court, or open space provided around any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions hereof, shall again be considered as a yard, court, or other open space for another building.
7-6

Where two (2) or more lots of record with a continuous frontage are under the same ownership, or where a substandard lot of record has continuous frontage with a larger tract under the same ownership, such lots shall be combined to form one (1) or more building sites meeting the minimum requirements of the district in which they are located.
14-706 EXCEPTIONS TO SETBACK REQUIREMENTS
The front setback requirement of this ordinance for dwellings shall not apply to any lot where the average depth of existing setbacks on the developed lots located within one hundred (100) feet on each side of such lot is less than the minimum required front yard depth. In such cases, the front yard setback may be less than required but not less than the average of the existing depth for front yards on developed lots within one hundred (100) feet on each side of the lot. In residential districts, however, the setback shall in no case be less than fifteen (15) feet from the street right-of-way line.

The purpose of this variance is to modify the strict application of the specific requirements of this ordinance in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his land.

C. Fee
A fee determined by the Planning Commission Schedule of Fees adopted by the Board of Mayor and Adlermen will determine the amount charged to cover review and processing of each application for a variance, except that the fee shall be waived for a governmental agency.

2. The conditions upon which the petition for a variance is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same district.

5. The variance is the minimum variance that will relieve such difficulties or hardship and thereby make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
6. The variance will not authorize activities otherwise excluded from the particular district in which requested.
7. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare, injurious to other property or improvements in the area in which the subject property is located, or a substantial impairment to the intent and purpose of the zoning district wherein such property is located or of the general provisions of this ordinance.
8. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety.

1-105 Interpretation, Conflict, and Severability
1-105.1 Interpretation
These regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion
of health, safety, and general welfare.
1-105.2 Conflict with Public and Private Provisions
1-105.201 Public Provisions
These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any
other ordinance, rule, or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. Where
any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control.
1-105.202 Private Provisions
These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or
any other private agreement or restriction; provided, that where these
regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards than such
easement, covenant, or other private agreement or restriction, the
requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where any private provision exceeds the standards set forth herein, such
shall be considered a private contract between the parties of interest, and as
such is beyond the jurisdiction of the planning commission.
1-105.3 Severability
If any part or provision of these regulations or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part, provision, or application
directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered
and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances. The planning commission
hereby declares that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations
without any such part, provision, or application.
1-106 Saving Provision
These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or by
virtue of prior subdivision regulations; or as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering
any penalty accruing or about to accrue; or as affecting the liability of any person; or as
waiving any right of the planning commission under any section or provision existing at the
time of adoption of these regulations; or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any
person by lawful action of the planning commission, except as expressly provided
otherwise in these regulations.

1-106.1 Previously Approved Subdivisions
1-106.101 Unexpired Preliminary Approval
The approval granted on any plat prior to the effective date of these
regulations shall remain in force and effect for the time period stipulated by
the regulations under which the approval was first granted.
1-106.102 Expired Preliminary Approval
In any instance in which the period of preliminary approval shall have passed
with some portion of the subdivision not having received final approval, and
the applicant wishes an extension of the preliminary approval, the planning
commission may:
a. permit the remaining portion of the subdivision to be constructed and
to receive approval under provisions set forth in the regulations
whereby preliminary approval was originally granted, or
b. stipulate that the plat is null and void and that a new plat be presented
subject to the provisions of these regulations.
In making this determination, the planning commission shall consider all
pertinent facts available to it. The current state and active pursuit of
construction and development activities within the subdivision shall be given
due consideration in the course of the planning commission's deliberation on
this question.
1-107 Amendments
1-107.1 Enactment
For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety, and general welfare the
planning commission may from time to time amend these regulations. Before the
adoption of any amendment to these regulations, a public hearing thereon shall be
held by the planning commission, as required by Chapter 3, Title 13, Tennessee
Code, at least thirty (30) days notice of the time and place of which shall be given in
a newspaper of general circulation.

numbered consecutively and printed on pages separate from any other
amendment and in a manner which fully states any language deleted from
these regulations and any language added and the place in the text of each
such change.
1-108 Resubdivision of Land
1-108.1 Procedures for Resubdivision
If any change in an approved or recorded subdivision plat would affect the layout of
any public street, alley, or road (hereinafter referred to as public way) shown on such
plat, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it would affect any
map, plan, or plat legally recorded before the adoption of any subdivision
regulations, such amendment shall be approved by the planning commission by the
same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
1-108.2 Procedures for Subdivision Where Future Resubdivision Is
Foreseen
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land or double the minimum required
area for any zoning district in which the lot is located, and the planning commission
has reason to believe that any such lot(s) will be resubdivided into smaller building
sites, the planning commission may require that the subdivision and development of
such parcel of land allow for the future opening of public ways and the ultimate
extension of adjacent public ways. The planning commission may also require that
dedications providing for the future opening and extension of such public ways be
indicated on the plat.
1-109 Conditions
Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions to land
subdivision are exercises of valid police power delegated by the state to the planning
commission. The developer has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions
imposed by the planning commission for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive
use of the land so as to provide for the physical and economical development of the
jurisdictional area and for the safety and general welfare of future plot owners in the
subdivision and of the community at large.
1-110 Vacation of Plats
Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the premises, at any time
before the sale of any lot described therein, by a written instrument, to which a copy of such
plat shall be attached, declaring the plat or part of the plat to be vacated. The planning
commission shall follow the same procedure for approval of plats. The planning
commission may reject any such instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in
any of its public uses, improvements, or public ways. Such an instrument shall be
executed, acknowledged, or approved, and duly recorded or filed; the instrument shall
operate to void the recorded plat and divest all public rights in the
6
public ways and public grounds and all dedications laid out or described in such plat.
When any lot or lots have been sold the plat may be vacated in the manner herein provided
only if all of the owners of lots in such platted area join in the execution of such writing.
1-111 Variances
1-111.1 General
If the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties
may result from strict compliance with these regulations, a variance from these
regulations may be granted; provided, such variance shall not have the effect of
nullifying the general intent and purpose of these regulations and provided, further,
that the planning commission shall not recommend variations unless it shall make
findings based upon written evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
1. the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health,
or welfare, or be injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located;
2. the conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to
the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally
to other property;
3. because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
condition of the specific property involved, a particular hardship (not selfimposed)
to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations were carried out; and
4. the variance will not in any manner alter the provisions of the land
development plan, the major street or road plan, or any zoning ordinance.
5. any approved variance should be reflected on the final plat.

may be specifically served to an equal or greater extent by an alternative proposal,
condition, or circumstance, if may approve other variations to these regulations.
1-111.2 Procedures
Each and every variance or modification of these subdivision regulations sought by
a subdivider shall be specifically applied for in the numerical order of the
subdivision regulations, in writing by the subdivider in letter form. Any condition
shown on the plat which would require a variance or modification shall constitute a
grounds for disapproval of the plat unless such special application for modification
variance is made. In approving any variation from these regulations the planning
commission shall state fully in the minutes the grounds for the variation and all of the
facts upon which the decision is made.

commission and/or staff assistant to the planning commission,
generally including a sketch plat, and discussion of the
proposed area to be subdivided.
(ii) Submittal of a preliminary plat, prepared in accordance with
Section 6-102, herein for planning commission approval.
20
(iii) Securing of approval from other public agencies.
(iv) Submittal of the final subdivision plat, prepared in accordance
with Section 6-104, herein for planning commission approval.
3-101.3 Official Submission Date
For the purpose of these regulations, for both major and minor subdivisions, the
date of the regular meeting of the planning commission at which the public hearing
on the final subdivision plat, including any adjourned date thereof, is closed, shall
constitute the official submittal date of the plat at which the statutory period required
in Section 13-3-404 and 13-4-304, Tennessee Code, for formal approval or
disapproval of the plat shall commence.
3-101.4 Policy on Flood Prone Areas
In determining the appropriateness of land subdivision at any site containing a flood
prone area, the planning commission, in reviewing any plat, shall consider the policy
and purpose set forth in Section 1-104, of these regulations, and, additionally:
1. the danger to life and property due to the increased flood heights or
velocities, either potential or actual, caused by subdivision fill, roads, and
intended uses;
2. the danger that intended uses or improvements may be swept onto other
lands or downstream to the injury of others;
3. the adequacy of proposed water supply, sanitation, and drainage systems,
and the ability of these systems to function under flood conditions;
4. the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage
and the effect of such damage upon the individual owner;
5. the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community at large;
6. the requirements of the subdivision for a waterfront location;
7. the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed
subdivision and land uses;
8. the compatibility of the proposed uses with existing development or
development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
9. the relationship of the proposed subdivision to the land development plan
and the floodplain management program for the area;
10. the safety of access to the property for emergency vehicles in times of flood;
21
11. the expected heights, duration, velocity, rate of rise, and sediment transport
of the floodwaters expected at the site;
12. the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, public ways, and bridges;
and
13. the effect of the proposed subdivision upon the planning commission's
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, if such planning
commission is, or elects to be, in the program.
No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved by the planning commission if
proposed levees, fills, structures, or other features within the subdivision will
individually or collectively, increase flood flows, heights, duration, or damages. The
regulatory limits (the one hundred-year flood level) shall be determined from the
latest approved flood study for the jurisdictional area, and any subsequent revisions
thereto. Specific engineering studies are to be formulated by the developer in those
areas in which flood data are not currently available, if deemed necessary by the
planning commission.
In any instance in which the planning commission determines that a proposed
subdivision may affect the flood height, velocity, or duration in any flood prone area
outside its jurisdiction, the commission shall take all actions necessary and proper
to ensure the coordinated review of the development with the appropriate
governmental agencies of the affected area.
In approving plans for subdivision of land containing flood prone areas, the planning
commission shall ensure that development will proceed in such a way that property
lying within any floodway, as defined by these regulations, will be maintained in a
manner as prescribed by any zoning ordinance. The planning commission shall
also ensure that development within any floodway fringe area (within the one
hundred-year flood level) will be protected adequately against potential flood
hazards by the methods prescribed in Article V, of these regulations.
The planning commission shall disapprove the subdivision of any land containing a
flood prone area when the commission determines that subdivision plans are not
consistent with the policy stated in this section.

commission, upon demand, and the applicant may proceed to apply for final
subdivision plat approval in the manner prescribed by Section 3-104, of these
regulations.
After the planning commission approves, conditionally approves, or disapproves the
preliminary plat, one copy of the proposed preliminary plat shall be returned to the
developer with the date of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval thereon. If
a preliminary plat is disapproved the planning commission shall state specific
reasons for disapproval which shall be entered into the minutes of the meeting.
Before the planning commission approves a preliminary plat showing land for any
public use, the planning commission shall obtain approval for the land reservation
from the appropriate governmental agency.
3-103.5 Public Improvements
The planning commission may require that all public improvements be installed and
dedicated prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat by the secretary of the
planning commission. If the planning commission does not require that all
25
public improvements be installed and dedicated prior to signing of the final
subdivision plat, an adequate performance bond shall be approved. The amount of
such bond shall be established by the planning commission based upon the
recommendation of the appropriate governmental representative or by receipt of
cost bids from two (2) or more independent contracting firms equal to the cost of all
necessary improvements plus an additional ten (10) percent to cover inflation shall
be added. It is the subdivider's responsibility to furnish these estimates to the
planning commission.
Such bond shall be submitted by the applicant at the time of application for final
subdivision plat approval. The planning commission shall require the applicant to
indicate on the plat all public ways and improvements to be dedicated; all districts
for water, fire, and utility improvements which shall be required to be established or

other legal entity (where open space or facilities are to be deeded to
a co-owners association by similar organization acting on behalf of
the joint owners of said property) charged with improving or
maintaining the open space or facilities, and declaration of covenants
and restrictions pertaining to each and every property within the
subdivision; and
(c) declaration of covenants and restrictions pertaining to open space
and facilities which assure the continued use of said facilities for the
purpose intended, where open space or facilities are to be retained
by the developer.
27
3-104.2 Endorsement of Notations
The notations and certifications required by Subsection 6-104.3, of these
regulations, to appear upon the final plat shall be endorsed by appropriate officials
and other persons prior to application for final subdivision plat approval, except that
the certificate of planning commission approval shall be signed at the time specified
in Section 3-105, of these regulations.
3-104.3 Hearing and Decision on Final Plat
The planning commission shall hold a hearing as required by Section 13-4-404 and
13-4-304, Tennessee Code, on each final plat brought before it. The planning
commission shall, within thirty (30) days after submission of the plat, approve,
modify, or disapprove the final subdivision plat by resolution, which shall set forth in
detail any conditions to which the approval is subject, or reasons for disapproval. In
no event shall the period of time stipulated by the planning commission for
completion of required improvements exceed one (1) year from the date of final
resolution.
Failure of the planning commission to act upon a plat within the prescribed time
shall be deemed approval of the plat, and in such event, a certificate of approval,
entitling the subdivider to proceed as specified in Subsection 3-104.4 and Section
3-105, of these regulations, shall be issued, upon demand, by the secretary of the
planning commission. The applicant, however, may agree to an extension of the
time for planning commission review.
One (1) copy of the final subdivision plat shall be returned to the subdivider with the
date of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval noted thereon.
3-104.4 Vested Rights
No vested rights shall accrue to any plat by reason of preliminary or final approval
until the actual signing of the plat by the secretary of the planning commission. All
requirements, conditions, or regulations adopted by the planning commission,
applicable to the particular subdivision or to all subdivisions generally, shall be
deemed a condition of approval for any subdivision prior to the time of the signing of
the final plat by the secretary of the planning commission. Where the planning
commission has required the installation of improvements prior to the signing of the
final plat, the planning commission shall not modify unreasonably the conditions set
forth in the resolution of final approval.
3-105 Signing and Recording of Subdivision Plat
3-105.1 Signing of Plat
1. When a bond is required, the secretary of the planning commission shall
endorse approval on the plat after the bond has been approved by the
planning commission and after all the conditions of the resolution pertaining
to the plat have been satisfied.
28
2. When installation of improvements is required, the secretary of the planning
commission shall endorse approval on the plat after all conditions of the
resolution have been satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily completed.
There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities have been
installed in a manner satisfactory to the planning commission as shown on
certifications by the appropriate governmental representative(s) that
necessary land dedications and improvements have been accomplished.
3. When the conditions of this section are satisfied, the secretary shall sign the
permanent reproducible original of the subdivision plat.
3-105.2 Recording of Plat
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to file plat with the county register's
office within fifteen (15) days of the date of signature. Simultaneously, with the filing
of the plat, the enforcing officer shall record the agreement of dedication together
with such legal documents as shall be required to be recorded by legal counsel.
3-105.3 Sectionalizing Major Subdivision Plats
Prior to granting final approval of a major subdivision plat, the planning commission
may permit the plat to be divided into two (2) or more sections and may impose
such conditions upon the filing of each section as it may deem necessary to assure
the orderly development of the subdivision.
The planning commission may require that a performance bond be in such amount
as is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer
the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the remaining
sections of the plat are offered for filing. The developer also may file irrevocable
offers to dedicate public ways and improvements in the section offered to be filed
and defer filing offers of dedication for the remaining sections until such sections,
subject to any conditions imposed by the planning commission, shall be granted
concurrently with final approval of the plat. Such authorized sections must contain at
least ten (10) percent of the total number of lots contained in the proposed plat
unless a specific waiver of this requirements is granted by the planning commission.
29
ARTICLE IV
ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS
4-101 Improvements and Performance Bond
4-101.1 Completion of Improvements
Before the final subdivision plat is signed by the planning commission officer
specified in Subsection 3-105.1, of these regulations, all applicants shall complete,
in accordance with the planning commission's decision and to the satisfaction of the
appropriate governmental representative, all public way, sanitary, and other
improvements, including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision,
as required in these regulations and approved by the planning commission, and
shall dedicate such improvements to the appropriate governing body free and clear
of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus
dedicated.
4-101.2 Surety Instrument
The planning commission at its discretion may waive the requirement that the
applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to the signing of the
final subdivision plat by providing that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at
the time of submission for final subdivision approval in an amount estimated by the
planning commission as sufficient to guarantee to the governing body the
satisfactory construction, installation, and dedication of the incompleted portion of
required improvements. (See Subsection 3-103.5).
Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be
satisfactory to legal counsel as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution, as set
forth in these regulations. The period within which required improvements must be
completed shall be specified by the planning commission in the resolution
approving the final subdivision plat and shall be incorporated in the bond and shall
not exceed two (2) years from date of final approval.
Such bond shall be approved by the planning commission as to amount and
conditions. The planning commission may, upon proof of difficulty, extend the
completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one (1) additional
year. The planning commission may accept at any time during the period of such
bond a substitution of principal.
4-101.3 Temporary Improvements
The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required
by the planning commission, and shall maintain them to a reasonable satisfaction
for the period specified by the planning commission. Prior to construction of any
temporary facility or improvement, the applicant shall file with the planning
commission a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which shall ensure
that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed.
30
4-101.4 Costs of Improvements
All required improvements shall be made by the applicant at his expense. Any
provisions for reimbursement by the governing body or any utility agency shall be
stipulated clearly in the provisions of any bonds.
4-101.5 Governmental Units
Governmental units to which these bonds and contract provisions apply may file, in
lieu of said contract or bond, a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or
agencies authorized to act in their behalf agreeing to comply with the provisions of
this article.
4-101.6 Failure to Complete Improvements
In subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if the
improvements are not completed within the period specified by the planning
commission in the resolution approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to
have expired. In those cases in which a performance bond has been posted and
required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such
performance bond, the planning commission thereupon may declare the bond to be
in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent
of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
4-101.7 Acceptance of Dedication Offers
Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of public ways, easements, and parks
shall be by formal action of the governing body. Such action shall be in the form of a
resolution recommended by the planning commission to the governing body. The
approval by the planning commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to
constitute or imply an acceptance by the local government of any public way,
easement, or other ground shown on the plat. The planning commission may
require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect.
4-102 Inspection of Improvements
4-102.1 General Procedure
The planning commission may provide for inspection of required improvements
during construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. If the appropriate
governmental representative finds upon inspection that any of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the governing body's
construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for
completing the improvements to the required standards. Whenever the cost of
improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the bonding
company shall be liable severally and jointly for completing said improvements
according to specifications.
31
4-102.2 Release or Reduction of Performance Bond
4-102.201 Certificate of Satisfactory Completion
The planning commission shall not recommend dedication of required public
improvements nor shall the planning commission release nor reduce a
performance bond until the appropriate governmental representative submits
a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily
completed, and until the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the
planning commission and the appropriate governmental representative
(through submission of a detailed "as built" survey of the subdivision
indicating location, dimensions, construction materials, a listing of deviations
made during construction, and any other information required by the planning
commission) that the layout and the line and grade of all public improvements
are in accordance with the approved construction plans for the subdivision.
Upon such approval and recommendation, the governing body, thereafter,
may accept the dedicated improvements in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Subsections 1-112.107 and 4-101.7, of these regulations.
4-102.202 Reduction of Performance Bond
A performance bond may be reduced upon actual dedication and
acceptance of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the public
improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the plat.
In no event shall a performance bond be reduced below twenty-five (25)
percent of the principal amount prior to final acceptance of all items covered
under the bond.
4-103 Maintenance of Improvements
The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements including all lot improvements,
until acceptance of the public improvements by the governmental body.
The applicant may be required to file a maintenance bond with the planning commission
prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the appropriate governmental
representative and in a form satisfactory to legal counsel in order to assure the satisfactory
condition of the required improvements, including all lot improvements, for a period of one
year after the date of acceptance of the public improvements by the planning commission.
4-104 Deferral or Waiver of Required Improvements
The planning commission may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject to
appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such improvements as, in its judgment,
are not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which
are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
Whenever it is deemed necessary by the planning commission to defer the construction of
any improvement required herein because of incompatible grades, future planning,
inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or other reasons, the developer shall either
32
pay his share of the costs of the future improvements to the planning commission prior to
signing of the final subdivision plat by the appropriate governmental representative(s) or
post a bond or other surety instrument ensuring completion of said improvements upon
demand of the planning commission.
4-105 Escrow Deposits for Lot Improvements
4-105.1 Acceptance of Escrow Funds
Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvements required by
these regulations cannot be performed, the enforcing officer nevertheless may issue
a certificate of occupancy upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to
be determined by the appropriate governmental representative for the cost of such
improvements; provided, there otherwise is no danger to the health, safety, or
general welfare. The performance bond covering such lot improvements shall
remain in full force and effect.
4-105.2 Procedures on Escrow Fund
All required improvements for which escrow moneys have been accepted by the
enforcing officer at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be
installed by the developer within a period of nine (9) months from the date of deposit
and issuance of the certificate of occupancy. In the event that the improvements
have not been installed properly at the end of the time period, the enforcing officer
shall provide written notice of two (2) weeks to the developer requiring him to install
the improvements, and in the event they are not installed properly, in the judgment of
the enforcing officer, he may request the planning commission to proceed to install
or to contract for the installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to
exceed the amount of the escrow deposit.
At the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow moneys
are being deposited, the applicant shall obtain and file with the enforcing officer,
prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy, a notarized statement from the
purchaser(s) of the premise authorizing the enforcing officer to install the
improvements at the end of the nine (9) month period in the event the improvements
have not been installed properly by the developer.
4-106 Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy
A. Where a performance bond has been required for a subdivision, or any section of a
subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision or section
thereof shall be issued prior to the completion and dedication of the improvements
to the appropriate governmental unit, as required in the planning commission's
resolution of final approval of the subdivision plat.
B. The extent of public way improvements shall be adequate for vehicular access by
the prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment prior to the issuance of
an occupancy certificate. The developer shall at the time of the dedication submit
monies in escrow to the planning commission in a sum to be determined by the
appropriate governmental representative.
33
C. No building permit shall be issued for the final ten (10) percent of lots in a
subdivision, or if ten (10) percent be less than two (2) lots, for the final two (2) lots of
a subdivision, until all public improvements required by the planning commission's
resolution of final plat approval have been fully completed, dedicated, and accepted
by the governmental body.
34
ARTICLE V
REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS, RESERVATIONS, AND DESIGN
5-101 General Requirements

with all applicable laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules, or regulations, including, but
not limited to:
1. all applicable provisions of Tennessee Law, regulations, or policy;
2. any zoning ordinance, any building and housing codes, and all other
applicable laws or policies of the planning commission;
3. the adopted general plan and major road or street (public way) plan;
4. the rules of the county health department and the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation;
5. the rules, as applicable, of the Federal Highway Administration or
Tennessee Department of Transportation, if the subdivision or any lot
contained therein abuts a nonlocal highway; and
6. the standards and regulations adopted by all other boards, commissions,
and agencies of the planning commission, where applicable.
Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity with the above
rules or with the provisions set forth in Section 2-104, of these regulations.
5-101.2 Self-Imposed Restrictions
If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the subdivision
greater than those required by any zoning ordinance or these regulations, such
restrictions or reference thereto shall be recorded with the county register along with
the final subdivision plat in the office of the county register. Enforcement of selfimposed
restrictions shall be the responsibility of the developer or self-appointed
organization and not of the City.
5-101.3 Boundaries and Corners
The subdivider shall have iron pins placed in the subdivision as required herein by a
licensed surveyor. Iron pins shall be located and set as follows.
1. Iron pins shall be located on public way right-of-way lines, at public way
intersections, and at the beginning and ending point of curves. Iron pins shall
be spaced so as to be within sight of each other.
35
2. The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be located in the field by iron
pins of durable material securely embedded. These iron pins shall be
placed not more than fourteen hundred (1,400) feet apart in any straight line
and at all corners or breaks at each end of all curves, at the point where a
curve changes its radius, at all angle points in any line, and at all angle points
along a meander line, except that when such corners or points fall within a
public way or proposed future public way, the iron pins shall be placed on the
side line of the public way.
3. All external and internal boundaries and those corners and points not
referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be located in the field by like iron
pins as described above. Such iron pins shall be placed at each end of all
curves, at a point where a curve changed its radius, and at all angle points in
any line. All lot corners not falling on any of the above described points shall
be marked by iron pins at least eighteen (18) inches long and one-half (1/2)
inch in diameter.
4. The lines of lots that extend to rivers or streams shall be marked in the field
by iron pins at least eighteen inches (18) inches long and one-half (1/2) inch
in diameter or by round or square iron bars at least eighteen (18) inches
long. Such pins shall be placed at the point of intersection of the river or
stream and lot line.
5. All pins shall be properly set in the ground by a surveyor prior to the time the
planning commission recommends approval of the final plat or release of the
bond where bond is made in lieu of improvements.
5-101.4 Character of the Land
Land which the planning commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations,
adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which
would be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of inhabitants of the land
and surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate
methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the planning
commission, upon recommendation of any staff assistant serving the planning
commission and/or other governmental representative, if any, to solve the problems
created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for such
uses as will not involve such a danger.
Where protection against flood damage is necessary, in the opinion of the planning
commission, flood-damage protection techniques may include, as deemed
appropriate by the planning commission:
1. the imposition of any surety and deed restrictions enforceable by the
planning commission to regulate the future type and design of uses within the
flood prone areas; and
2. flood protection measures designed so as not to increase, either individually
or collectively, flood flows, height, duration, or damages, and so as not to
infringe upon the regulatory floodway.
36
3. installation of flood warning systems.
4. the use of fill, dikes, levees, and other protective measures.
5. the use of floodproofing measures, shall be in compliance with local zoning
and building codes.
The acceptability of any flood protection methods formulated by the subdivider or
his agent shall be determined by the planning commission, which shall be guided by
the policies set forth in Section 1-104 and Subsection 3-101.4, of these regulations.
All such flood protection measures shall be designed so as not to increase, either
individually or collectively, flood flows, heights, duration, or damages so as not to
infringe upon the regulatory floodway.
5-101.5 Subdivision Name
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely
approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision in the area covered by
these regulations. The planning commission shall have authority to apporve the
name of the subdivision which shall be determined at sketch or preliminary plat
approval.
5-102 Lot Requirements
5-102.1 Lot Arrangement
5-102.101 General
The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography, flood hazards, or other conditions in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with any zoning
ordinance and state and county public health department regulations and in
providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved public
way.
5-102.102 Lots Subject to Flood
Where a lot in any flood prone area must be improved to provide a building
site free from flooding, such improvements shall be made outside the
floodway by elevation or fill to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation
(one hundred-year flood) for a distance extending at least twenty-five (25)
feet beyond the limits of intended structures and, additionally, extending a
sufficient distance to include areas for subsurface sewage disposal if the lot
is not to be connected to a public sanitary sewer system. Any fill shall be
protected against erosion by rip-rap, vegetative cover, or other methods
deemed acceptable by the planning commission.
37
In nonresidential building sites outside a floodway but subject to flooding, the
use of structural floodproofing methods specified in Subsection
5-101.4, of these regulations, as an alternative to landfill, may be approved
by the planning commission, as provided in Subsection 3-101.4, of these
regulations.
5-102.103 Lots Located on Steep Slopes
Due to the potential threat to health and safety posed by development
located on lands with slopes in excess of fifteen (15) percent, the following
regulations shall apply.
a. Site Development Plan Required -- No building permit shall be issued
for a building on any lot with slopes fifteen (15) percent or over until a
site plan meeting the following requirements has been approved by
the planning commission. Said site plan shall show:
(i) The exact size, shape, and location of the lot,
(ii) The proposed location of all buildings, driveways,
drainageways, and utilities,
(iii) Proposed contours at vertical intervals of no more than five (5)
feet,
(iv) The extent of natural tree cover and vegetation,
(v) The location of any onsite soil absorption sewage disposal
systems,
(vi) The type and location of erosion control methodology.
(vii) The surveyor's or engineer's stamp that prepared the plan,
(viii) Certification as to the stability of the structures and slope and
compliance with sound construction methods for areas with
steep slopes and landslide problems by a registered civil or
geotechnical engineer.
b. Site Development Standards -- The following standards shall be used
as a guide in determining the suitability of the construction proposed
for the particular site in question. The engineer's certification required
in Subsection 5-102.103, a, (viii), above, shall address these
standards.
(i) Natural vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible,
(ii) Natural drainageways and systems shall be maintained,
except that surface water may be diverted around a house or
slope area to a natural drain using acceptable construction
techniques,
38
(iii) Operations that increase loads, reduce slope support, and
cause instability of the slope shall be prohibited to the
maximum extent possible which will permit reasonable
development of the site. These include filling, irrigation
systems, accessory buildings, and onsite soil absorption
sewage disposal systems,
(iv) Where sanitary sewers are not available any onsite sewage
disposal system shall be shown on the site plan and located to
avoid slide-prone areas. Said system shall be approved by
the county health department prior to the planning
commission's review taking into account these requirements,
(v) Erosion control measures shall be employed to prevent all soil
material from leaving the site. Additionally, soil from
excavation on the site shall not be disposed as fill on a
potential slide area,
(vi) No construction which would cut the top of the slope shall be
permitted. This shall apply as well to subdivision roads
constructed in compliance with these regulations.
5-102.2 Lot Dimensions
Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of any zoning ordinance,
where applicable. Where lots are more than double the minimum area required by
any zoning ordinance, the planning commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future public ways
where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with
any zoning ordinance and these regulations. Generally side lot lines shall be at right
angles to street lines or radial to curving street lines.
The minimum lot frontage on a public way shall be fifty (50) feet, except for lots
fronting on a cul-de-sac which shall be thirty (30) feet.
Dimensions of the corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback requirements from both public
way rights-of-way.
Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and
loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, and as
established in any zoning ordinance.
Where there is no zoning, the minimum lot for an individual wasterwater disposal
system, shall be not less than one (1) acre. (Amended by Resolution, November
27, 2007)
39
5-102.3 Building Setback Lines
In the case of electric transmission lines where easement widths are not definitely
established, a minimum building setback line from the center of the transmission
line shall be established as follows:
Voltage of Line Building Setback
7.2 KV 15 feet
13 KV 25 feet
46 KV 37 1/2 feet
69 KV 50 feet
161 KV 75 feet
In the absence of zoning in the Urban Growth Boundary, the front yard building
setback line shall be a minimum of thirty-five (35 feet from the street right-of-way
lines. Other minimum building setback lines shall be as follows: (Added by
Resolution, September 23, 2003)
1. from side property line 10 feet
2. from rear property line 15 feet
3. front yard setback from street right-of-way 35 feet
5-102.4 Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots
5-102.401 Double Frontage Lots
Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where
necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arterials, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation.
5-102.402 Access from Arterial or Collector Public Ways
The planning commission may require that lots shall not derive access
exclusively from arterial or collector public ways. Where driveway access
from such public ways may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the
planning commission may require that the lots be served by a combined
access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards. Driveways shall be
designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back onto
arterial or collector public ways.
5-102.5 Soil Preservation, Grading, Erosion Control, and Seeding
5-102.501 Soil Preservation and Final Grading
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until grading has been completed
in accordance with the approved construction plan.
40
5-102.502 Lot Drainage
Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all
buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general
storm drainage pattern for the area which includes subsurface drainage.
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage
water from each lot to adjacent lots.
The planning commission reserves the right to set minimum elevations on all
floors, patios, and building equipment. This prerogative to establish
elevation exists in addition to any ordinances that refer to floodplain elevation
requirements. The content of the preceding paragraph is to give summary
review powers over any calculated or historical evidence of storm water
presence in overland or channel conditions.
The subdivision developer will insure that all artesian ground waters of a
permanent or temporary nature will be intercepted and carried away to
primary drainage conduits along swaled ditches or in underground pipes on
property line easements. Regardless of the location of property lines,
intercept will be allowed by the planning commission at the point of artesian
surfacing. The intent of this paragraph is to prevent flooding by overland flow.
The developer is obligated to perform this work upon evidence of artesian
water for a period of one (1) year following acceptance of all roads and
utilities.
Any sinkhole or natural channel which serve at any time as a means of
moving ground water into the subterran will be protected by a structure as
approved by the planning commission. The allowed alternative to this is the
construction of an alternative means of storm water relief as approved by the
planning commission. In any event, location and elevation of future
construction will be designated to allow for the worst possible conditions.
5-102.503 Erosion and Sediment Control
There shall be a minimization of changes in the rate of natural erosion and
sedimentation which result from the development process. An erosion and
sediment control plan shall be presented with the construction plans
submitted in conformance with Section 6-103, of these regulations. Such
plans shall incorporate the following principals:
a. clearing and grading shall be integrated with layout design;
b. clearing shall be minimized and existing vegetation shall be
preserved to the maximum feasible degree;
c. grading shall be strictly limited to those areas involved in current
construction activities;
d. disturbed areas shall be protected and stabilized as soon as
possible;
41
e. structural and vegetative measures to control the velocity and volume
of runoff shall be required;
f. sediment basins and traps shall be required as necessary;
g. adequate maintenance of all planting and structures measures shall
be assured.
5-102.6 Debris and Waste
No cut trees, timber, debris, junk, rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall
be buried in any land or left or deposited on any lot or public way at the time of the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the lot, and removal of such waste shall be
required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy. Neither shall any such
waste be left nor deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of
the performance bond or dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner.
5-102.7 Fencing
Each subdivider or developer shall be required to furnish and install all fences
wherever the planning commission determines that a hazardous condition exists.
Such fences shall be constructed according to standards established by the
planning commission, as appropriate, and shall be noted on the final plat. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any affected lot until such fence
improvements have been installed.
5-102.8 Water Bodies and Watercourses
If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be
so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the owners
of adjacent lots. The planning commission may approve an alternative plan
whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body
is so placed that it will not become a governmental responsibility.
No more than ten (10) percent of the minimum area of a lot required under any
zoning ordinance may be satisfied by land which is under water. Where a
watercourse separates a buildable area of a lot from the public way by which it has
access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure
approved by the planning commission and no certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for a structure on such a lot until the installation is completed and approved
by the planning commission and/or the appropriate governmental representative.
5-103 Public Ways
5-103.1 General Requirements
5-103.101 Frontage on Improved Public Ways
No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided meets
the requirements for access set forth in Subsection 1-112.109, of these
42
regulations. If any new street construction or improvements are involved,
such shall be approved and, where public, dedicated as provided in Articles
III and IV, of these regulations. Any such public way must be suitably
improved to the standards required by this article or be bonded by a
performance bond required under these regulations, with the roadway and
right-of-way widths required by this article or the major street or road plan.
5-103.102 Grading and Improvement Plan
Public ways shall be graded and improved to conform to the standards
required by this section and shall be approved as to design and specification
by the appropriate governmental representative in accordance with the
specifications required herein. No surface shall be applied to the base of
any proposed public way prior to the approval of the final plat of the
subdivision or of the final approval of any section of the subdivision in
question without having been properly inspected.
5-103.103 Improvements in Floodable Areas
The finished elevation of proposed public ways subject to flood shall be no
more than one (1) foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation. The
planning commission may require profiles and elevations of public ways to
determine compliance with this requirement. All drainage structures shall be
sufficient to discharge flood flows without increasing flood height. Where fill
is used to bring the finished elevation of any public way to the required
elevation, such fill shall not encroach upon a floodway, and the fill shall be
protected against erosion by rip-rap, vegetative cover, or other methods
deemed acceptable by the planning commission.
5-103.104 Topography and Arrangement
a. All public ways shall be arranged so as to obtain as many of the
building sites as possible at or above the grades of the public ways.
Grades of public ways shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall
not be permitted. Specific design standards are contained in
Subsection 5-103.2, of these regulations.
b. All public ways shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of public ways and dedicated rights-of-way as
established on the major street or road plan or the land development
plan.
c. All public ways shall be properly related to special traffic generators,
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and
shopping areas or centers; to population densities; and to the pattern
of existing and proposed land use.
43
d. Minor public ways shall be laid out to conform to the topography; to
discourage use by through traffic; to permit efficient drainage and
utility systems; and to require the minimum ways necessary to provide
convenient and safe access to property.
e. Proposed public ways shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided in order to provide advantageous future
development of adjacent tracts.
f. In business and industrial developments, public ways and other
access routes shall be planned in connection with the grouping of
buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck
loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas, so as
to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic,
including pedestrian traffic.
5-103.105 Blocks
a. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of
appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major public ways, railroads, or
waterways.
b. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to:
(i) provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated;
(ii) any zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions;
(iii) needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic; and
(iv) limitations and opportunities of topography.
c. Block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed sixteen hundred
(1,600) feet nor be less than two hundred (200) feet, except as the
planning commission deems necessary to secure efficient use of land
or desired features of the public way pattern. Wherever practicable,
blocks along arterial or collector routes shall not be less than one
thousand (1,000) feet in length.
d Blocks designed for industrial or commercial uses shall be of such
length and width as may be deemed suitable by the planning
commission.
e. In any long block, the planning commission may require the
reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate
utilities, drainage, facilities, and/or pedestrian traffic.
44
A pedestrian walkway, not less than ten (10) feet wide, may be
required by the planning commission through the approximate center
of any block more than eight hundred (800) feet long, where deemed
essential to provide circulation or access to a school, playground,
shopping center, transportation facility, or other community facility.
5-103.106 Access to Arterials and Collectors
Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial
or collector route, the planning commission may require that access to such
public way be limited by:
a. the subdivision of lots so as to back on the arterial or collector route
and front on a parallel minor route;
b. a series of cul-de-sac, "U" shaped public ways, or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel public
way, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial
or collector route; or
c. a marginal access or service public way, separated from the arterial
or collector route by a planting or grass strip and having access
thereto at suitable points.
The number of residential or local public ways entering on arterial or collector
routes shall be kept to a minimum.
5-103.107 Reserve Strips
The creation of reserve strips adjacent to a proposed public way in such a
manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such public way shall
generally not be permitted.
However, in extraordinary circumstances the planning commission may allow
creation of a reserve strip to enable a more appropriate pattern of lots or
public ways. Where such is created the planning commission must agree to
any and all future depositions of same. A notation to this effect shall be
entered on the final plat or approved as an auxiliary instrument attached
thereto.
5-103.108 Arrangement of Continuing and Dead-End Public Ways
a. Arrangement of Continuing Public Ways -- The arrangement of public
ways shall provide for the continuation of major public ways between
adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for
convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient
provision of utilities, and when such continuation is in accordance with
the major street or road plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped
and the public way must be a dead-end public way temporarily, the
right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary culde-
sac, temporary T-, or L-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all
temporary dead-end public ways as required in
45
the following turnabout standards, with a notation on the subdivision
plat that land outside the normal public way right-of-way shall revert to
abutting property owners whenever the public way is continued.
b. Dead-End Public Ways -- Where a public way does not extend
beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not
required by the planning commission for access to adjoining property,
its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than fifty
(50) feet. However, the planning commission may require the
reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnabout shall be
provided at the end of a dead-end public way in accordance with the
design standards of these regulations.
For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent dead-end public ways shall, in general, be
limited in length in accordance with the design standards of these
regulations.
5-103.2 Design Standards
5-103.201 Purpose
In order to provide public ways of suitable location, width, and improvement
to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police,
fire-fighting, sanitation, and road-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate
public ways so as to compose a convenient and safe system and avoid
undue hardships to adjoining properties, the public way design standards set
forth in this section are hereby required. (Public way classification shall be
as indicated on the land development plan or major street or road plan;
otherwise, the public way shall be classified by the planning commission
according to the definitions in Article I, of these regulations.)
5-103.202 General Design
The general design of all public ways shall conform to the standards in the
tables entitled "General Design Standards for Public Ways", which follow,
hereafter.
5-103.203 Intersections
a. Public ways shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new public ways at
an angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be permitted.
An oblique public way should be curved approaching an intersection
and should be approximately at right angles for at least one hundred
(100) feet therefrom. Not more than two (2) public ways shall intersect
at any one point unless specifically approved by the planning
commission.

b. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing public way
shall coincide, wherever practicable, with any existing intersections on
the opposite side of such public way. Jogs within public ways having
center line offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall not be
permitted, except where the intersected public ways have separated
dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where
public ways intersect arterial or collector routes, their alignment shall
be continuous.
c. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) minor public ways
shall be twenty-five (25) feet, and minimum curb radius at an
intersection involving a collector public way shall be thirty (30) feet.
Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block
shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering
practice to permit safe vehicular movement.
d. Where a public way intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the subdivider shall cut such ground or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-ofway
to the extent necessary to provide adequate sight distance. The
extent of visibility shall comply with the local Zoning Ordinance.
e. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In
hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than a two (2) percent grade for a
distance of sixty (60) feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line
of the intersecting public way.
f. Where proposed subdivision public roadways enter and intersect with
existing roadways, the actual sight distance on the existing roadways
in both horizontal and vertical planes shall be equal to, or greater than,
the stopping sight distance specified by the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) policy on the
geometric design of highways and streets (1990) Table III-1. When
required by the Planning Commission, the owner/developer shall
secure and submit plan  profile surveys as a means of defining the
actual sight distance. (Added by Resolution 2005-01, July 26,
2005)
5-103.204 Excess Right-of-Way
A slope easement in excess of the right-of-way designated in these
regulations may be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is
necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be less
than three to one (3:1). Where solid rock is encountered slopes shall be onehalf
to one (1/2:1).
49
5-103.205 Bridges
Bridges of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the planning
commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the subdivider without
reimbursement from the planning commission.
5-103.3 Right-of-Way Width Dedication on Existing Public Ways
Where a subdivision adjoins an existing narrow public way or where the major street
or road plan or any zoning setback provisions indicate plans for realignment or
widening of a public way that would require use of some of the land in the
subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate, at his expense, areas for
widening or realigning such public way as set forth below:
1. the entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is
on both sides of the existing public way; or
2. when the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing public way,
one-half (1/2) of the required right-of-way, measured from the center line of
the existing pavement, shall be provided.
5-103.4 Public Way Surfacing and Improvements (Amended by
Resolution 02-2008, June 24, 2008)
After underground utilities have been installed, the subdivider shall construct curbs
with gutters inside the corporate limits; and, in no instance shall extruded curbs be
constructed within a public right-of-way except at entrances into private driveways or
parking lots. Where extruded curbs are used on private drives or parking lots, the
subdivider will place the curbs on the binder course, and the surface course will not
be placed until after the curbs are completed. Inside the planning region, but
outside the corporate limits, curbs are not required. Where required, all public ways
shall be surfaced or cause to be surfaced to the widths prescribed in these
regulations. No public way shall be surfaced until preliminary approval of the
subdivision plat has been obtained. Surfacing shall be of such character as is
suitable for the expected traffic. Types and methods of paving shall be according to
the specifications of the planning commission, but in no event shall such
construction be below the construction specifications set forth in Appendix B, of
these regulations. Adequate provisions shall be made for culverts or other drains,
and bridges, as required.
All public ways pavements, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, any
curb turnabouts, and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and
specifications adopted by the planning commission and shall be incorporated into
the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.
If the subdivision is located within the corporate limits of the City, the pavement for
the project may be provided and installed at the option of the City on the base
course constructed by the subdivider. The subdivider will coordinate and schedule
the paving work with the occurrence of the Director of Public Works.
50
5-104 Road Construction Specifications
The road construction specifications are included in these regulations as Appendix B, and
are adopted as a part hereof. These specifications shall be the minimum standards for
any subdivision within the jurisdictional area.
5-105 Drainage and Storm Sewers
5-105.1 General Requirements
The planning commission shall not approve any plat of a subdivision which does not
make adequate provisions for stormwater or floodwater run-off channels or basins.
The stormwater drainage system shall be separate and independent from any
sanitary sewer system.
All construction plans for drainage facilities, storm sewers, and detention facilities
shall be submitted with the Preliminary Plat: and shall be accompanied by the
design calculations used as a basis for the plans.
5-105.2 Nature of Stormwater Facilities
5-105.201 Location
The subdivider may be required by the planning commission to transport by
pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist prior to or as a
result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the
public way right-of-way, where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed
easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed in accordance with
the construction specifications contained in these regulations.
5-105.202 Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers
a. Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the developer shall install
storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of
stormwaters, subject to the specifications of the appropriate
governmental representative; inspection of facilities shall be
conducted by the enforcing officer to assure compliance.
b. If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as
determined by the planning commission, the subdivider shall make
arrangements for future stormwater disposal by a public system at the
time the plat receives final approval. Provisions for such connection
shall be incorporated by inclusion in the performance bond required
for the final subdivision plat.
5-105.203 Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas
A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to
accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the subdivision. Necessary facilities shall be
51
sized based on the construction specifications and assuming conditions of
maximum potential watershed development permitted by any zoning
ordinance.
5-105.204 Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas
a. The planning commission also shall study the effect of each
subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the
area of the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the additional
runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an
existing downstream drainage facility, the planning commission may
withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for
adequate improvement of such drainage facilities in such sum as the
planning commission shall determine. No subdivision shall be
approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate
drainage watercourse or facility.
b. Detention facilities shall be provided in each subdivision as required
by the Planning Commission in order to reduce the downstream
impact of increased runoff. Storage basins shall be of volume equal
to the difference between pre-development and post-development
runoff for the 25-year storm return frequency. Outlet works shall
accommodate a maximum flow equal to the pre-development flow for
the 25-year storm return frequency. Emergency overflow spillways
shall accommodate a minimum flow equal to the post-development
flow for the 100-year storm return frequency. Multiple outlet works
structures may be used to spread the basin discharge and reduce
erosion impacts downstream.
5-105.205 Areas of Poor Drainage
Whenever a plat is submitted for an area which is subject to flooding, the
planning commission may approve such subdivision; provided, that the
applicant fills the affected floodway fringe area of said subdivision to place
public way elevations at no more than twelve (12) inches below the regulatory
flood elevation and first floor elevations (including basements) at no less than
one (1) foot above the regulatory flood elevation. The plat of such
subdivision shall provide for a floodway along the bank of any stream or
watercourse of width sufficient to contain or move the water of the regulatory
flood, and no fill shall be placed in the floodway; neither shall any building nor
flood-restrictive structure be erected or placed therein. The boundaries of
the floodway and floodway fringe area, and the regulatory flood elevation,
shall be determined by the planning commission based upon the review
specified in Subsection 3-103.2, of these regulations and the submission of
flood data in construction plans as specified in Section 6-103, of these
regulations.
5-105.206 Floodplain Areas
The planning commission may when it deems it necessary for the health,
safety, or welfare of the present and future population of the area or
necessary to the conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities,
prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the
52
floodplain of any stream or drainage course. The regulatory floodway shall
be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from clearing,
grading, or dumping of earth, waste material, or stumps. Any subdivision
which contains flood prone land shall be subject to the special provisions set
forth in Subsections 3-101.4; 5-101.4; Section 5-104; and Subsection 5-
105.2, of these regulations.
5-105.3 Dedication of Drainage Easements
5-105.301 General Requirements
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or
stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-ofway
conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse and of such
width and construction as will be adequate. Where open drainageways are
utilized they shall be designed for the twenty-five (25) year frequency flood.
5-105.302 Drainage Easements
a. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impracticable the inclusion of drainage facilities within a public way
right-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least twenty (20)
feet in width for such facilities shall be provided across property
outside the public way lines and with satisfactory access to public
ways. Easements shall be indicated on the preliminary and final plats.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the public way to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
b. When a new drainage system is to be constructed which will carry
water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate
drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat.
c. The applicant shall dedicate, when required by the planning
commission, either in fee, or by drainage or conservation easement,
the land on both sides of an existing watercourse to a distance to be
determined by the planning commission.
d. Along watercourses, low-lying lands within any floodway, as
determined by the planning commission pursuant to Section 3-103, of
these regulations, whether or not included in areas for dedication,
shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways.
5-105.303 Ditching, Concrete Ditch Paving, and Culverts and Storm
Drains
The design and construction details of drainage facilities shall be in
accordance with the provisions of these regulations. The design and
construction details of all such facilities shall be approved by the appropriate
governmental representative.
53
5-106 Water Facilities
5-106.1 General Requirements
1. Necessary action shall be taken by the developer to extend a water supply
system capable of providing domestic water use and fire protection.
2. Where a public water main is within reasonable access of the subdivision, as
determined by the planning commission, the subdivider shall install adequate
water facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to construction and material
specifications approval of the planning commission, the Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation and these regulations.
3. Water mains shall not be less than six (6) inches in diameter.
4. All water systems, whether public or private, located in a flood prone area
shall be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation. All water
supply facilities located below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall
be designed to prevent the infiltration of floodwaters into the water supply
system and discharges from the system into floodwaters.
5-106.2 Fire Hydrants
Fire hydrants of three-way type shall be required in all subdivisions where the
system will provide adequate fire flow and pressure; they shall be located no more
than one thousand (1,000) feet apart and be within five hundred (500) feet of any
residential, commercial, or industrial lot. In cases where the system does not
provide adequate fire flow and pressure, fill stations of the two way variety shall be
placed at the beginning and the end of the line. However, the planning commission
may require closer spacing where physical conditions or types of structures so
warrant. To eliminate future public way cutting or openings, all underground utilities
for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other water
supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a public way
shown on the subdivision plat, unless otherwise approved by the planning
commission.
5-106.3 Future Extensions
Water lines which end at temporary cul-de-sacs, and which are to be extendedat a
later date, shall have a six-inch (or larger) value installed; and a blow-off line
extended to the suface with the end of the line terminating in a meter box.
5-107 Sewage Facilities
5-107.1 General Requirements
The applicant shall install sanitary sewer facilities in a manner prescribed by the
regulations of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and by
any other applicable standards and specifications. All plans shall be designed and
approved in accordance with the rules, regulations, specifications, and standards,
of any applicable governmental agency or appropriate unit thereof.
54
5-107.2 Mandatory Connection to Public Sewer System
1. When public sanitary sewers are within reasonable access of the
subdivision, as determined by the planning commission, the subdivider shall
provide sanitary sewer facilities to each lot therein and shall connect the
facilities to the public system. The subdivider shall provide sewers which
meet standards set forth in the regulations of the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation.
2. All sanitary sewer facilities located in a flood hazard area shall be
floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation. All sewer facilities
located below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be designed to
prevent infiltration of floodwaters into the sewer system and discharges from
the system into floodwaters.
5-107.3 Individual Disposal System Requirements
If public sewer facilities are not available and individual disposal systems are
proposed, lot areas shall not be less than the minimums specified in these
regulations; all pertinent soil absorption tests shall be made as directed by the
county environmentalist and the results submitted to the county health department for
approval.
The individual disposal system, including the size of the septic tank and size of the
tile fields or other secondary treatment device, also shall be approved by the county
health department.
The planning commission may prohibit installation of sewage disposal facilities
requiring soil absorption systems where such systems will not function due to high
groundwater, flooding, or unsuitable soil characteristics. The planning commission
may require that the subdivider note on the face of the plat and any deed of
conveyance that soil absorption fields are prohibited in designated areas.
5-107.4 Design Criteria for Sanitary Sewers
Sanitary sewer systems shall be designed for the ultimate tributary population
based upon appropriate plans and zoning regulations.
The minimum size of a public sewer line shall be eight (8) inches in diameter with
individual lot service lines a minimum of four (4) inches.
Sanitary sewers shall be located within a public street right-of-way, unless
topography dictates otherwise. Public utility easements shall be provided across
private property for access to lines and manholes such easements to be of an
adequate width for service purposes, but in no case less than twenty (20) feet.
5-108 Utility Easements
A. Easements down rear lot lines or additionally across lots, if deemed necessary by
the planning commission, shall be provided for utilities (private or public).
55
Such easements shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide. The subdivider shall take
such actions as are necessary to ensure the coordination and continuation of utility
easements established on adjacent properties with those proposed within his
development.
B. Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical the
inclusion of utilities within rear lot lines, perpetual unobstructed easements at least
twenty (20) feet in width shall be provided along side lot lines with satisfactory
access to public ways or rear lot lines. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
C. Temporary construction easements exceeding the width of permanent easements
may be required as necessary until completion of any one project.
5-109 Public Uses
5-109.1 Plat to Provide for Public Uses
Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes a school, recreation use, a portion of a
major public way, or other public use, as indicated on the land development plan
and/or major street or road plan, or any portion thereof, such tract shall be suitably
incorporated by the developer into his plat when first presented for review by the
planning commission.
After proper determination of its necessity by the planning commission and the
appropriate governmental representative(s) involved in the acquisition and use of
such site, and after a determination has been made to acquire the site by the public
agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated by the developer into the plat prior to
final approval by the planning commission and recording of the plat.
5-109.2 Referral to the Governmental Agency Concerned
The planning commission shall refer any plat presented in accordance with
Subsection 5-109.1, to the governmental agency concerned with acquisition of the
land. The planning commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition
and shall allow the appropriate governmental agency thirty (30) days for reply.
Among the areas which the planning commission may propose for public
acquisition, when the commission deems it appropriate and consistent with the
policies and purposes set forth in these regulations, is any land within a floodway or
floodway fringe determined according to the procedure outlined herein.
The acquiring agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing
the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time
required to complete the acquisition.
5-109.3 Notice to Property Owner
Upon receipt of an affirmative report, the planning commission shall notify the
property owner and shall designate on all plats any areas proposed to be
56
acquired by any governmental agency. Upon such designation by the planning
commission, any reserved portion of any floodway or floodway fringe shall not be

upon written approval of the planning commission.
5-109.4 Duration of Land Reservation
The acquisition of land reserved by a governmental agency on the final plat shall be
initiated within twenty-four (24) months of notification, in writing, from the owner that
he intends to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a plat
of a proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the
part of the governmental agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed twenty
four (24) months shall result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the
property involved and the freeing of the property for development in accordance with
these regulations.
5-110 Preservation of Natural Features and Amenities
Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the area as a
whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable
assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision, as required by the planning
commission. No change of grade of the land shall be affected nor shall any natural features
be removed or relocated until a preliminary subdivision plat has been approved by the

purpose, the layout of the subdivision with respect to such land shall make such
provisions as the planning commission may require. A nonresidential subdivision
also shall be subject to all the requirements of site plan approval set forth in any
zoning ordinance. Site plan approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion
of the planning commission. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the
requirements of these regulations, as well as such additional standards set forth by
the planning commission, and shall conform to the proposed land development plan,
major street or road plan, and any zoning ordinance.
5-111.2 Standards
In addition to the principles and standards in the regulations, which are appropriate
to the planning of all subdivisions, the subdivider shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the planning commission that the public way, parcel, and block
pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into
account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be
observed:
1. proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in areas and dimensions to the
types of nonresidential development anticipated;
57
2. public way rights-of-way and pavements shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated;

appearance.
C. BASE AND PAVING
1. Base Course
The base course of stone shall be placed and compacted in layers or lifts
upon the prepared subgrade to a finish thickness as described and shown
on the plans. No single layer or lift shall exceed four (4) inches in depth.
The base course shall be a pugmill mix of mineral aggregate conforming to
the technical specifications set forth in Section 303, Standard Specifications.
The aggregate base shall not be spread on a subgrade that is frozen or that
contains frost. The base shall be placed and spread in uniform layers or lifts
without segregation of size; each layer shall be compacted to a thickness no
greater than four (4) inches. The stone shall be mixed with graders or other
equipment until a uniform mixture is obtained. Each layer shall be
compacted by rolling with alternate blading until a smooth, even, and
uniformly compacted finish is obtained.
The base course shall be graded and rolled while it is still moist from the
pugmill mixer. If the enforcing officer determines that the mix is too dry, water
shall be added with a distributor tank truck while the stone is being graded
and rolled. Compaction shall be uniform for the entire width of the roadway
until a density of eighty (80) percent of the solid volume has been achieved.
Placement and compaction of each layer shall be approved by the enforcing
officer before materials for the next successive layer are placed.
95
Base course density tests shall be conducted by a testing laboratory,
licensed by the State of Tennessee, and shall be furnished at the expense of
the subdivider and submitted directly to the Enforcing Officer, from the testing
laboratory. A minimum of one base course density test for every two
hundred-fifty (250) feet of roadway will be required.
No pavement shall be placed until the stone base has been approved by the
enforcing officer.
2. Prime Coat
After the base stone has been prepared as outlined above, a bituminous
prime coat shall be applied uniformly over the surface of the base by the use
of an approved bituminous distributor. The prime coat shall be applied at the
rate of the three-tenths (3/10) gallon per square yard, using Grade RC-70 or
RC-250, or refined tar Grade RT-2, RT-3, or emulsified asphalt, Grade AE-P.
If, after the bituminous materials have been applied, they fail to penetrate
before the time that the roadway is to be used by traffic, dry cover materials
shall be spread at a rate established by the enforcing officer, (between eight
(8) and twelve (12) pounds per square yard) to prevent damage to the
primed surface. An excess of cover materials shall be avoided. No
succeeding stage of construction shall be placed upon the prime coat until it
has properly cured. Aggregate for cover materials shall be Size No. 78 or 8.
In addition to these general requirements, unless otherwise stipulated, all
materials and methods of installation shall conform to the technical
specifications set forth in Section 402, Standard Specifications.
