other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of
the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all

ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under
this section governing the consent of the grantor to such change in
control of ownership shall apply.
E. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change,
transfer or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party and the

the legal, technical and financial qualifications to operate and maintain
the system and comply with all franchise requirements for the

financial, character and technical qualities of the applicant and
determining that they are satisfactory, the Borough finds that such

will insure continued service and compliance with all franchise
requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control
over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over

Borough in its discretion and during said period of time it shall have the

to secure all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such
subscriber within such thirty-day period on reasonable terms and
conditions where economically feasible. Economic feasibility shall be
defined as installation costs within 150% of the average cost of service
installation, as demonstrated by the cable operator.

grantor may, in its sole discretion, limit the number of franchises
granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of

The grantee shall not disseminate information as to the names, addresses or
telephone numbers of subscribers or any subscriber information furnished

for the previous calendar year. Upon 10 days' prior written notice, the
grantor shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of the

principles and if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of
5% or more, the grantee shall assume all reasonable costs of such an
audit.
C. Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by
the Borough shall be construed as a release or an accord and
satisfaction of any claim the Borough may have for further or additional
sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or any franchise
agreement or for the performance of any other obligation of the
grantee.

operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities therein
underground.
C. In those areas of the Borough where the grantee's cables are located on
the aboveground transmission or distribution facilities of the public
utility providing telephone or electric power service and in the event
that the facilities of both such public utilities subsequently are placed
§ 99-17 GREENCASTLE CODE § 99-19
99:66
underground, then the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and
maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at the
grantee's cost. Certain of the grantee's equipment, such as pedestals,
amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above
ground, may continue to remain in aboveground closures.
D. In new residential developments in which all the electric power and
telephone utilities are underground, the following procedure shall
apply with respect to access to and utilization of underground
easements:
(1) The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all
franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire (or,
pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter and any
franchise agreement, may be required) to provide cable service to
that development. The developer may establish a reasonable
deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final
development map shall indicate the cable operators that have
agreed to serve the development.
(2) If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall be
accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory
shared basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the
developer shall provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable
television cables and dedicate to the Borough any initially
unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled to recover the
cost of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event that the
grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any
grantee.
(3) The developer shall provide at least 10 working days' notice of the
date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that
have agreed to serve the development. When the trenches are
open, cable operators shall have two working days to begin the
installation of their cables and five working days after beginning
installation to complete installation.
(4) The final development map shall not be approved until the
developer submits evidence that:
(a) It has notified each grantee that underground utility trenches
are to open as of an estimated date, and that the grantee will
be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from
proposed streets to individual homes or home sites, on
specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions.
(b) It has received a written notification from each grantee that
the grantee intends to install its facilities during the open
trench period on the specified terms and conditions, or such
other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the
developer and the grantee, or has received no reply from a
grantee within 10 days after its notification to such grantee, in
§ 99-19 CABLE TELEVISION § 99-19
99:67
§ 99-20. Technical standards.
which case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its
opportunity to install its facilities during the open trench
period.
(5) Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance with
state regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is
not possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the
cable television cables, with the entire cost shared among the
participating cable operators. With the concurrence of the
developer, the affected utilities and the cable operators, alternative
installation procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be
utilized, subject to applicable law.
E. Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have
been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and associated
costs and shall repair all property to the condition which existed prior
to such trenching.
F. In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the Borough
reserves the right to limit the number of drop cables and/or pedestals
per residence, or to require that the drop cable(s) and/or pedestal(s) be
utilized only by the cable operator selected by the resident to provide
service.
A. The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in
a manner consistent with all applicable laws, ordinances, construction
standards, governmental requirements, Federal Communications
Commission technical standards and any standards set forth in its
franchise agreement. In addition, the grantee shall provide to the
Borough, upon request, a written report of the results of the grantee's
periodic proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to Federal
Communications Commission standards and guidelines.
B. Repeated and verified failure to maintain specified technical standards
shall constitute a material franchise violation.

sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as
amended, as well as all other applicable local, state and federal laws
and regulations.
D. All installation of electronic equipment shall be in accordance with the
provisions of the National Electrical and Safety Code and National
Electrical Code, as amended, and as may from time to time be
amended.

lighted, erected and maintained in accordance with all applicable rules
and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration and all other
applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations.

The grantee shall have the authority to trim trees, in accordance with all
applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement restrictions, upon
and hanging over streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the Borough
so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with
the wires and cables of the grantee. Borough representatives shall have
authority to supervise and approve all trimming of trees conducted by the
grantee. No trimming shall be done without first obtaining an annual permit
from the Borough of Greencastle Shade Tree Commission, except minor

upon the poles and within the underground pipes and conduits of the
grantee, any wires and fixtures desired by the Borough for the use of the
Borough and any other public institutions or not-for-profit entities in the
Borough, other than for a competitive cable system, to the extent that
such installation and maintenance does not interfere with operations of the
grantee.
§ 99-23. Use of channels.
Cablecasting shall be offered pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended. Programming decisions will be at the sole discretion of the
grantee; however, all local commercial and public broadcast services, as
directed by the Federal Communications Commission, will be provided, as
well as such governmental and educational access channels agreed to in any
agreement established under this chapter. All notices of channel changes,
program changes and rate changes will be provided to the Borough at least
F. All of the grantee's plant and equipment, including, but not limited to,
the antenna site, headend and distribution system, towers, house
connections, structures, poles, wire, coaxial cable, fixtures and
appurtenances, shall be installed, located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained and operated
in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by
experienced maintenance and construction personnel so as not to
endanger or interfere with improvements the Borough may deem
appropriate to make or to interfere in any manner with the rights of any
property owner, or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or
vehicular traffic.

grantee shall permit examination by any duly authorized representative
of the Borough, of all franchise property and facilities, together with
any appurtenant property and facilities of the grantee situated within or
without the Borough, and all records relating to the franchise;
provided, they are necessary to enable the Borough to carry out its
regulatory responsibilities under local, state and federal law, this
chapter and the franchise agreement. Such records include all books,
records, maps, plans, financial statements, service complaint logs,
performance test results, records of request for service and other like

from the Borough and an opportunity to cure such nonperformance, the
grantor may act to remedy such violation in accordance with the following
procedures:
§ 99-29. Force majeure; grantee's inability to perform.
In the event the grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions
or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder
is prevented by a cause or event not within the grantee's control, such
inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions
shall be imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes
or events not within the control of the grantee shall include, without
the Law Department and Council members. To the extent any

required by the Borough, shall submit to the grantor an instrument,
satisfactory in form to the Borough, transferring to the Borough the

aboveground portions of the cable television system from all streets and
public ways within the Borough within a reasonable period of time,
which shall not be less than 180 days.

and terminate 120 days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or
trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of the
grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other
action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have
been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:

election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and
provisions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant
hereto, and the receivership or trustees within said 120 days shall
have remedied all the faults under the franchise or provided a plan
for the remedy of such faults which is satisfactory to the Borough;
and
(2) Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the
premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to
be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the
franchise granted.
B. In case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the franchise property,
or any material part thereof, the grantor may serve notice of
termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in
which the event the franchise granted and all rights and privileges of
the grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after service
of such notice, unless:
(1) The grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as
and in the manner that this chapter provides; and
(2) Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the
grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the

franchise.
B. The Borough shall have the right to waive any provision of the
franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the

the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the
grantee or the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be
evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized
representative of the Borough. Waiver of any provision in one instance
shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such
instance nor be deemed a waiver of nay other provision of the franchise
unless the statement so recites.
A. The grantee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, channel users or general citizens on

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 122-17. Identification.
§ 122-18. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
§ 122-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
of the Borough of Greencastle where studies or information provided by a
qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after
the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify the
FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Borough of
Greencastle, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated January 18, 2012, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision
thereof. Including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study.
B. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Borough of Greencastle
incorporated herein by reference, and declared to be a part of this
chapter.
A. For the purposes of this chapter, the one-hundred-year flood elevation,
identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by
FEMA, shall be used as the basis for regulation. When available,
information from other Federal, State, and other acceptable sources
shall be used to determine the one-hundred-year elevation, as well as a
floodway area, if possible. When no other information is available, the
one-hundred-year elevation shall be determined by using a point on the
boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site in question.
B. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only
by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.

The Borough may require a significant industrial user to provide and
operate, at the significant industrial user's own expense, monitoring
facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the
discharge from the significant industrial user. The monitoring facility should
normally be situated on the significant industrial user's premises, but the
Borough may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the significant industrial user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
§ 155-29. Construction and maintenance.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities
shall be provided in accordance with the Borough's requirements and all
applicable local construction standards and specifications. There shall be
ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling
and preparation of samples for transport. Construction shall be completed
within 90 days after construction plans have been approved by the Borough,
in accordance with Article VI, § 155-30, of this chapter. The monitoring
facility shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the significant industrial user.
§ 155-30. Detailed plans.
Detailed plans showing the intended facilities shall be submitted to the
Borough for review within the time period approved by the Borough, and

acceptable for construction.
§ 155-31. Inspection and sampling.
The Borough may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of any Borough ordinance is being met and all requirements are
being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater
is created or where there is a wastewater discharge shall allow the Borough
or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of
the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination
or in the performance of any of their duties. The Borough shall have
the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary
to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where a user has a security measure in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises,
the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that
upon presentation of suitable identification, the Borough will be permitted
§ 155-28 REAL ESTATE REGISTRY § 155-31

Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Borough for review, and shall be
approved by the Borough before construction of the facility and
implementation of the proposed procedures. All existing industrial users
shall complete a plan, or provide evidence that such a plan is not necessary
for their facility. No industrial user who commences discharge to the sewer
system after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to
discharge into the sewer system until this requirement has been fulfilled.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the industrial
user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
§ 155-34. Notification of discharge.
In the case of an accidental discharge or slug load, it is the responsibility
of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the Borough of
the incident. The notification by the industrial user shall include location of
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions
to mitigate the accidental discharge or slug load.
§ 155-35. Written notice.
Within five days following an accidental discharge or slug load, the
industrial user shall submit to the Borough a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewer system,
fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
§ 155-36. Notice to employees.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an
accidental discharge or slug load. Employers shall insure that all employees
who may cause or suffer such an accidental discharge or slug load to occur
are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

pretreatment of wastewater to a level acceptable to the Borough shall
be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Borough for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Borough before construction of the facility. The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the industrial
user from the responsibility of modifying under the provisions of all Borough
ordinances. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Borough
prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes. All records relating to
compliance with all Borough ordinances shall be made available to officials
of the Borough upon request.
§ 155-38. Availability of information.
Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and
from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the
industrial user. The portions of a report which would disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public
but shall nevertheless be made available upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to all Borough ordinances, the
NPDES permit, any state disposal system permit and/or the programs under
applicable categorical standards or for use by the Borough, any state,
the Untied States, or any state or federal agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the user or the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized
as confidential information.
§ 155-39. Industrial user notification.

§ 155-40. Methods of measuring volume.
A. Whenever a person purchasing all water used from the Water Authority
discharges sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewer
system, the volume of water used, as determined from meter readings
of the Borough, shall be used in computing the sewer rental.
B. In cases where persons have sources of water supply in addition to or
other than from the Water Authority and discharge sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes into the sewer system, those persons shall
provide a meter on such additional or other source of supply. The total
amount of water consumed as shown by these meter readings will be
used in computing the sewer rental.
C. In cases where persons use water from the Water Authority and/or from
an independent supply such that all or any part of the water so used is
not discharged into the sewer system, the quantity of water used to
determine the sewer rental shall be computed by one of the following
methods:
(1) By placing a meter or measuring device on the sewer connection.
The readings from this meter or measuring device shall be used in
computing the sewer rental.
(2) By placing a meter or measuring device on the effluent not
discharging into the sewer system. The readings from this meter or
measuring device will then be deducted from the total water meter
readings and the remainder will be used in computing the sewer
rental.
(3) When, in the opinion of the sewer manager, it is not practical to
install measuring devices to continuously determine the quantity of
water not discharged to the sewer system, the sewer manager will
determine, in such manner and by such method as he may
prescribe, the percentage of metered water discharged into the
sewer system and the quantity of water used to compute the sewer
rental shall be the percentage so determined of the quantity
measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to the
estimated amount shall be submitted to the Council after notice of
the estimate, whose decision on the matter shall be final for the
current calendar year.
D. In cases where the Borough provides sanitary sewage services to a
person or persons, user or users, and corporation or corporations,
hereinafter generally referred to as "user," by accepting sanitary
sewage from a main or pipe which is the terminus or end of a sanitary
sewer collection system of such user, the user shall install a meter or
measuring device for the purpose of measuring the quantity of sanitary

Borough, and may be tested, inspected or repaired by Borough employees
whenever Council deems necessary. The owner of the property upon which
such measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its maintenance
and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at the property
owner's expense, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary
wear and tear or other causes. Bills for such repairs, if made by the
Borough, shall be due and payable at the same time and collected in the
same manner as are the bills for sewer services; such bills from and after
their due date shall constitute a lien upon the property upon which such
measuring device is installed.
§ 155-42. Meter readings.
Borough shall be responsible for the reading of all meters or measuring
devices, and they shall be made available to Borough employees for meter
reading at any reasonable time.

not to restore the same until all delinquent bills against the same and
the cost of cutting off and restoring service shall have been paid.
B. All persons connected to the sewer system must give the Borough their
correct address. Failure to receive bills will not be considered an excuse
for nonpayment nor permit an extension of the period during which bills
are payable at face.
C. All sewer rentals, together with all penalties thereon, not paid on or
before the end of one year from the date of each bill shall be deemed to
be delinquent. All delinquent sewer rentals and all penalties thereon

for, and any fines collected by the Borough in connection with the sewer
system shall be segregated and kept separate and apart from all other funds
of the Borough and shall be used only for the purpose of defraying the
expenses of the Borough in the operation, maintenance, repair, alteration,
inspection, depreciation or other expenses in relation to such sewer system

or agreement it may enter into for and of, or in connection with, said sewer
system, with the Authority, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of
May 2, 1945, P.L. 382, as amended.
§ 155-46. Service during portion of quarter.
Whenever sewer service to any property begins after the first day or
terminates before the last day of any calendar quarter, the sewer rentals for
such period shall be a pro rata amount for that portion of the period during
which said property is served; provided, however, that in making any such
apportionment a fraction of a calendar month, amounting to 1/2 or more of
a calendar month, shall be counted a full month, and a fraction of a calendar
month amounting to less than 1/2 of a calendar month shall be disregarded.
§ 155-47. Rules and regulations.
The Borough reserves the right to, and may from time to time, adopt, revise,
amend and readopt such rules and regulations, by resolution, as it deems
necessary and proper for the use and operation of the sewer system, and all
such rules and regulations shall be and become a part of and enforceable

suit at law against the user who is found to have violated this chapter.
A. The Borough may suspend services provided by the sewage treatment
plant when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Borough,
in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, causes interference to the
sewer system, or causes the Borough to violate any condition of its
NPDES permit.
B. Any user notified of a suspension of the services provided by the sewage
treatment plant shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In
the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Borough shall take such steps, as it may deem
necessary, including, without limitation, immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system
or endangerment to any individuals.
C. The Borough shall reinstate the service provided by the sewage
treatment plant upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying
discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the IU describing
the cause of the noncomplying discharge and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Borough within
15 days of the date of the occurrence.

General Provisions
§ 166-1. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 166-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Conococheague Creek Watershed by minimizing the damages described
in § 166-1A of this chapter through provisions designed to:
§ 166-3. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32
P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended, the "Stormwater Management Act," and
the applicable municipal code.
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of
the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
A. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
B. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
C. Encourage recharge of groundwater where appropriate and prevent
degradation of groundwater quality.
D. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the
watershed.
E. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
F. Provide proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management
facilities that are constructed in the watershed.
G. Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershed-wide
stormwater management and planning.

§ 166-4. Applicability.
§ 166-5. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued pursuant to this chapter do not relieve the applicant of
the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance.
A. This chapter shall apply to those areas of the municipality that are
located within the Conococheague Creek Watershed, as delineated in
Appendix D, which is hereby adopted as part of this chapter.29
B. This chapter shall only apply to permanent stormwater management
facilities constructed as part of any of the regulated activities listed in
this section. Stormwater management and erosion and sedimentation
control during construction activities are specifically not regulated by
this chapter, but shall continue to be regulated under existing laws and
ordinances.
C. This chapter contains only the stormwater management performance
standards and design criteria that are necessary or desirable from a
watershed-wide perspective. Local stormwater management design
criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection system design and
details, outlet structure design, etc.) shall continue to be regulated by
the applicable municipal ordinances.
D. The following activities are defined as "regulated activities" and shall
be regulated by this chapter:
(1) Land development.
(2) Subdivision.
(3) Construction of new or additional impervious or semipervious
surfaces (driveways, parking lots, etc.).
(4) Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
(5) Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
(6) Installation of stormwater management facilities or appurtenances
thereto.

ARTICLE III
Stormwater Management Requirements
§ 166-8. General requirements.
A. All regulated activities in Conococheague Creek Watershed which do
not fall under the exemption criteria shown in § 166-18 shall submit a
drainage plan consistent with the Conococheague Creek Watershed
Stormwater Management Plan to the municipality for review. This
criteria shall apply to the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages. Impervious cover shall include,
but not be limited to, any roof, parking or driveway areas and any new
streets and sidewalks. Any areas designed to initially be gravel or
crushed stone shall be assumed to be impervious for the purposes of
comparison to the exemption criteria.
B. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
chapter.
C. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the
affected property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
D. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. If
diffused drainage discharge is proposed to be concentrated and
discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must document that
adequate downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
E. Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also,
maintenance, including mowing of vegetation within the easement,
shall be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.
F. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PaDEP through the joint permit

§ 166-9. Stormwater management districts established.
application process, or, where deemed appropriate by PaDEP, through
the general permit process.
G. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the Commonwealth or
wetlands shall be subject to approval by PaDEP through the joint permit
application process, or, where deemed appropriate by PaDEP, the
general permit process. When there is a question whether wetlands
may be involved, it is the responsibility of the developer or his agent to
show that the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands,
otherwise approval to work in the area must be obtained from PaDEP.
H. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located on state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to
approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
I. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged strongly,
where soil conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need
for detention facilities.
J. Roof drains must not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers
or roadside ditches to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where advantageous to do so. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
it shall be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the municipality.
K. Special requirements for watersheds draining to high quality (HQ) and
exceptional value (EV) waters. The temperature and quality of water
and streams that have been declared as exceptional value and high
quality are to be maintained as defined in Chapter 93, Water Quality
Standards, Title 25 of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Rules and Regulations. Temperature-sensitive BMPs and
stormwater conveyance systems are to be used and designed with
storage pool areas and supply outflow channels and should be shaded
with trees. This will require modification of berms for permanent ponds
and the relaxation of restrictions on planting vegetation within the
facilities, provided that capacity for volumes and rate control is
maintained. At a minimum, the southern half on pond shorelines shall
be planted with shade or canopy trees within 10 feet of the pond
shoreline. In conjunction with this requirement, the maximum slope
allowed on the berm area to be planted is 10 to one. A long-term
maintenance schedule and management plan for the thermal control
BMPs is to be established and recorded for all development sites.
A. Conococheague Creek Watershed has been divided into stormwater
management districts as shown on the Watershed Map in Appendix D.30

standards).
B. In addition to the requirements specified below, the groundwater
recharge (§ 166-14), water quality (§ 166-15), and streambank erosion
(§ 166-16) requirements shall be implemented.
C. Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the
Conococheague Creek Watershed are shown below. Development sites
located in each of the A, B, or C Districts must control postdevelopment
runoff rates to predevelopment runoff rates for the design storms as
follows:

C (See below) (See below)
Explanation of District C, Provisional Direct Discharge District.
Development sites which can discharge directly to the Conococheague
Creek main channel or major tributaries or indirectly to the main
channel through an existing stormwater drainage system (i.e., storm
sewer or tributary) may do so without control of postdevelopment peak
rate of runoff. Sites in District C will still have to comply with the
criteria for groundwater recharge (§ 166-14); water quality (§ 166-15);
and streambank erosion (§ 166-16). If the postdevelopment runoff is
intended to be conveyed by an existing stormwater drainage system
to the main channel, assurance must be provided that such system
has adequate capacity to convey the increased peak flows or will be
provided with improvements to furnish the required capacity. When
adequate capacity of downstream system does not exist and will not
be provided through improvements, the postdevelopment peak rate of
runoff must be controlled to the predevelopment peak rate as required
in District A provisions (i.e., ten-year postdevelopment flows to 10
predevelopment flows) for the specified design storms.
30.Editor's Note: Appendixes A through D are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 166-9 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 166-10
162:197
A. General. Postdevelopment peak rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall meet the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified on the Stormwater Management District
Watershed Map (Appendix D31) and § 166-9 of this chapter.
B. District boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on an official map that is available for inspections at
the municipal office. A copy of the official map at a reduced scale is
included in Appendix D. The exact location of the stormwater
management district boundaries as they apply to a given development
site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot
topographic contours (or most accurate data required) provided as part
of the drainage plan.
C. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
located within two or more stormwater management district category
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the
predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea as indicated in
§ 166-9. The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of
whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea. An
exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple
subareas recombine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the
overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
D. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development
site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable
peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed
to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
E. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures
shall be subject to the management district criteria. In other words,
unimpacted areas bypassing the stormwater management facilities
would not be subject to the management district criteria.
F. "No harm" option. For any proposed development site not located in a
provisional direct discharge district, the developer has the option of
using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the
developer can prove that "no harm" would be caused by discharging at
a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan. The "no harm"
option is used when a developer can prove that the postdevelopment
hydrographs can match predevelopment hydrographs, or if it can be
proved that the postdevelopment conditions will not cause increases in
peaks at all points downstream. Proof of "no harm" would have to be
shown based upon the following "downstream impact evaluation" which
shall include a "downstream hydraulic capacity analysis" consistent
with Subsection G to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity exists.
31.Editor's Note: Appendixes A through D are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 166-10 GREENCASTLE CODE § 166-10
162:198
The land developer shall submit to the municipality this evaluation
of the impacts due to increased downstream stormwater flows in the
watershed.
(1) The "downstream impact evaluation" shall include hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the impact of
hydrograph timing modifications due to the proposed development
upon a dam, highway, structure, natural point of restricted
streamflow or any stream channel section, established with the
concurrence of the municipality.
(2) The evaluation shall continue downstream until the increase in flow
diminishes due to additional flow from tributaries and/or stream
attenuation.
(3) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-,
and one-hundred-year) shall be the values from the calibrated
model for the Conococheague Creek Watershed. These flow values
can be obtained from the watershed plan.
(4) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would,
by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to prove "noharm,"
except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements
for the problem areas consistent with Subsection H.
(5) A financial distress shall not constitute grounds for granting a noharm
exemption.
(6) Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to
implement the "no harm" option which proposes specific capacity
improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control
would not create any harm downstream.
(7) Any "no harm" justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Article IV.
G. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use
the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased
peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon
criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual.
§ 166-10 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 166-10
162:199
§ 166-11. Design criteria for stormwater management facilities.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without creating
any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
H. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-by-case basis
using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection
of the downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic model" refers to the
calibrated model as developed for the stormwater management plan.
I. "Hardship option." The development of the plan and its standards and
criteria was designed to maintain existing peak flows throughout the
Conococheague Creek Watershed as the watershed becomes
developed. There may be certain instances, however, where the
standards and criteria established are too restrictive for a particular
landowner or developer. The existing drainage network in some areas
may be capable of safely transporting slight increases in flows without
causing a problem or increasing flows elsewhere. If a developer or
homeowner may not be able to possibly meet the stormwater standards
due to lot conditions or if conformance would become a hardship to an
owner, the hardship option may be applied. The landowner would have
to plead his/her case to the Borough Council with the final
determination made by the Borough. Any landowners pleading the
"hardship option" will assume all liabilities that may arise due to
exercising this option.
A. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
B. Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin) designed to
store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or
regulated by this chapter shall be designed to provide an emergency
spillway to handle flow up to and including the one-hundred-year
postdevelopment conditions. The height of embankment must be set as
to provide a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard above the maximum pool
elevation computed when the facility functions for the one-hundred-

Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or a soil-cover-complex methodology.
year postdevelopment inflow. Should any stormwater management
facility require a dam safety permit under PaDEP Chapter 105, the
facility shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 105 and meet
the regulations of Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may be
required to pass storms larger than the one-hundred-year event.
C. Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges,
outfalls, or stream enclosures), and any work involving wetlands as
directed in PaDEP Chapter 105 regulations (as amended or replaced
from time to time by PaDEP), shall be designed in accordance with
Chapter 105 and will require a permit from PaDEP. Any other drainage
conveyance facility that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations
must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway, runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm with a minimum
1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of
the roadway. Roadway crossings located within designated floodplain
areas must be able to convey runoff from a one-hundred-year design
storm with a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest
point along the top of roadway. Any facility that constitutes a dam as
defined in PaDEP Chapter 105 regulations may require a permit under
dam safety regulations. Any facility located within a PennDOT right-ofway
must meet PennDOT minimum design standards and permit
submission requirements.
D. Any drainage conveyance facility and/or channel that does not fall
under Chapter 105 Regulations must be able to convey, without damage
to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the ten-year design
storm. Conveyance facilities to or exiting from stormwater management
facilities (i.e., detention basins) shall be designed to convey the design
flow to or from that structure. Roadway crossings located within
designated floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff from a onehundred-
year design storm. Any facility located within a PennDOT
right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum design standards and
permit submission requirements.
E. Storm sewers must be able to convey postdevelopment runoff from a
ten-year design storm without surcharging inlets, where appropriate.
F. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels,
and at all points of discharge.
G. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
sound engineering principles and practices. The municipality shall
reserve the right to disapprove any design that would result in the
occupancy or continuation of an adverse hydrologic or hydraulic
condition within the watershed.
§ 166-11 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 166-12
162:201
A. Any stormwater runoff calculations shall use generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil-cover-complex
method. Table 1 summarizes acceptable computation methods.32 It is
assumed that all methods will be selected by the design professional
based on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a
particular site. The municipality may allow the use of the Rational
Method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain
less than 200 acres. The soil-cover-complex method is recommended
for drainage areas greater than 200 acres.
B. All calculations consistent with this chapter using the soil-covercomplex
method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return period storms according to the region for which they are
located as presented in Table B-1 in Appendix B of this chapter.33 If a
hydrologic computer model such as HEC-HMS, or HEC-1 is used for
stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24
hours. The alternating block method to develop design hyetographs
described in Figure B-1, Appendix B, of this chapter shall be used for
the rainfall distribution.
C. For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination,
undeveloped land shall be considered as "meadow" in good condition,
unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve number or
Rational "C" value (i.e., forest), as listed in Table B-2 or B-3 in Appendix
B of this chapter.
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration for overland flow
and return periods from the Design Storm Curves from Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Design Rainfall Curves (1986) (Figures
B-3 to B-4). Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated
using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to

§ 166-14. Groundwater recharge (infiltration; recharge; retention).
A. Whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such
activity must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title 25, Rules and
Regulations, Part I, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Environmental Protection, Subpart C, Protection of Natural Resources,
Article II, Water Resources, Chapter 102, "Erosion Control," and in
accordance with the Franklin County Conservation District.
B. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be or are recommended to be applied where
infiltration BMPs are proposed shall include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
received final stabilization.
A. The ability to retain and maximize the groundwater recharge capacity
of the area being developed is encouraged strongly. Design of the
infiltration/recharge stormwater management facilities shall give
consideration to providing groundwater recharge to compensate for the
reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is
paved and roofed over. These measures are encouraged, particularly in
hydrologic soil groups A and B and should be utilized wherever feasible.
Soils used for the construction of basins shall have low-erodibility
factors ("K" factors).
B. Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(1) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas
shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site conditions
and shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
(a) A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the
facility and the seasonal high water table and/or bedrock
(limiting zones).
(b) An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to accept the
additional stormwater load and drain completely as
determined by field tests conducted by the owner's
professional designer or as otherwise approved by the
Municipal Engineer.
(2) Infiltration BMPs receiving only roof runoff may be placed in soils
having a minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the
facility and the limiting zone.
§ 166-13 GREENCASTLE CODE § 166-14
162:204
(3) The size of the recharge facility shall be based upon the following
equation (DEP):
Rev = [(S) (Rv) (A)]/12
Where:
Rev = Recharge volume (acre-feet)
S = Soil specific recharge factor (inches)
Rv = Volumetric runoff coefficient
A = Site area contributing to the recharge facility (acres)
And:
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009 (I)
Where:
I = percent impervious area
And:
S may be obtained based upon hydrologic soil group based
upon the table below recommended as general values by
DEP. More site specific data may be utilized to determine
recharge if justified by the design engineer and approved by
the Municipal Engineer.
Hydrologic Soil Group Soil Specific Recharge Factor (S)
A 0.38 inches
B 0.25 inches
C 0.13 inches
D 0.06 inches
If more than one hydrologic soil group (HSG) is present at a site,
a composite recharge volume shall be computed based upon the
proportion of total site area within each HSG.
(4) The recharge volume provided at the site shall be directed to the
most permeable HSG available, if feasible.
(5) The recharge facility shall be capable of completely infiltrating the
recharge volume within four days (96 hours).
(6) Infiltration areas should be located a minimum of 10 feet from a
building foundation.
C. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site may be required to
determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified design professional, and at a minimum,
address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole
formation, and subgrade stability. The general process for designing the
infiltration BMP shall be:
§ 166-14 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 166-14
162:205
§ 166-15. Water quality requirements.
(1) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the watershed to determine general areas of
suitability for infiltration practices.
(2) Provide field test to determine appropriate percolation rate and/or
hydraulic conductivity.
(3) Design infiltration structure for required storm volume based on
field determined capacity at the level of the proposed infiltration
surface.
D. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone areas.
Extreme caution shall also be exercised where salt or chloride would be
a pollutant since soils do little to filter this pollutant and it may
contaminate the groundwater. It is also extremely important that the
qualified design professional evaluate the possibility of groundwater
contamination from the proposed infiltration/recharge facility and
recommend a hydrogeologic justification study be performed if
necessary. Whenever a basin will be located in an area underlain by
limestone, a geological evaluation of the proposed location shall be
conducted to determine susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The
design of all facilities over limestone formations shall include measures
to prevent groundwater contamination and, where necessary, sinkhole
formation. The infiltration requirement in the high quality/exceptional
waters shall be subject to the Department's Chapter 93 and
Antidegradation Regulations. The municipality may require the
installation of an impermeable liner in detention basins. A detailed
hydrogeologic investigation may be required by the municipality. It
shall be the developer's responsibility to verify if the site is underlain by
limestone. The following note shall be attached to all drainage plans
and signed and sealed by the developer's engineer/surveyor/geologist:
"_________________________________________________________, certify that
the proposed detention basin (circle one) is/is not underlain by
limestone."
E. The municipality may require the developer to provide safeguards
against groundwater contamination for uses which may cause
groundwater contamination should there be a mishap or spill.
F. Where pervious pavement is permitted for parking lots, recreational
facilities, nondedicated streets, or other areas, pavement construction
specifications and maintenance schedules shall be noted on the plan.
G. Recharge/infiltration facilities may be used in conjunction with other
innovative or traditional BMPs, stormwater control facilities, and
nonstructural stormwater management alternatives.
§ 166-14 GREENCASTLE CODE § 166-15
162:206
A. In addition to the performance standards and design criteria
requirements of Article III of this chapter, the land developer shall
comply with the following water quality requirements of this article
unless otherwise exempted by provisions of this chapter:
(1) Developed areas will provide adequate storage and treatment
facilities necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. The
recharge volume computed under § 166-14 may be a component of
the water quality volume. If the recharge volume is less than the
water quality volume, the remaining water quality volume may be
captured and treated by methods other than recharge/infiltration
BMPs.
(2) The water quality volume (WQv) is the storage capacity needed to
treat stormwater runoff produced by "P" inch of rainfall (90% rule)
from the developed areas of the site (for "P" Values, see Appendix
B, Table B-534). The following calculation formula is used to
determine the storage volume, WQv, in acre-feet of storage:
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume
P = Rainfall amount [(90% of events producing this
rainfall (Appendix B, Table B-5)]
A = Area in acres
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I) where I is the impervious surface
ratio
B. WQv shall be designed as part of a stormwater management facility
which incorporates water quality BMPs as a primary benefit of using
that facility, in accordance with design specifications contained in
"Pennsylvania Handbook of Best Management Practices for Developing
Areas." The following factors shall be considered when evaluating the
suitability of BMPs used to control water quality at a given development
site:
(1) Total contributing drainage area.
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(3) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(4) Seasonal high water table.
(5) Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
(6) Erodibility of soils.
(7) Land availability and configuration of the topography.

§ 166-16. Stream bank erosion requirements.
Applying the water quality criteria in § 166-15 above will also help the
stream bank erosion problem. Detain the two-year postdevelopment storm
to the one-year predevelopment storm and detaining the one-year
postdevelopment storm a minimum of 24 hours.
C. The following additional factors should be considered when evaluating
the suitability of BMPs used to control water quality at a given
development site:
(1) Peak discharge and required volume control.
(2) Stream bank erosion.
(3) Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality
problems.
(4) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
(5) The nature of the pollutant being removed.
(6) Maintenance requirements.
(7) Creation/protection of aquatic and wildlife habitat.
(8) Recreational value.
(9) Enhancement of aesthetic and property value.

structures or rides. This exclusion shall not apply to newly acquired
acreage by an amusement park until initial plans for the expanded area
have been approved by proper authorities.
A. From the time an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary
or final, is duly filed as provided in this chapter, and while such
application is pending approval or disapproval, no change or
amendment of this chapter, zoning or other governing ordinance or
plan shall affect the decision on such application adversely to the
applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in accordance
with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they stood
at the time the application was duly approved. The applicant shall be
entitled to final approval in accordance with the terms of the approved
preliminary application as hereinafter provided. However, if an
application is properly and finally denied, any subsequent application
shall be subject to the intervening change in governing regulations.
B. When an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or final,
has been approved without conditions or approved by the applicant's
acceptance of conditions, no subsequent change or amendment in this
chapter, zoning or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to
affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence and to complete
any aspect of the approved development in accordance with the terms
of such approval within five years from such approval.
C. Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid
five-year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary
approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary
approval, the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of
this chapter or the governing ordinance or plans as they stood at the
time when the application for such approval was duly filed.

§ 180-18. Amendment procedure.
D. Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plat within the aforesaid fiveyear
limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the Borough
Council, no change of any ordinance or plan enacted subsequent to the
date of filing of the preliminary plat shall modify or revoke any aspect of
the approved final plat pertaining to zoning classification or density, lot,
building, street or utility location.
E. In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by
the landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed
sections as well as deadlines within which applications for final plat
approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be
updated annually by the applicant on or before the anniversary of the
preliminary plat approval, until final plat approval of the final section
has been granted and any modification in the aforesaid schedule shall
be subject to approval of the Borough Council in its discretion.
F. Each section in any residential subdivision or land development, except
for the last section, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the total number
of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser
percentage is approved by the Borough Council in its discretion.
Provided the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any
of the conditions of the preliminary plat approval, including compliance
with landowner's aforesaid schedule of submission of final plats for the
various sections, then the aforesaid protections afforded by
substantially completing the improvements depicted upon the final plat
within five years shall apply and for any section or sections, beyond the
initial section, in which the required improvements have not been
substantially completed within said five-year period the aforesaid
protections shall apply for an additional term or terms of three years
from the date of final plat approval for each section.
G. Failure of landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of submission
of final plats for the various sections shall subject any such section to
any and all changes in this chapter, zoning, and other governing
ordinance enacted by the Borough subsequent to the date of the initial
preliminary plan submission.
A. Amendments to this chapter shall become effective only after a public
hearing held pursuant to public notice. A brief summary setting forth
the principal provisions of the proposed amendment and a reference to
the place within the Borough where copies of the proposed amendment
may be secured or examined shall be incorporated in the public notice.

B. Within 30 days after adoption, the Borough Council shall forward a
certified copy of the amendment to the county planning agency.
C. Proposed amendments shall not be enacted unless notice of proposed
enactment is given in the manner set forth in this section, and shall
include the time and place of the meeting at which passage will be
considered, a reference to a place within the Borough where copies of
the proposed amendment may be examined without charge or obtained
for a charge not greater than the cost thereof. The Borough Council
shall publish the proposed amendment once in a newspaper of general

[Amended 1-3-1995 by Ord. No. 1995-3]
§ 180-23. Plan requirements.
The Planning Commission may require that the following materials shall
be submitted with an application for approval of a final plan. Final plans
shall conform in all important details with preliminary plans as previously
approved, and any conditions specified in the approval of preliminary plans
shall be incorporated in the final plans.
A. Eight copies of the subdivision or land development plan in the form of
a map or series of maps, drawn to a scale of not smaller than 200 feet to
the inch on sheets 8 1/2 by 11 inches, 18 by 24 inches or 24 by 36
inches. Where more than one sheet is required, an index map of the
entire subdivision or land development at a smaller scale shall be
shown on a sheet of the same size. The Planning Commission may
require final plans at a scale of 50 feet to the inch as a condition of
preliminary plan approval to assure legibility in cases warranted by the
complexity of the proposal. At least one copy of such map shall be made
on linen, or acetate, or comparable materials, and the error of closure
shall not be more than one part in 10,000. Such final subdivision plans
shall show:
(1) The items required to be shown in preliminary subdivision plans, as
specified in § 180-21A.

sanitation and other applicable Borough ordinances and regulations
and with the regulations governing the extension of utility services into
the Borough. In any instance where such plans do not conform,
§ 180-23 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 180-23
162:267
§ 180-24. Review procedure.
evidence shall be presented that an exception has been officially
authorized.
F. Evidence that the applicant has installed the necessary streets and
other improvements as required in § 180-29 in accordance with
Borough standards and specifications, or that the applicant has
furnished the Borough with guarantee or surety in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter for the completion of said improvements.
A. One copy of each subdivision plan and one copy of utility maps and
streets profiles received by the Borough Secretary shall be transmitted
to the Borough Planning Commission for its review, or for review by its
subdivision committee. The Commission or its committee shall report
back to the Borough Secretary whether the final plans as submitted are
in sufficient agreement with previously submitted preliminary plans to
warrant detailed engineering in review.
B. On receipt of the Planning Commission's favorable report, the Borough
Secretary shall forward one copy of the subdivision plan and one copy
of utility maps and street profiles to the Engineer for his review as to
the adequacy and estimated cost of construction of required public
improvement. In the event that the Planning Commission finds that the
applicant has made substantial changes in his plans since the
preliminary plans were approved, the Commission shall so notify the
Borough Secretary and shall review the plans according to the
procedure for preliminary plans.
C. On receipt of the Engineer's report, the Borough Secretary shall notify
the Borough Solicitor to prepare proper forms of agreement between
the Borough and the applicant concerning the matters described in
§ 180-23F, above, and in § 180-32U, if appropriate.
D. The Borough Secretary shall not place consideration of the plan on the
agenda of the Borough Council prior to receipt by the Borough of a
favorable report from the Department of Environmental Protection
regarding the official plan revision. However upon receipt of said
favorable report the Borough Secretary shall notify the applicant of the
time and place of the meeting at which the plans shall be considered,
but in no event shall said plans be considered at a meeting later than
provided in Subsection E hereof.
E. All applications for approval of a final plat shall be acted upon by the
Borough Council and its decision communicated to the applicant not
later than 90 days following the date of the regular meeting of the
Borough Council or the Planning Commission (whichever first reviews
the application) next following the date the application is filed, provided
that should the said next regular meeting occur more than 30 days
following the filing of the application, the said ninety-day period shall
§ 180-23 GREENCASTLE CODE § 180-24
162:268
§ 180-25. Completion of improvements or guarantee thereof
prerequisite to approval.
be measured from the 30th day following the day the application has
been filed.
(1) The decision of the Borough Council shall be in writing and shall be
communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him at his
last known address not later than 15 days following the decision.
(2) When the application is not approved in terms as filed the decision
shall specify the defect found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite
to the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.
(3) Failure of the Borough Council to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner
required herein shall be deemed an approval of the application in
terms as presented unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an
extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation of communication of the decision, in which case,
failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of
presentation of communication shall have like effect.
(4) Public hearing. Before acting on any application, the Borough
Council may hold a public hearing thereon after giving public
notice.
A. No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plat
have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this chapter
and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade
trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
improvements as may be required by this chapter have been installed in
accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat,
including improvements or fees otherwise required by this chapter, the
developer may deposit with the Borough financial security in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common amenities
including basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational
facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings
which may be required.
B. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Borough Council shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plat or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial
improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of
contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the
financial security agreement is not executed within 90 days unless a
§ 180-24 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 180-25
162:269
written extension is granted by the Borough Council; such extension
shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the
request of the developer.
C. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Borough may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for
the purposes of this section.
D. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the
party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
Commonwealth.
E. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public,
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
F. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the developer. Annually, the Borough may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements
which have been completed and the estimated cost for the completion
of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date
of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Borough may require
the developer to post additional security in order to assure that the
financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
G. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Borough, upon the recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the Borough are unable to agree upon an estimate, then
the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Borough and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be
paid equally by the Borough and the applicant or developer.
§ 180-25 GREENCASTLE CODE § 180-25
162:270
H. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
I. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Borough Council may authorize submission of final plats by sections or
stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to
improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
J. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough Council to
release or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of
the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing
addressed to the Borough Council, and the Borough Council shall have
45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Borough
Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough Council that such portion
of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance
with the approved plat. Upon such certification the Borough Council
shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of
an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly representing
the value of the improvements completed or, if the Borough Council
fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the Borough Council shall
be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The
Borough Council may, prior to final release at the time of completion
and certification by its Engineer, require retention of 10% of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
K. Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Borough Council may
require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of
said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plat for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as
otherwise required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed
15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
L. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Borough, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
§ 180-25 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 180-25
162:271
§ 180-26. Release from improvement bond.
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this section.
M. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as
set forth in this section, the Borough shall not condition the issuance of
building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement
of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted
upon the final plat upon actual completion of the improvements
depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said financial
security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or
buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the improvement
of the streets providing access to and from existing public roads to such
building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or beyond
the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the
reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
A. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough Council, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough
Engineer. The Borough Council shall, within 10 days after receipt of
such notice, direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect all of
the aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer shall, thereupon,
file a report in writing, with the Borough Council, and shall promptly
mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail.
The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Borough Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Borough
Council; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or
rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said
improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Borough Engineer, said report shall contain a statement
of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
B. The Borough Council shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered
mail of the action of said Borough Council with relation thereto.
C. If the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer fails to comply with the
time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be
deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released
from all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other
security agreement.

complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
E. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Borough Council or the Borough
Engineer.
F. Where herein reference is made to the Borough Engineer, he shall be as
a consultant thereto.
G. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Borough for the
reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection of
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of
the Borough Council and as from time to time amended. Such expense
shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary
fees charged by the Borough Engineer or consultant for work
performed for similar services in the community, but in no event shall
the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the Engineer or consultant
to the Borough when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on
applicants.
(1) In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense
in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant
shall, within 10 working days of the date of billing, notify the
Borough that such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or
unnecessary, in which case the Borough shall not delay or
disapprove a subdivision or land development application or any
approval or permit related to development due to the applicant's
request over disputed Engineer expenses.
(2) If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the Borough and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Borough shall
jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another professional
engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
review the said expenses and make a determination as to the
amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
(3) The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence
and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his
or her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within
50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay
the entire amount determined in the decision immediately.
(4) In the event that the Borough and applicant cannot agree upon the
professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the billing
date, then, upon application of either party, the President Judge of
the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the
Borough is located (or if at the time there be no President Judge,
then the senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such
engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the Borough Engineer

§ 180-27. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final plat
the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate
bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the
proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered
by said security, the Borough Council may, at its option, install part of
such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development
and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the
moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of
the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any legal or
equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely
for the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not
for any other Borough purpose.
nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Borough or the applicant within the
preceding five years.
(5) The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in
the decision is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the
Borough shall pay the fee of the professional engineer, but
otherwise the Borough and the applicant shall each pay 1/2 of the
fee of the appointed professional engineer.

function and laid out to preserve the integrity of their design in
accordance with the following functional classifications:
(1) Minor service street. A street, usually within a development,
intended primarily to serve only the properties along it. Standards
assume light traffic flow and street parking along one side. When
such a street is intended to serve row or multifamily structures, the
standards provide for parking on both sides and light traffic flow.
Such streets should be laid out to discourage through traffic.
(2) Collector street. A street which connects residential service streets
to intercommunity streets or to neighborhood facilities. Standards

A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in a
civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay a
judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof.
No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the
date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable Rules of Civil
Procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the District Justice determining that there
has been a violation further determines that there was a good-faith
basis for the person, partnership, or corporation violating this chapter
to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there
shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the District
Justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.
C. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to

commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
D. District Justices shall have initial jurisdiction in proceedings brought
under this section.
A. In addition to other remedies, the Borough may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The
description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other
documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the
remedies herein provided.
B. The Borough may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has
been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real
§ 180-50 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 180-51
162:287
property in violation of this chapter. This authority to deny such a
permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
(1) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(2) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(3) The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(4) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as
to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
C. As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an
approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the Borough may require
compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to the
property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real
property.

This article shall be known and may be cited as "Earned Income Tax
Ordinance." The provisions hereof shall first become effective on January
1, 1973, and shall remain in effect on a calendar-year basis without annual
reenactment.
§ 185-12. Definitions and word usage.
A. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following terms shall have, for
the purpose of this article, the meanings indicated in this section:

of Greencastle, which was incorporated by the Commonwealth of

special or limited purpose, but with the present intention of making a

other permanent home. In the case of businesses, or associations, the

the place where its functions are discharged.

financial consideration of its equivalent, under an express or implied
contract, and who is under the control and direction of said other
person, and shall include persons employed on a temporary,

For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2013, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment within the Borough of
Greencastle during the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such
privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall pay the tax for that
year in the amount of $52, assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with
the provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the following
purposes as the same may be allocated by the Borough from time to
time: emergency services, which shall include emergency medical services,
police services and/or fire services; road construction and/or maintenance;
reduction of property taxes; or property tax relief through implementation
of a homestead and farmstead exclusion in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A.
Ch. 85, Subch. F (relating to homestead property exclusion). The political
subdivision shall use no less than 25% of the funds derived from the tax
for emergency services. This tax is in addition to all other taxes of any kind
or nature heretofore levied by the political subdivision. The tax shall be no
more than $52 on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the
number of political subdivisions within which a person may be employed.
§ 185-47.1. Exemption and refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
§ 185-47 GREENCASTLE CODE § 185-47.1
162:314
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating

to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds
made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day
the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the
calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Borough or the Collector shall determine eligibility
for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.

more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.

withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other

tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 185-50. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.

Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with

person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 185-47.1 of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days

All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and, in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision

It shall be unlawful for any person to park a vehicle or allow the same
to remain parked for longer than the time limit(s) prescribed from time
to time by the Borough Council and indicated on the legend of parking
meters, provided that the requirements of this article as to parking time
limits and as to deposit of coins in meters shall not apply on Sundays and
those holidays prescribed annually by the Borough Council.
§ 190-38. Placement and characteristics of meters.
Parking meters shall be installed in the parking meter zones established as
provided in § 190-36, and where installed shall be placed upon the sidewalk,
immediately adjacent to the individual parking spaces as described in
§ 190-39. Each meter shall be placed or set in such manner as to show that
the parking space adjacent to such meter is or is not legally occupied. Each
meter installed shall indicate by a proper legend the legal parking time
established by the Borough and, when occupied, shall indicate by its dial
and pointer the duration of the period of legal parking and, on expiration of
such period, shall indicate illegal or overtime parking.
§ 190-39. Parked vehicles to be wholly within marked spaces.
Lines and/or markings shall be painted or placed upon the curb, sidewalk
and/or street adjacent to each parking meter for the purpose of designating
the parking space for which such meter is to be used. Each vehicle parked
adjacent to any parking meter shall be parked wholly within the lines or
markings so placed and applicable to such meter. It shall be unlawful to
park any vehicle across any such line or marking, or to park any vehicle
§ 190-36 TREES § 190-39
187:363
in such a position that such vehicle shall not be wholly within the area so
designated by such lines or markings.
§ 190-40. Manner of parking at meter.
When a parking space in any parking meter zone is parallel with the
adjacent curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in such parking space shall
be parked so that the front of such vehicle shall be nearest to the parking
meter; when a parking space in any parking meter zone is diagonal to the
curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in such parking space shall be parked
with the front of such vehicle nearest to such meter.
§ 190-41. Coin deposit in meters.
Any person or persons causing a vehicle to be parked in a parking space
shall deposit in the parking meter adjacent to such space coin or coins of the
United States of America or a token or tokens as approved by the Borough
Council, according to the time limits and rates indicated on the legend of
such meter.
§ 190-42. Rates for parking.
The Borough Council of the Borough of Greencastle may, by resolution, from
time to time revise and change parking rates and determine the length of
time that parking is permissible in any individual parking space which is
regulated by the meter immediately adjacent thereto; and notice thereof
shall be given to the public, stating the length of time during which parking
is permitted and the conditions regulating the same, by either placing said
notice on the parking meter or in the immediate vicinity of said parking
facility.
§ 190-43. Unlawful to park after time on meter has elapsed;
evidence of violation.
Any person or persons who cause a vehicle to remain in a parking space
after the prescribed time, for which coins or tokens have been deposited,
has elapsed is hereby determined to be illegally parked; and each additional
hour that such person or persons permit such vehicle to remain in an
individual parking space after the prescribed time for parking has elapsed
is hereby declared to be an additional violation. The fact that a vehicle is
in an individual parking space when the time signal on the parking meter
regulating said parking space shows that no parking is permitted, or that
the time has expired, shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the unlawful
parking of said vehicle by its operator and/or owner. The elapse of one hour
from the time reported on the notice to the owner or operator of a motor
vehicle, shall be deemed prima facie evidence of additional violations of the
parking of said motor vehicle by the operator or owner.
§ 190-39 GREENCASTLE CODE § 190-44
187:364
§ 190-44. Unlawful to deposit coin in meter to extend parking time
beyond legal limit.

of increasing or extending the parking time of any vehicle beyond the total
legal parking time in a parking meter zone.
§ 190-45. Tampering with meters unlawful.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of this article for any person to deface,
tamper with, open or willfully break, destroy or impair the usefulness of any
parking meter, or parking meter stand or coin depository installed under
the provisions of this article; provided, nothing herein shall apply to the
servicing or opening of parking meters by officers, employees and/or police

(2) Challenges to the validity of a land use ordinance raising
procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption which challenges shall be raised by an
appeal taken within 30 days after the effective date of said

ordinance of the Borough and a Zoning Hearing Board has not been
previously established, the appeal raising procedural questions
shall be taken directly to court.
(3) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including,
but not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to
act on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease-and-desist
order or the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming

control and stormwater management insofar as the same relate to
development not involving applications under Article V or VII of the
MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10501 et seq. and 10701 et seq.
B. The Borough Council shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
render final adjudications in the following matters:
(1) All applications for approvals of planned residential developments
under Article VII of the MPC pursuant to the provisions of § 702 of
the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10702.

Zoning Officer or the Borough Engineer shall be to the Zoning
Hearing Board pursuant to this section. Where the applicable land
use ordinance vests jurisdiction for final administration of
subdivision and land development applications in the Planning
Commission, all appeals from determinations under this subsection

202:433
§ 205-44. Variances.
shall be to the Planning Commission and all appeals from the
decision of the Planning Commission shall be to court.
A. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of
application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
C. Variance procedures and requirements. Requests for variances within
an identified floodplain area shall be considered by the Zoning Hearing
Board in accordance with the following: [Added 1-3-2012 by Ord. No.
2012-0364]
64.Editor's Note: This ordinance provided for an effective date of 1-18-2012.
§ 205-43 GREENCASTLE CODE § 205-44
202:434
§ 205-45. Special exceptions.
(1) No variance shall be granted for any construction, development,
use or activity within any floodway area that would cause any
increase in the one-hundred-year-flood elevation.
(2) Except for a possible modification of the freeboard requirements
involved, no variance shall be granted for any of the other
requirements pertaining specifically to development which may
endanger human life.
(3) If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
(4) In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall attach
whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers
necessary in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare,
and to achieve the objectives of this chapter.
(5) Whenever a variance is granted, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
notify the applicant in writing that:
(a) The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
(b) Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
(6) In reviewing any request for a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall consider, but not be limited to the following:
(a) That there is good and sufficient cause.
(b) That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.
(c) That the granting of the variance will not result in an
unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood elevations,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimization of
the public or conflict with any other applicable local or state
ordinance and regulations.
(d) Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall
be designed and constructed so as to have the capability of
resisting the one-hundred-year flood.
(7) A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall
be maintained by the Zoning Hearing Board. In addition, a report of
all variances granted during the year shall be included in the
annual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
A. Where the Borough Council, in this chapter, has stated special
exceptions to be granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board
§ 205-44 YARD SALES § 205-45
202:435
pursuant to express standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and
decide requests for such special exceptions in accordance with such
standards and criteria. In granting a special exception, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
B. Review factors for special exceptions in floodplain districts. [Added
1-3-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-0365]
(1) In reviewing applications for special exceptions in floodplain
districts, as permitted by the Floodplain Management Ordinance66
or the Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
all relevant factors and procedures specific in other sections of the
Zoning Ordinance and:
(a) The danger to life and property due to increased flood
elevations or velocities caused by encroachments.
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and
unsanitary conditions.
(d) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owners.
(e) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
(g) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable
future.
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for the area.
(j) The safety of access to the property in time of flood of ordinary
and emergency vehicles.

§ 205-45 GREENCASTLE CODE § 205-45
202:436
§ 205-46. Time limitations.
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
(l) Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
chapter.
(2) Supplemental technical review. The Zoning Hearing Board may
refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining
to any request for a special exception to any engineer or other
qualified persons or agency for technical assistance in evaluating
the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and
the adequacy of the plans for protection and other related matters.
(3) Conditions for approving special exceptions.
(a) Special exceptions shall only be issued after the Zoning
Hearing Board has determined that the granting of such will
not result in:
[1] Unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights;
[2] Additional threats to public safety;
[3] Extraordinary public expense;
[4] The creation of nuisances;
[5] Any fraud or victimization of the public; or
[6] Any conflict with local laws or ordinances.
(b) No special exception shall be granted for any proposed use,
development, or activity within any floodway district (FW) that
will cause any increase in flood elevations.
A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by the Borough if such
proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any
manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice,
knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had been given. If
such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall
be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The failure of
anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on
a tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a
challenge to the validity of this chapter or an amendment hereto or map
or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final approval
except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates
from the approved tentative approval.

Appeals raising the substantive validity of any land use ordinance (except
those to be brought before the Borough Council pursuant to the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Code), procedural questions or alleged defects
B. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.
A. Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
and during its pendency before the Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning
Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall
be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or
body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order,
which may be granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction
of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed
to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
B. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to
petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.
C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond
and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a
bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the
petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney
fees incurred by the petitioner.

to register any nonconforming use, structure or lot; from a determination
by the Borough Engineer or the Zoning Officer with reference to the
administration of any floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such
provisions within a land use ordinance; from the determination of any

the determination of the Zoning Officer or Borough Engineer in the
administration of any land use ordinance or provision thereof with reference
to sedimentation and erosion control and stormwater management insofar
as the same relate to development not involving subdivision and land
development or planned residential development, may be filed with the
Zoning Hearing Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or
agency of the Borough, or any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance
and for special exception may be filed with the Board by any landowner or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner.

ARTICLE IX
Planning Commission
§ 205-49. Compliance.
Nothing in this chapter shall relieve the owner or his agent, the developer,
or the applicant for either a special exception permit or a site development
plan approval from receiving a subdivision plan approval in accordance with
the Borough Subdivision Ordinance (Chapter 180), if any.
§ 205-50. Approval of site development plans. [Amended 5-7-1984;
1-3-1995 by Ord. No. 1995-2]
In all cases where this chapter requires approval of site development plans
by the Commission, no building permit shall be issued except upon
authorization of and in conformity with the plans approved by the
Commission.
A. Objectives. In considering and acting upon site development plans the
Commission shall take into consideration the public health, safety and
welfare, the comfort and convenience of the public in general and of the
residents of the immediate neighborhood in particular, and may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be required in
order that the result of its action may, to the maximum extent possible,
further the express intent of this chapter and the accomplishment of the
following objectives in particular:
(1) Traffic access. That all proposed traffic access and ways are
adequate but not excessive in number; adequate in width, grade,
alignment and visibility; not located too near street corners or
other places of public assembly; and other similar safety
considerations.
(2) Circulation and parking. That adequate off-street parking and
loading spaces are provided to prevent parking in public streets of
vehicles of any person connected with or visiting the use and that
the interior circulation system is adequate to provide safe
accessibility to all required off-street parking lots.
(3) Landscaping and screening. That all playground, parking and
service areas are reasonably screened all seasons of the year from
the view of adjacent residential lots and streets and that the
general landscaping of the site is in character with that generally
prevailing in the neighborhood. Existing trees over four inches in
diameter measured 4 1/2 feet above the average ground level shall
be retained to the maximum extent possible.
(4) Illumination. The lighting from the installation of outdoor flood or
spot lighting and illuminated signs will be properly shielded so that
such lighting will not adversely affect any abutting property or
public street.

B. Procedure.
(1) Presubmission conference. Prior to the submission of a site
development plan, the applicant shall meet in person with the
Commission. The purpose of such conference shall be to discuss
proposed uses or development in order to determine which of the
site development plan elements listed in Subsection D shall be
submitted to the Commission in order for said Commission to
determine conformity with the provisions and intent of this chapter.
(2) Submission to commission. Within three months following the
presubmission conference, the site development plan and any
related information shall be submitted to the Commission in four
copies at least 30 days prior to the Commission meeting at which
approval is requested. If not submitted within this three-month
period another presubmission compliance shall be required.
(3) Referral to the County Planning and Zoning Commission. Should
any site development plan constitute a subdivision or land
development plan subject to the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance (Chapter 180), the procedures in said
ordinance concerning review of said plan by the County Planning
Commission shall then be applicable.
(4) Commission action. The Commission shall act to approve, modify
and approve, or disapprove any such site development plan within
60 days after the meeting at which approval is requested. Failure to
act within 60 days shall be deemed approval. Commission
disapproval shall include written findings upon any site
development plan element found contrary to the provisions or
intent of this chapter.
(5) Conditions and safeguards.
(6) Amendments to a site development plan shall be acted upon in the
same manner as the approval of the original plan.
(7) The Commission may require that site plan approval be periodically
reviewed.
C. Effect of site development plan approval.
(1) No building permit shall be issued for any structure covered by this
section until an approved site development plan or approved
amendment of any such plan has been secured by the applicant
from the Commission.

of land covered by this section unless the structure is completed or
the land is developed or used in accordance with an approved site
development plan or approved amendment of any such plan.

C. The Borough Council, if it determines that a validity challenge has
merit, may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without

affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of this chapter or Zoning Map.
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the
tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts; and
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
A. If the Borough determines that this chapter, or any portion hereof, is
substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:

validity of, this chapter pursuant to the provisions of § 609 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S.
§ 10609, in order to cure the declared invalidity of this chapter.
C. Upon the initiation of the procedures as set forth in Subsection A, the
Borough Council shall not be required to entertain or consider any
landowner's curative amendment filed under § 609.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S.
§ 10609.1, nor shall the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a
report requested under §§ 909.1 or 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10909.1
and 10916.1, subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon
the grounds identical or substantially similar to those specified by the
resolution required by Subsection A(1). Upon completion of the
procedures set forth in Subsections A and B, no rights to a cure
pursuant to the provisions of §§ 609.1 and 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S.
§§ 10609.1 and 10916.1, shall, from the date of the declaration and
proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive
invalidity of this chapter for which there has been a curative
amendment pursuant to this section.
D. The Borough, having utilized the procedures set forth in this section,
may not again utilize said procedure for a period of 36 months following
the date of enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the
validity of this chapter; provided, however, if after the date of
declaration and proposal there is a substantially new duty imposed
upon the Borough by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a
Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the Borough may utilize the
provisions of this section to propose a curative amendment to this
chapter to fulfill said duty or obligation.

Appeals
§ 205-57. Zoning appeals.
The proceedings set forth in this article shall constitute the exclusive mode
for securing review of this chapter, or decision, determinations or orders
issued by Borough Council, its agencies or officers pursuant to this chapter.
§ 205-58. Venue.
Appeals to a court shall be taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin
County.
§ 205-59. Validity of chapter; procedural questions.
Questions of an alleged defect in the process of enactment or adoption of
this chapter and map shall be raised by an appeal taken directly from the
action of the Borough Council to the court filed not later than 30 days from
the effective date of this chapter and map.
§ 205-60. Validity of ordinance; substantive questions. [Amended
1-3-1995 by Ord. No. 1995-2]
A. A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the
validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits
or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest
shall submit the challenge either:
(1) To the Zoning Hearing Board under § 205-43A(1) of this chapter; or
(2) To the Borough Council under § 205-43B(4), together with a
request for a curative amendment under § 609.1 of the
Municipalities Planning Code (hereafter "MPC"), 53 P.S. § 10609.1.
B. Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of
another by an ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desires
to challenge its validity on substantive grounds shall first submit their
challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision thereon under
§ 205-43A(1) of this chapter.
C. The submissions referred to in Subsections A and B shall be governed
by the following:
(1) In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the challenging
party shall make a written request to the Board that it hold a
hearing on its challenge. The request shall contain the reasons for
the challenge. Where the landowner desires to challenge the
validity of such ordinance and elects to proceed by curative
amendment under § 609.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10609.1, his
application to the Borough Council shall contain, in addition to the
requirements of the written request hereof, the plans and
§ 205-57 YARD SALES § 205-60
202:471
explanatory materials describing the use or development proposed
by the landowner in lieu of the use or development permitted by the
challenged ordinance or map. Such plans or other materials shall
not be required to meet the standards prescribed for preliminary,
tentative or final approval or for the issuance of a permit, so long as
they provide reasonable notice of the proposed use or development
and a sufficient basis for evaluating the challenged ordinance or
map in light thereof. Nothing herein contained shall preclude the
landowner from first seeking a final approval before submitting his
challenge.
(2) If the submission is made by the landowner to the Borough Council
under Subsection A(2), the request also shall be accompanied by an
amendment or amendments to the ordinance proposed by the
landowner to cure the alleged defects therein.
(3) If the submission is made to the Borough Council, the Borough
Solicitor shall represent and advise it at the hearing or hearings
referred to in § 909.1(b)(4) of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10909.1(b)(4).
(4) The Borough Council may retain an independent attorney to
present the defense of the challenged ordinance or map on its
behalf and to present their witnesses on its behalf.
(5) Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the
Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be,
shall determine whether the challenged ordinance or map is
defective, as alleged by the landowner. If a challenge heard by the
Borough Council is found to have merit, the Borough Council shall
proceed as provided in § 609.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10609.1. If a
challenge heard by the Zoning Hearing Board is found to have
merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include
recommended amendments to the challenged ordinance which will
cure the defects found. In reaching its decision, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall consider the amendments, plans and explanatory
material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
(b) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of
the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of person otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the
ordinance or map.
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features.
§ 205-60 GREENCASTLE CODE § 205-60
202:472
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and
any adverse environmental impacts.
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(6) The Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may
be, shall render its decision within 45 days after the conclusion of
the last hearing.
(7) If the Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case
may be, fails to act on the landowner's request within the time
limits referred to in Subsection C(6), a denial of the request is
deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last
hearing.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board or the Borough Council, as the case may be,
shall commence its hearing within 60 days after the request is filed
unless the landowner requests or consents to an extension of time.
E. Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of the
ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where and the
times when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory
material or proposed amendments may be examined by the public.
F. The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be,
fails to commence the hearing within the time limits set forth in
Subsection D.
(2) The Borough Council notifies the landowner that it will not adopt
the curative amendment.
(3) The Borough Council adopts another curative amendment which is
unacceptable to the landowner.
(4) The Zoning Hearing Board or the Borough Council, as the case may
be, fails to act on the request 45 days after the close of the last
hearing on the request, unless the time is extended by mutual
consent by the landowner and the Borough.
G. Where a curative amendment proposal is approved by the grant of a
curative amendment, application by the Borough Council pursuant to
§ 909.1(b)(4) of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10909.1(b)(4), or a validity challenge
is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to § 909.1(a)(1) of
the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10909.1(a)(1), or the court acts finally on appeal from
denial of a curative amendment proposal or a validity challenge, and
the proposal or challenge so approved requires a further application for
§ 205-60 YARD SALES § 205-60
202:473
§ 205-61. Procedure to obtain preliminary opinion. [Amended
1-3-1995 by Ord. No. 1995-2]
In order not to unreasonably delay the time when a landowner may secure
assurance that the ordinance or map under which he proposed to build is
free from challenge, and recognizing that the procedure for preliminary
approval of his development may be too cumbersome or may be unavailable,
the landowner may advance the date from which time for any challenge to
the ordinance or map will run under § 914.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10914.1,
by the following procedure:
subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two years
from the date of such approval to file an application for preliminary
or tentative approval pursuant to Article V or VII of the MPC, 53
P.S. § 10501 et seq. and 10701 et seq. Within the two-year period, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other
governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which
adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative
amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Upon the filing of the
preliminary or tentative plan, the provisions of § 508(4) of the MPC,
53 P.S. § 10508(4), shall apply. Where the proposal appended to the
curative amendment application or the validity challenge is approved
but does not require further application under any subdivision or land
development ordinance, the developer shall have one year within which
to file for a building permit. Within the one-year period, no subsequent
change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely
affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative amendment
or the sustained validity challenge. During these protected periods, the
court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding
such supplemental relief as may be necessary.
A. The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing his
proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a preliminary
opinion as to their compliance with the applicable ordinances and
maps. Such plans and other materials shall not be required to meet the
standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for
the issuance of a building permit so long as they provide reasonable
notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for a
preliminary opinion as to its compliance.
B. If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof shall
be published once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the Borough. Such notice shall include a
general description of the proposed use or development and its
location, by some readily identifiable directive, and the place and times
where the plans and other materials may be examined by the public.
The favorable preliminary approval under § 914.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S.
§ 10914.1, and the time therein specified for commencing a proceeding
§ 205-60 GREENCASTLE CODE § 205-61
202:474
with the Board shall run from the time the second notice thereof has
been published.
