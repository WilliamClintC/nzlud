PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Aiken, South Carolina. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through April, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Code Attorney, and Bill Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Sara Ridout, City Clerk, Richard Pearce, City Solicitor/Staff Attorney and Gary Smith, III, City Attorney for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  The members of city council, the mayor pro tem, and the mayor shall also be entitled to be reimbursed the actual expenses they incur for attending functions for professional development, or where members of council are acting in their official capacity as a representative of the city or they are otherwise performing their official duties. This reimbursement shall be paid upon submission of a signed city reimbursement form as provided by the finance department. 
(d)  The mayor shall be authorized to use an automobile purchased or leased by the city during his term of service as mayor. The guidelines for the use of this automobile shall be the same as those which govern the use of city vehicles by department heads. 
(e)  The members of the city council, the mayor pro tem, and the mayor shall be allowed to participate in the city's retirement plan as set forth in such retirement plan. 
(f)  Members of the city council, including the mayor, are eligible to continue to participate in the city's health insurance program. They must be participants in the city employees' retirement plan who retire on or after attaining age 55 with at least 12 years of service. 
(1)  An eligible council member who retires with at least 12 years of service with the city but is less than age 55 may continue his coverage under the city's health insurance program at his own cost until attaining age 55. At age 60, the city will offset any monthly pension check which may be payable to a former member of the council by the monthly premium for health insurance payable by the former member. The remaining portion of the pension check shall be directly deposited by the city. 
(2)  All eligible council members who retire on or after age 55 may elect to continue their health insurance coverage and the cost of continued coverage shall be divided between the city and the retiree as follows: 
Retirement at or After 
Age 55 With Years of 
Service 	Percentage of Cost Paid 
by City 
Less than 12 	 0 
12 	28 
15 	40 
20 	60 
25 	80 
 
An additional four percent is added for each full year of service after 12 years up to 25 years of service. Example: For 12 years of service, the city will pay 28 percent of the cost of health insurance coverage. In no event will the city pay more than 80 percent of the monthly insurance premium. 
(3)  The city reserves the right to change or modify its health insurance program from time to time, and continue coverage as is available under the health insurance program as modified from time to time. 
(4)  A former council member's election to continue coverage under the city's health insurance program must be made at the time of the member's retirement when the member is first eligible to elect continued health insurance coverage. If the member fails to elect to continue coverage under the city's health insurance program at the time the member is first eligible, the former member may not later elect to participate. Also, if the former member elects to participate in the city's health insurance program after retirement and later stops participating or the coverage ceases due to the member's failure to pay the required premiums, the member shall not be allowed to rejoin or re-elect health insurance coverage under the city's program. 
(5)  The mayor and council members shall be responsible for 100 percent of any dependent coverage for health insurance.

(b)  The city manager may, if time permits, give notice to the local news media or anyone requesting in writing advance notice that a conference meeting will be held pursuant to law without stating the specific matters to be discussed. When advance notice is not given, the city manager may give notice of such meeting after it has been held. 
(c)  No vote of the council shall be necessary to call a conference meeting. 
(Code 1980, § 2-32)  
Sec. 2-63. - Quorum; presiding officer; rules of order. 
A majority of the members of the council serving shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business at any meeting. The mayor or mayor pro tempore shall preside, except that, in the absence of both, the members shall elect a presiding member. Except as otherwise required by state law or this Code, all proceedings of the council shall be governed by Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised. 
(Code 1980, § 2-33)  
Sec. 2-64. - Rules of order. 
(a)  Rules of procedure. 
(1)  Authority. S.C. Code 1976, § 5-7-250 provides that: "The council shall determine its own rules and order of business and shall provide for keeping minutes of its proceedings which shall be a public record." 
(2)  Purpose. The purpose of city council in adopting rules of order is to enable the council to transact business with speed and efficiency while protecting the rights of all persons whether in the majority or the minority. Arbitrary technical rules must not prevent the council from accomplishing the public's business. Therefore, it is the intent of the council that common sense and courtesy be applied when enforcing the rules of procedure so that the will of the majority of the council may be achieved while insuring that all positions are heard and considered. 
(3)  Presiding officer. Normally the mayor or, in the mayor's absence, the mayor pro tempore, shall preside at any meeting. Notwithstanding that however, city council may, upon motion passed by a two-thirds majority of all council members serving, elect a council chairperson and vice-chairperson who shall then serve as presiding officer at all future meetings until the next general or special election at which any member of the council, including the mayor, is elected and takes office. In the event that the mayor or mayor pro tempore (or chairperson or vice-chairperson) is not in attendance or is ineligible to preside at any meeting, the members present shall elect a member to preside. 
(4)  Order of business. The standard order of business, which shall be reflected in the meeting agenda, shall be as follows: 
a.  Call to order. 
b.  Invocation. 
c.  Pledge of allegiance. 
d.  Approval or correction of agenda. [3] 
e.  Approval or correction of minutes. 
f.  Public requests, presentation of petitions, awards, memorials. 
g.  Nonagenda items from the public (total time limited to 30 minutes and each speaker limited to three minutes). 
h.  Second reading and adoption of ordinances. 
i.  First reading and advertisement of ordinances. 
j.  Resolutions. 
k.  Motions. 
l.  Nonagenda items from the public (each speaker limited to three minutes). 
m.  Communications from the city council and the city manager. 
n.  Reports and information presentations from city staff. 
o.  Executive session. [4] 
p.  Adjournment. 
(5)  Procedure pursuant to the agenda. 
a.  Information and presentation items. Many items on a meeting agenda do not involve a decision making or legislative action on the part of the council. These include the invocation, presentations, awards, and nonagenda items from the public. When these items are reached on the agenda, the presiding officer should simply announce them and introduce the individual or group who will be making the presentation or providing the information. If a discussion involving the presenters and council members is appropriate, the presiding officer should control the discussion to maintain proper decorum and to insure that the discussion remains relevant to the agenda topic. When it becomes apparent that the subject has been thoroughly covered or the discussion has become redundant or strayed from the topic, the presiding officer should, with the consensus of the council, end the discussion and announce the next agenda item. 
b.  Legislative items. The council takes action by resolution or ordinance. Ordinances must be in writing and in the form required for final adoption when introduced. Resolutions are most commonly introduced in writing but may be introduced and approved in oral form. Upon reaching an ordinance or resolution on the agenda, the presiding officer will read the ordinance or resolution by title (or the presiding officer may ask the city clerk to read it) and ask the city manager to present a brief explanation of the ordinance to include its expected effect and who has proposed it. The manager may ask a staff member or a retained expert to give this briefing. 
After the manager's briefing, the presiding officer will call for a motion from the council. If no motion is made, or if the motion is not seconded, the presiding officer will move on to the next agenda item. If a motion is made and seconded, the presiding officer will call for discussion in the following order: 
1.  The applicant or its representative. Council members may ask questions of the applicant or its representative during the applicant's presentation. 
2.  Individuals to address council. [5] Any citizen, resident, or other interested individual may address council during the first or second reading of an ordinance or resolution. The presiding officer may alternate between proponents and opponents when recognizing individuals to address council. Council members may ask questions of the individual during the individual's presentation. 
3.  The mayor and members of council. During the presentation of each member of council and the mayor, they may also ask questions of any speaker who will be asked to return to the podium to respond to the questions. 
After the discussion is completed, the presiding officer shall, if the motion has not been disposed of or postponed by subsidiary motion, immediately restate the motion before council and call for the vote of council. Following the vote, the presiding officer should immediately announce the results. 
c.  Nonagenda items. Nonagenda items from the public or staff will be accepted only for the information of the council. 
(6)  Motions. A motion is the means by which the city council takes any legislative action. Motions are ranked in order of precedence: a motion may be made only if no motion of equal or higher precedence is on the floor. The precedence of each motion is indicated in brackets after its title. All motions must be seconded, and are adopted by majority vote unless otherwise noted. All motions may be debated unless otherwise noted. These motions (indicated by an asterisk) may be made at any time that they are relevant to the issue presently on the floor or the decision which has just been made: 
a.  Motion to adjourn [1]. Not debatable; goes to immediate majority vote. 
b.  Call for the orders of the day [1]. Directs the presiding officer to return to the approved agenda. Not debatable. 
c.  Call the question [1]. Not debatable. Closes debate on the motion on the floor and forces a vote on that motion. Requires a two-thirds-majority vote. 
d.  Motion to limit or extend limits of debate [2]. Not debatable, can be amended, requires a two-thirds-majority vote. 
e.  Motion to refer [2]. Should specify which committee, board, or commission the matter is to be referred to, what council expects the group to do, and when it should be reported back to council. Approval of this motion ends discussion of the matter and the presiding officer should proceed to the next agenda item. 
f.  Motion to continue [3]. May be made instead of a main motion when an agenda item comes before the council or at any time before the main motion is disposed of. Should specify when the matter is to be brought back before the council and what action or information is desired before it is brought back. If approved it ends consideration of the agenda item for the current meeting and the presiding officer should move to the next item. 
g.  Motion to amend [3]. 
h.  Main motion [4]. 
i.  Motion to appeal decision of the presiding officer. [6] Not debatable. Requires immediate vote. Always stated by presiding officer so that a yes vote sustains his or her decision. Presiding officer retains the chair, but must proceed as voted by the majority. 
j.  Object to the consideration of a question.* Once agenda is approved, requires two-thirds-majority vote. Not debatable. 
k.  Point of order.* This is a request from a member for action by the presiding officer and may be made even when someone else has been recognized to speak. No second is required; no amendment is permitted; and no vote is required unless the presiding officer asks the council to decide the issue or the decision of the presiding officer is appealed. The point of order is frequently used to question a procedure undertaken by the presiding officer or to suggest an alternate procedure to the presiding officer. 
l.  Motion to reconsider.* May only be made before adjournment of the meeting at which the original action was taken. Must be made by a council member who voted on the winning side on the original action. Nothing in this subsection should be construed to prevent the original matter from being placed on the agenda for a subsequent meeting if requested by at least three council members. After 90 days, the original matter may be added to a meeting agenda using the same procedure as with any other matter not previously decided by council. 
m.  Motion to suspend the rules.* Can be made at any time that no question is pending. If a matter is before the council and the motion to suspend is applicable to that matter, the motion to suspend takes precedence over all other motions. It is not debatable or amendable and requires a two-thirds-majority to pass. This motion permits the council to do something it wishes to do but cannot without violating one or more of the rules contained in its rules of procedure. This motion cannot be used to modify or suspend any requirement of state law. 
(7)  Public hearings. A public hearing is a special type of meeting. It is intended to provide the council the opportunity to gather information from public input and provide information to the public. State law requires that a public hearing be conducted under certain circumstances. The presiding officer should call the hearing to order and announce the purpose of the hearing. The presiding officer should recognize individuals who wish to address council and should ensure that representatives of all competing views have a fair opportunity to express those views. The council can take no action during the public hearing. 
A public hearing may be a separate meeting or may be held during a regular council meeting. If it is during a regular council meeting it generally occurs at the point on the agenda where the subject of the public hearing is listed for action. In that case the presiding officer must clearly announce the start of the hearing and the adjournment of the hearing so that it is clear when the special rules applicable to the hearing apply and when the rules of procedure for regular council business are restored. A record of each public hearing must be kept and should include: 
a.  A hearing agenda. 
b.  A record of all the members of the public who participate. 
c.  Proof of any required notice or publication. 
d.  Minutes or a tape of the proceedings. 
e.  Copies of any materials received from the public or distributed to the public. 
(8)  Disruptive conduct. These rules of procedure are adopted based on the expectation that all persons attending a meeting of the city council will be honorable and will conduct themselves with courtesy for all other individuals present. In most situations where an individual's conduct becomes disruptive, it will be inadvertent and a warning from the presiding officer will be sufficient to correct the offensive behavior. If that is not the case, or if the presiding officer is determined by council to be disrupting or obstructing the proceedings of a council meeting, the following shall apply. 
a.  It is unlawful for any person to disrupt a meeting of city council. If a person who is determined by the presiding officer, or by a majority vote of council, to be disruptive, refuses to discontinue the disruptive behavior, the matter will be immediately reported to the police department who will, upon responding, take necessary action to end the disruption. Action by the police may include, if necessary, removing the offending individual from the meeting room. 
b.  In a case where the disruptive person is a member of council, a determination that the disruptive behavior is in violation of these rules shall be made by a majority vote of council. 
c.  If the presiding officer refuses to call for action on a matter on an approved agenda, ignores a motion apparently made and seconded in good faith, refuses to allow council to vote on an appeal from a decision or ruling of the presiding officer, or in any other way refuses to conduct the meeting in accordance with these rules, council may by majority vote declare the chair vacated. Any council member may move to vacate the chair based on the refusal of the presiding officer and, upon receiving a second, the member who made the motion may call for the immediate vote of council. If the motion receives a majority vote the position of presiding officer shall be filled for the remainder of the meeting as provided in subsection (b)(3) of this section, as if the presiding officer were absent. Unless the original presiding officer is removed from the meeting as provided in subsection (b)(8)a of this section, he shall be permitted to remain in the meeting and participate as any other council member. 
(9)  Items not covered. Any matter or order of procedure not covered by these rules shall be referred to the presiding officer who shall decide the matter in conformity with the purpose of these rules. The decision of the presiding officer may be reversed on appeal by a majority vote of council.

Editor's note The South Carolina Freedom of Information Act requires that an agenda be advertised 24 hours before the scheduled meeting time. It has been argued by some parties that this prevents the amendment of the agenda after the advertisement. The better argument seems to be that when it is necessary in the public interest to add a matter to the agenda after it is published, the council may do so.

Sec. 2-349. - Construction. 
(a)  Definitions. 
Construction manager agent means a business that has been awarded a separate contract with the city to provide construction management services but not construction. 
Construction manager at-risk means a business that has been awarded a separate contract with the city to provide both construction management services and construction using the construction management at-risk project delivery method. A contract with a construction manager at-risk may be executed before completion of design. 
Construction management services are those professional services associated with contract administration, project management, and other specified services provided in connection with the administration of a project delivery method defined in this section 2-349. 
Construction management at-risk means a project delivery method in which the city awards separate contracts, one for architectural and engineering services to design an infrastructure facility and the second to a construction manager at-risk for both construction of the infrastructure facility according to the design and construction management services. 
Design-bid-build means a project delivery method in which the city sequentially awards separate contracts, the first for architectural and engineering services to design an infrastructure facility and the second for construction of the infrastructure facility according to the design. 
Design-build means a project delivery method in which the city enters into a single contract for design and construction of an infrastructure facility. 
Design-build-operate-maintain means a project delivery method in which the city enters into a single contract for design, construction, maintenance, and operation of an infrastructure facility over a contractually defined period. All or a portion of the money required to pay for the services provided by the contractor during the contract period are (1) appropriated by the city, (2) secured by the city through fare, toll, or user charges, (3) provided in the form of a concession agreement with the contractor or an assignee, or (4) any combination of the foregoing. 
Infrastructure facility means a building; structure; or networks of buildings, structures, pipes, controls, and equipment, or portion thereof. 
Operations and maintenance means a project delivery method in which the City enters into a single contract for the routine operation, routine repair, and routine maintenance of an infrastructure facility. 
(b)  Construction services authorization. 
(1)  Project delivery methods authorized. 
a.  The following project delivery methods are authorized for procurements relating to infrastructure facilities: (a) design-bid-build; (b) construction management at-risk; (c) operations and maintenance; (d) design-build; (e) design-build-operate-maintain. 
b.  In addition to those methods identified in item (1), the Council may approve as an alternate project delivery method any combination of design, construction, finance, and services for operations and maintenance of an infrastructure facility. 
c.  Participation in a report or study that is later used in the preparation of design requirements for a project does not disqualify a firm from participating as a member of a proposing team in a construction management at-risk, design-build, or design-build-operate-maintain delivery procurement, unless the participation provides the business with a substantial competitive advantage. 
(2)  Choice of project delivery method. The project delivery method used for a city construction project must be that method which is most advantageous to the city and results in the most timely, economical, and successful completion of the construction project. The city shall select the appropriate project delivery method for a particular project and shall state in writing the facts and considerations leading to the selection of that particular method. 
(3)  Source selection methods assigned to project delivery methods. 
a.  Competitive sealed bidding, as provided in this Code, must be used to procure construction in design-bid-build procurements. 
b.  Construction management at-risk. Contracts for construction management at-risk must be procured by either competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposals. 
c.  Operations and maintenance. Contracts for operations and maintenance must be procured by either competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposals. 
d.  Design-build. Contracts for design-build must be procured by competitive sealed proposals. 
e.  Design-build-operate-maintain. Contracts for design-build-operate-maintain must be procured by competitive sealed proposals. 
f.  Other. Contracts for an alternate project delivery method approved by the council must be procured by a source selection method specified by the council when approving the alternative project delivery method. 
g.  The procedures for receipt and evaluation of competitive sealed proposals applicable to a solicitation will be outlined in that solicitation. 
(4)  Prequalification on construction. The city may limit participation in a solicitation for construction to only those businesses, including potential subcontractors, that are prequalified. If businesses are prequalified, the city must issue a request for qualifications. The request must contain, at a minimum, a description of the general scope of work to be acquired, the deadline for submission of information, and how businesses may apply for consideration. The evaluation criteria must include, but not be limited to, prior performance, recent past references on all aspects of performance, financial stability, and experience on similar construction projects. Using only the criteria stated in the request for qualifications, businesses must be ranked from most qualified to least qualified. The basis for the ranking must be determined in writing. If fewer than two businesses are prequalified, the prequalification process must be canceled. The determination regarding how many offers to solicit is not subject to protest. 
(5)  Additional procedures applicable to procurement of certain project delivery methods. 
a.  Evaluation factors. A request for proposals for design-build or design-build-operate-maintain must: (a) state the relative importance of (i) demonstrated compliance with the design requirements, (ii) offer or qualifications, (iii) financial capacity, (iv) project schedule, (v) price, or life-cycle price for design-build-operate-maintain (including the effects of proposed or alternative short- and long-term financing options), and (vi) other factors, if any. 
(c)  Integration with remainder of city procurement code. This section 2-349 supplements the tools available to the city under Aiken City Code, Division 2, Purchasing and Sales, but the specific provisions of this section 2-349 in a procurement activity will supersede incompatible provisions of any other section of Aiken City Code, Division 2, Purchasing and Sales. For example, but not by way of exhaustive listing: the use of competitive sealed proposals is incompatible with provisions requiring award to "lowest bid" and the like (e.g., sections 2-232, -233, -234, -238(b)), but compatible general requirements such as advertising (section 2-324), security (section 2-337), and responsibility (section 2-338(b)(1) et seq.) will apply to procurements under this section 2-349.

State Law reference Levy on and seizure of intangibles, S.C. Code 1976, § 12-53-20.  
Sec. 2-367. - Procedures. 
(a)  The city shall notify a delinquent debtor of its intention to cause the debtor's state tax refund to be setoff by notice given in person, left at the dwelling or usual place of business of the debtor, or sent by certified or registered mail to the debtor's last known address no less than 30 days before the city submits its setoff request to the state tax commission, or any successor agency. The notice shall include a statement which sets forth the administrative appeal procedures available to the debtor provided by this section and any alternatives available to the debtor which may avoid the setoff. The city shall promptly notify the debtor when the liability out of which the setoff arises has been satisfied. 
(b)  If a debtor disputes that he owes a delinquent debt or the amount of a delinquent debt, the debtor may submit a written request for review of the debt to the city manager. The city manager shall review all of the relevant facts to determine whether the debt is owed and whether the amount claimed by the city is correct. If the city manager determines the amount setoff exceeds the amount properly due, the city shall refund the appropriate amount to the debtor. If the city manager determines that the city is entitled to no part of the amount setoff, the city shall refund the entire amount plus any administrative fee retained by the state tax commission, or any successor agency, to the debtor. If a tax refund has been setoff based upon an error committed by the city, the city shall pay the debtor interest as required by the Setoff Debt Collection Act. If the debtor's request is received and resolved prior to a setoff request being submitted to the state tax commission, or any successor agency, the amount of the delinquent debt owned shall be adjusted accordingly. The city manager may decline to consider a debtor's request received more than 30 days after the city sends the debtor the notice required by subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  Upon receipt by the city of proceeds collected on its behalf by the state tax commission, or any successor agency, together with an accounting therefor, the city shall credit the debtor's obligation and notify the debtor in writing of the amount of the setoff and the balance due, if any.

(Code 1980, § 2-182)  
Sec. 2-369. - Collection costs charge. 
To the extent allowed by law, the city manager may set and assess against delinquent debtors a charge for the estimated actual costs to the city of collecting debts pursuant to this division, and the charge shall be added to and become part of such delinquent debt. If the city contracts with another agency or entity for services related to this collection procedure, the collection charges of that agency or entity shall be added to and become part of the delinquent debt, to the extent allowed by law, in the same manner as the city charge. The city manager shall notify the city council of the schedule of collection charges and any changes therein.

Sec. 2-386. - Owners to apply. 
An owner of more than 500 acres of land located outside, but contiguous to, the city who plans to develop this property for residential and/or commercial purposes may apply to the city manager for the annexation incentive program. 
(Ord. No. 03262001A, § 1, 3-26-2001)  
Sec. 2-387. - Requirements to qualify for incentive. 
(a)  The property to be annexed by the owner shall comprise more than 500 acres of real estate presently located outside the city limits of the City of Aiken. The property must be contiguous to the city limits. 
(b)  The owner must file an annexation petition with the city planning department. This petition shall include a copy of the deed showing that the applicant is the actual owner of the real estate. The owner shall also file a recent plat showing that all of the property owned by the owner is to be annexed. The petition shall also describe any areas on the property that will become common areas for the proposed development and/or what portions of the real estate will not be developed. 
(c)  The property must be accepted for annexation by the city council following a review by the planning commission.

(Ord. No. 03262001A, § 1, 3-26-2001)  
Sec. 2-388. - Incentive payment. 
(a)  If approved by city council, the owner shall be entitled to an incentive payment for up to three years to be determined by applying the following formula: 
No. of acres owned by owner at the end of the applicable year × per acre/per lot appraised value [per the county assessor] × .06 × The applicable millage rate = incentive payment 
(b)  The number of acres entitled to this incentive shall initially be determined in a written agreement between the owner and the city council. This incentive may be set forth in a development agreement if one is entered into by the owner and the city. Thereafter, the number of acres entitled to the reimbursement shall be reduced by the number of acres/lots sold by the owner in each calendar year. The owner shall provide a copy of each deed to the city to show all real estate sold by the owner during each calendar year. Failure of the owner to provide a copy of all deeds for property sold during the applicable year may result in the termination of this incentive payment for the particular development and will enable the city to seek reimbursement of all previous incentives paid. This property and its acreage shall be clearly delineated on the plat presented to the city. The owner must be current on all real estate tax payments for the property in order to apply for the incentive program. 
(c)  In no event shall the owner be entitled to this incentive for more than three years except that property being developed as a golf course may be entitled to this incentive for up to five years. This shall be more particularly described in the agreement to be executed by the city and the owner. 
(d)  The owner shall apply for this incentive on or before January 10 of the year following the calendar year for which the incentive is sought. No incentive shall be paid for the initial year that the property is annexed. The city shall have up to 60 days to confirm the owner's entitlement to the incentive being requested.

(4)  Such other incentives that the council, at its discretion on a case-by-case basis, determines are appropriate given the amount or type of investment made by the project sponsor. 
(d)  State incentive programs. The council may include within any package of incentives or as a stand-alone incentive for in-city project any incentive authorized by statute ("state incentive programs"). 
(Ord. No. 08132018 , § 1, 8-13-2018)

(b)  Additional criteria. The council may, in its discretion and on a case-by-case basis, include within an incentive agreement any other eligibility criteria, including, without limitation, capital investment and job creation benchmarks, that must be met upon completion of a project in order to ensure that the goals are met and that the project provides benefits to the city and its citizens that exceed the value of the incentives provided.

(5)  Any other additional information that the project sponsor or the city manager deems may be necessary and helpful for the council to evaluate and give due consideration to the proposal. 
(b)  Determination of incentive amounts. The amount of incentives granted to a project shall be based upon the amount of the capital investment in the project, the amount of new revenue for the city directly created by the project, and the number of new jobs that will be directly created by the project. The amount of incentives granted to a project shall in no case exceed the value of the tangible and intangible benefits of the project to the city and its citizens. 
(c)  Certification, commencement and continuation of incentives. 
(1)  No incentive shall commence or be given until 12 months after the project has been issued a certificate of occupancy and/or a business license and the project sponsor has provided sufficient proof that all terms and benchmarks included within the applicable incentive agreement, including without limitation benchmarks for capital investment, property valuation, and job creation, have been fully achieved or otherwise completed. 
(2)  Where benchmarks, such as the number of jobs created or the continuous operation of a business, are to be met continuously over a period of time, the project sponsor shall provide to the city, on an annual basis, sufficient proof that the project has continuously achieved or otherwise complied with such requirements upon the anniversary of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(3)  If, at any time after completion of a project or at any time within the period of time during which a project is granted incentives, a project fails to achieve or otherwise comply with any benchmark or other requirement, the council may, at its discretion and on a case-by-case basis: 
a.  Declare the incentive agreement null and void and refuse to grant any future incentives; or 
b.  Decrease the amount of incentives based upon the actual direct and indirect benefits of the project to the city and its citizens.

(u)  Notice procedures for vacant, unsecured, or boarded buildings. Whenever the code official determines that a vacant, unsecured, or boarded building exists, a notice shall be sent to the owner or responsible party in accordance with the Aiken City Code. 
(v)  Trespass notice. The code official may also require the owner of the property to post "no trespassing" signs on the property and sign a letter with the city of Aiken public safety department authorizing the department to enforce no trespassing on the premises. 
(w)  Continuing nuisance. When the owner of a boarded or vacant building fails to maintain the property in accordance with this section or when repeated violations of this section occur for the same property, the code official may seek other remedies as provided by this code, local ordinances or state law including but not limited to demolition of the structure. 
(x)  Emergency hazard abatement. When any open building or structure constitutes such an imminent threat to life, limb or property such that it must be secured, closed or barricaded and compliance with other provisions of this code becomes infeasible as determined by the code official, the code official may summarily secure, close, or barricade the building without prior notice to the property owner. All costs of boarding shall be recovered pursuant to the procedures in the Aiken City Code. 
(y)  Upon failure to comply with the notice of violation, any duly authorized employee of the city or contractor hired by the city shall be authorized to enter upon the property in violation and cut and destroy the weeds growing thereon.

(2)  Any premises or part thereof on which such growth may be reasonably demonstrated to be for agricultural, horticultural or equestrian use and which is properly tended. Land that is being tilled and farmed must be cleared after the growing season to maintain grass, weeds, and undergrowth to the maximum height requirements of 12 inches (305 mm). 
(3)  Undeveloped woodlands in a natural state. 
(4)  Rough areas including areas of extreme grade, creek banks or gullies that cannot be safely maintained without specialized equipment. 
(5)  Wetlands, woodlands, forested areas, and areas within fifteen feet of a stream or pond. 
(6)  Any resident with an illness or physical limitation, the elderly and disabled, at their legal residence who apply for a temporary waiver of this section until suitable arrangements for compliance have been secured.

Sec. 10-9. - The City of Aiken Facade Improvement Grant Program. 
(a)  Purpose. The city establishes this grant program to encourage the renovation of building facades in the downtown area. The city recognizes that the front facades of older buildings occasionally need restoration to preserve and promote an attractive looking downtown area. These improvement efforts stabilize or even increase property values and can help to attract new business and development into an area. Building facades represent the public face of private structures, and as such, they have much to do with the physical image of a community and how it is perceived by residents, developers and visitors. 
(b)  The grant. The financial incentive has the following elements: 
(1)  The city will pay one half the cost of an improvement project up to a maximum city contribution of $10,000.00. The cost of the facade improvement shall be determined from a review of the improvement project building permit or other appropriate documentation for those improvement projects that do not require a building permit. 
(2)  The owner must initially pay the cost of restoring the facade. Once facade improvements are completed to city Code standards and in keeping with Aiken Downtown Design Guideline, the city will reimburse the owner for the appropriate grant amount. 
(3)  Since these monies are being paid under a grant program, they do not have to be repaid. 
(4)  This program may be terminated by the City of Aiken at any time that there are not sufficient funds available to fund this incentive program. 
(5)  Owner shall determine whether this property qualifies for a grant at the time the building permit is issued. 
(c)  Eligible structures. 
(1)  The building must be in the area zoned Downtown Business (DB) under the city's zoning ordinance. 
(2)  The facade to be improved must be contiguous to, and visible from, a public right-of-way or alleyway, including, but not limited to, Bee Lane, The Alley, Sea Lane, and Hoods Lane. 
(d)  Facade improvements. The facade grant may be used for the following: 
(1)  Demolition, only if it is associated with, and followed by, a facade renovation project. 
(2)  Exterior improvements including, but not limited to, correction of exterior code violations, painting and siding, exterior repairs, door and window replacement, trimwork, enhanced entryways, display windows, or any other work as approved by the planning director. 
(e)  Design issues. The city is interested in promoting good design of downtown buildings that is in character with the area's architectural history. In order to further that goal, grant applicants must meet the design standards for facade renovation that are in keeping with the city's design guidelines for the downtown area. 
(f)  Approval process. 
(1)  Façade is defined as any exterior face or wall of a building from the grade level to the top of the parapet or eaves, the entire building width, any associated structural elements including porches, but specifically excluding roofs, dormers, entrance floors, domes, cupolas, steeples, chimneys [unless part of the façade], and turrets. 
(2)  Certificates of appropriateness from the design review board must be obtained, where necessary, prior to any work being commenced. 
(3)  A final form supplied by the planning department and documenting the costs and nature of the work must be submitted to the planning department within 90 days of final approval by the city building inspector, or, where no such inspection is required, within 90 days of final payment for the work. 
(4)  The planning director shall determine whether the request should be approved and may exclude any ineligible work. Written notice of the planning director's decision shall be mailed to the applicant within 60 days of submission. The decision of the planning director may be appealed to the city manager in writing within five days of the mailing of the decision. The decision of the city manager shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 09122005B, § 1, 9-12-2005; Ord. No. 06122006, § 1, 6-12-2006; Ord. No. 06102019 , § 1, 6-10-2019)  
Sec. 10-10. - Redevelopment incentiveUse of empty buildings. 
(a)  Purpose. The City of Aiken hereby establishes the empty building incentive program to encourage the use and/or redevelopment of empty buildings located throughout the city. The city recognizes that there are any number of reasons that contribute to building vacancies. With this program, the city offers an opportunity to assist new owners in reducing the overhead costs for a startup business. The city also seeks to reduce the number of vacated buildings located throughout the city to preserve and promote an attractive-looking city and to enhance the value of real estate throughout the city. As an additional purpose, the city seeks to reduce development sprawl by encouraging existing buildings to be reused. This will reduce development costs as well as the cost of public services to the business community. In most cases, water, sewer and other infrastructure is already available to old, unoccupied buildings. There is no added cost of running utility lines to more distant locations. Also, by using existing buildings, which usually are located in already developed areas, we may reduce fuel costs and traffic volumes within the city. 
(b)  Incentive. For qualifying buildings, the owner shall be entitled to an incentive payment to be determined by applying the following formula: 
(1)  The total assessed value of the subject property (building and land) as determined by Aiken County prior to construction is subtracted from the total assessed value for the property after construction is complete. This is the difference in the improvements to the subject property (increase in value). 
(2)  The increase in value is then multiplied by .04 for residential uses and .06 for commercial uses. This sum is then multiplied by the city's then current millage rate (presently .071, as of the 2004-05 fiscal year). That sum is then multiplied by the applicable multiplier based on the number of years the building has been vacant. This is the total incentive payment. The city will then issue a check to the owner for the full amount of the incentive payment. 
Example: Redevelopment of a property currently assessed by Aiken County at $6,000.00 results in a new assessed value of $100,000.00. The building has been empty for more than four years. The calculation looks like this: 
$94,000.00 increase in value 
× 4 percent (6 percent if commercial property; 10.5 percent if industrial property) 
________ 
$3,760.00 
× .071 (city millage rate at time of calculation) 
________ 
$267.00 
× 3 
________ 
$800.88 (total incentive payment) 
The owner must be current on all real estate tax payments for the property in order to apply for the incentive program. The city shall have up to 60 days to confirm the owner's entitlement to the incentive being requested. The amount of the incentive is based on the number of years the building has been continuously vacant. 
Example: If your building qualifies and has been vacant for more than four years, your multiplier is three. 
Incentive Scale 
Continuous Vacancy (months) 	Incentive Multiplier 
024 	No Incentive 
2436 	1 year 
3648 	2 years 
48 + 	3 years 
 
(c)  Requirements to qualify for the incentive payment. 
(1)  The building must have been used last for commercial purposes and it must be redeveloped for a commercial purpose or new residential purpose. The building must be a minimum size of 30,000 heated square feet. 
(2)  The building must be located within the city. 
(3)  The building must be empty and/or vacant continuously for at least 24 months. 
(4)  A building can qualify only one time for the reimbursement incentive. The incentive will only be paid to the person or entity that redeveloped the empty building. 
(5)  The entire empty building must be fully occupied before the owner will qualify for the incentive. For purposes of this section, 75 percent or more of the heated square footage of the building must be utilized by the owner or tenant before qualifying for the incentive. 
(6)  The incentive cannot be taken in conjunction with the Downtown Aiken Facade Incentive Program. 
(7)  The owner shall apply for qualification for this incentive prior to the issuance of a building permit or demolition of the subject structure. 
(8)  The owner/developer must not have received any incentive payments or loans from the Aiken Corporation for use on the subject property.

Sec. 10-11. - Nuisances. 
Declaration of policy.

j.  A dwelling or other building which are dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the occupants of such dwellings, the occupants of neighboring dwellings, or other residents in the city. Such conditions may include the following (without limiting the generality foregoing): defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities; lack of adequate ventilation, light or sanitary facilities; dilapidation; disrepair; structural defects; uncleanliness; partial destruction. 
(2)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section the following terms are defined as follows: 
Buildings shall mean any structure which is used or intended to be used by humans but not specifically included in the term "dwellings." Nothing in this article shall be construed to apply to those buildings used primarily in an agriculturally related manner. 
Dwelling shall mean any dwelling or structure, or part thereof; used and occupied for human habitation or intended to be so used and includes any outhouses and appurtenances belonging thereto or usually enjoyed therewith.

Parties in interest shall mean all individuals, associations, corporations, and others who have interest of record in a dwelling or building and any who are in possession thereof. 
Residential area is defined as property developed primarily for residential use. 
Suspended construction shall mean that construction of an unfinished structure has ceased and that no good faith effort has been made to complete the construction. 
(3)  Standard. The standard for evaluation of nuisances for the implementation of this section shall be the latest revision of the International Property Maintenance Code except where its provisions conflict with other provisions of state law or city ordinance. 
(4)  Investigation by city staff. Whenever the city, through the building official or his designee becomes aware that there exists a situation which is harmful to the general health, safety, welfare or security of the community, the building official or his designee shall institute an investigation to determine if there is a reasonable basis for the complaint. The building official or his designee is authorized to request that other agencies or departments assist him in making such a determination. 
(5)  Warning. If city staff determines that a nuisance exists, and the nuisance is not an emergency situation and poses no threat of immediate danger, the city building official or his designee shall issue a formal written warning to the property owner or responsible party to abate the nuisance or correct the situation within 30 calendar days of the date of the warning. Notice shall be provided to the property owner or responsible party either personally or via U.S. First Class Mail to the address indicated in the tax assessor property records, or to the last known address. Only one warning shall be issued to an individual for any violation under chapter 10, section 10-11, nuisances, of the Aiken City Code of Ordinances. Second and subsequent offenses by the same individual for any alleged violation of this section will be immediately placed on a summons. 
(6)  Monitoring fees. If a party of interest has been previously issued a warning for a violation of this section, any subsequent violations in regard to any one or more lots, parcels or areas within the city, such party of interest shall be subject to a monitoring fee of fifty dollars for such administrative tasks as inspecting the property to determine compliance, determining ownership and preparing and mailing notices. This fee may be collected in the same manner as provided in subsection (11) of this section. 
(7)  Suspended construction projects. If any structure in the city becomes a nuisance due to suspended construction, the city may use the procedures in this ordinance to remedy any unsafe conditions caused by the unfinished structure and the suspended construction. All the applicable procedures set out in this section shall apply, but upon the building official's finding that construction has been suspended and that the unfinished structure and the suspended construction create conditions that are dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of neighboring residents or the general public or the safety of neighboring structures, the building official may order that construction resume or that the owner make the unfinished structure safe by boarding up the structure, removing construction debris and other safety hazards from the construction area, and otherwise removing or neutralizing health or safety hazards. If the owner fails to take the actions within ten days after being ordered to do so, the city may cause the unfinished structure to be boarded and the debris and other health and safety hazards removed or neutralized. The costs of doing so shall be assessed against the owner and may be collected as provided in subsection (11) of this section. 
(8)  Abatement agreements. The building official may enter into an abatement agreement with the property owner by which the city will agree to abate the nuisance subject to such terms and conditions as the building official deems appropriate. 
(9)  Summons to appear in municipal's court. If after a warning has been issued, the nuisance is not abated within the 30-day period, unless the delay is caused by another government agency, the building official may issue a summons to the property owner or responsible party to appear in municipal's court. If the building official determines that the nuisance cannot be abated within the 30-day period and the property owner has attempted to remedy the nuisance, the building official may extend the 30-day period an additional 30 days before issuing the summons. If the building official determines that the situation is an emergency or poses a threat of immediate danger, no warning is required, and the building official may immediately issue a summons or pursue any other available legal remedy. 
(10)  Alternative legal procedure. If city staff determines that the owner or other person responsible for the property on which the nuisance exists cannot be located or that the summons procedure is not appropriate for other reasons, then staff may request in writing that the building official request the city attorney or his designee to institute an action in the appropriate court, seeking injunctive relief requiring the person, persons or entities to abate the nuisance(s) or to cease and desist from the offending behavior. 
(11)  Abatement by city; lien. The building official may determine that the situation is so deleterious or injurious to the health, security, general welfare and safety of the city that he may request the city manager to approve the expenditure of funds to abate the nuisance. If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove, clean up, demolish, or abate the nuisance within the time frame defined by the building official, the city may cause such nuisance to be removed, cleaned up, demolished or otherwise abated. Any such public funds used to abate the nuisance shall be deemed to be a lien upon the real property upon which such costs were incurred, shall be recorded in the office of the registrar of mesne conveyance, and shall accrue interest at the rate set by statute for interest on judgments. 
If a structure is removed or demolished by the city, it shall sell the materials of such a structure and shall credit proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition and any balance shall be disbursed to the owner of the property. 
(12)  Emergency summary abatement procedure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, whenever the building official determines that a public nuisance exists within the city and that nuisance constitutes an imminent hazard or danger to public health or safety, the building official, without observing the provisions of this chapter with regard to abatement procedures, may take the following steps to abate the nuisance: 
a.  Give the property owner written notice by U.S. mail and, if reasonable under the circumstances, serve personal notice upon the property owner, of the public nuisance, the city's proposed timing and method of the abatement, and the city's intent to collect the abatement costs as lien against the property subject to collection as property taxes; 
b.  Following notice to the property owner, take all necessary and reasonable steps to cause the abatement of such nuisance in such manner as the building official determines is reasonably required; 
c.  Promptly report any such emergency abatement action to the city council; and 
d.  Cause to be maintained an itemized account of the costs incurred by the city in abating the imminently dangerous condition. Such costs may be recovered by the city in the same manner that abatement costs are recovered pursuant to subsection (11) of this section. 
(13)  Penalty. Any person, persons or entities violating any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be sentenced as follows: 
a.  For a first offense, by a fine of not less than $200.00 nor more than $300.00.

ARTICLE IV. - SMOKING REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 22-64. - Findings and determinations. 
The Aiken City Council ("council") hereby finds and determines: 
(1)  The City of Aiken, South Carolina ("city"), is an incorporated municipality located in Aiken County, South Carolina, and as such possesses all powers granted to municipalities by the Constitution and the laws of the State of South Carolina, including the powers enumerated in S.C. Code (2007 Supp.), § 5-7-30 relating to regulating streets, markets, and public health. 
(2)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to 65,000 americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10,"Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.). The surgeon general has declared that: 
a.  Secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmokers exposed to smoke; 
b.  Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for sudden death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma; 
c.  Adults exposed to secondary smoke have a higher risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer; 
d.  There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and 
e.  Separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does not sufficiently remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas. 
(3)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25 to 50 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study,"Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
(4)  Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking", Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(5)  The presence of secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces inevitably results in persons who do not smoke being forced to bear unwarranted health risks and inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of the premises to which they have been invited or permitted to enter, even when steps have been taken to separate "smoking" and "nonsmoking" areas within the confined space. 
(6)  The city recognizes that smoke creates a danger to the health and safety of the public at large and that, in order to protect the health and welfare of the public, it is necessary to restrict smoking in the manner provided for in this article ("article"). 
(Ord. No. 07142008C, § 1, 7-14-2008)  
Sec. 22-65. - Definitions.

The term "restaurant" shall include a bar area within the restaurant. 
Retail tobacco store means a retail store utilized primarily for the sale of tobacco products and accessories and in which the sale of other products is merely incidental. The term specifically includes cigar bars, which are establishments licensed for the on-premises sale of beer, wine, and alcoholic beverages as well as some food service, but the term does not include any establishment which is primarily a bar or restaurant and which undertakes to make retail offerings of tobacco products as a means of circumventing the purposes of this article. 
Second hand smoke means smoke emitted from lighted, smoldering, or burning tobacco when the person smoking is not inhaling, smoke emitted at the mouthpiece during puff drawing, and smoke exhaled by the person smoking. 
Service line means an indoor line in which one or more persons are waiting for or receiving service of any kind, whether or not the service involves the exchange of money.

No person shall place yard trash in front of, or on, property they do not own or lease from an owner. It shall be unlawful to place yard trash on, or within three feet of, the water meter, fire hydrant, or any other obstacle.

(13)  No other materials, refuse, garbage, or waste may be mixed with residential yard trash for pickup. Railroad ties, landscaping timbers, treated lumber, any construction debris, building materials, lumber, brick, dirt, shingles, or any other similar materials shall be removed by the property owner. Tenants and property owners must ensure that debris left by any contractor is removed and properly disposed, whether by contractors, property owners, or tenants. 
(14)  If prohibited items, or vegetative materials mixed with prohibited items, are placed at the curb, tenants or property owners will be charged double the special collection fees through the customers' water account. When there is no active water account the charges may be levied on the owners' property taxes.

Exhibit A 
 
Exhibit B 
NEWSRACK UNIT REGULATIONS: 
ALLOCATION OF NEWSRACK UNIT SPACES 
The total number of public spaces on the right of way or other city-owned property to be made available for modular newsracks in the central business district [as defined in section 36-12 of the Aiken City Code] shall be allocated by the following criteria: 
(1)  The City of Aiken will purchase and install modular newsracks for the locations originally approved by city council. The city will lease space on a bi-annual basis to publications originally approved by city council. There will be a minimum of 400 feet between each modular newsrack location which may be comprised of more than one modular newsrack. 
(2)  No later than May 15 of each year following the initial allocation of spaces, all publishers interested in leasing unoccupied modular newsrack space shall submit to the city manager a request identifying the number of spaces and locations requested. No later than June 1 of each year, the city manager shall designate the number of spaces, if any, a requesting publisher shall have at any location, effective July 1. The space so allocated, subject to the terms and conditions of these regulations, shall be held by the permittee for two consecutive fiscal years at a cost per year to be determined and based upon the actual cost to the city amortized over a five-year period. 
(3)  If all spaces at all locations are available to meet all publishers' requests as submitted, then the city manager's office shall issue space permits as requested. Before newsrack spaces are allocated, the publisher will agree to remove all of its personal newsracks from the central business district within ten days of receiving its space from the city. If the publisher does not remove its racks within this time, the city will be authorized to remove the racks. 
(4)  If there are insufficient spaces at a location to meet all new requests for available spaces as submitted, then the city manager's office shall allocate by lottery for the locations where there are insufficient spaces. 
(5)  All publishers failing to receive a space at a particular location shall be put on a waiting list for that location for the applicable year in the sequence their names were drawn for that location. If spaces at the location become available during the year, then they shall be made available to publishers in the sequence their names appear on the waiting list for the location. 
(6)  No publisher may utilize more than 50 percent of the available modular newsrack space at any one location unless there is a space not being utilized at the location, but each publisher may offer more than one publication in the spaces provided. 
(7)  Publishers not participating in the May 15 application, may be placed on the waiting list behind those already on the list and they shall be placed in the order their requests are received. 
(8)  A publication's permit for a modular newsrack space is not transferable. 
(9)  All publishers must keep stocked the modular newsrack spaces allocated to them. If the city checks randomly and finds a space not stocked two out of four times over a four week period, the occupancy can be terminated, provided there is a publisher on the waiting list for the location. The city must keep the modular newsracks in good working order and good appearance. 
(10)  In the event a publisher desires to utilize a coin operated device for the purpose of collecting money for their publication, the publisher will be responsible for procuring the coin operated device and will be responsible for the upkeep, maintenance and repair of these coin operated devices. 
(11)  The city manager shall have the ability to amend these regulations from time to time with a minimum of 15 days written notice to all tenants.

Sec. 38-8. - Special real property tax assessments for rehabilitated historic properties. 
A special tax assessment is created for eligible rehabilitated historic properties for ten years equal to the appraised value of the property at the time of preliminary certification. Where there is a conflict between provisions of this section and the enabling state code, the more restrictive provision shall control. 
(1)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to: 
a.  Encourage the restoration of historic properties; 
b.  Promote community development and redevelopment; 
c.  Encourage sound community planning; and 
d.  Promote the general health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
(2)  Eligible properties. 
a.  Certification. In order to be eligible for the special tax assessment, historic properties must receive preliminary and final certification. 
1.  To receive preliminary certification a property must meet the following conditions: 
(i)  The property has received historic designation. 
(ii)  The proposed rehabilitation work receives approval from the design review board (DRB). 
(iii)  Be a project that commenced by or after August 17, 2004 to the date of the adoption of this section and work was permitted to have begun prior to receiving preliminary certification; or 
(iv)  Be a project that commences on or after the date of the adoption of this section. Preliminary certification must be received prior to beginning work. 
2.  To receive final certification, a property must have met the following conditions: 
(i)  The property has received preliminary certification. 
(ii)  The minimum expenditures for rehabilitation were incurred and paid. 
(iii)  The completed rehabilitation receives approval from the DRB as being consistent with the plans approved by DRB as part of preliminary certification. 
b.  Historic designation. As used in this section, "historic designation" means the property maintains one or more of the following: 
1.  The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places either individually or as a contributing property in a district. 
2.  The property is at least 50 years old and is an individual landmark or a contributing property in a local district as designated by city council and listed as so designated in the city Code. 
(3)  Eligible rehabilitation. 
a.  Standards for rehabilitation work. To be eligible for the special tax assessment, historic rehabilitations must be appropriate for the historic building and the historic district in which it is located. This is achieved through adherence to the following standards: 
1.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved; the removal of historic materials or alterations of features that characterize each property shall be avoided. 
2.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use; changes that create a false sense of historical development shall not be undertaken. 
3.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
4.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved. 
5.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced; where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new should match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials; replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
6.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used; the surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
7.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property; the new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the historic property and its environment. 
8.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
b.  Work to be reviewed for preliminary and final certification. The following work will be reviewed according to the standards set forth above: 
1.  Repairs to the exterior of the designated building. 
2.  Alterations to the exterior of the designated building. 
3.  New construction on the property on which the building is located. 
4.  Any remaining work, including interior work, where the expenditures for such work are being used to satisfy the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation. 
c.  Minimum expenditures for rehabilitation means the owner or the owner's estate rehabilitates the building, with expenditures for rehabilitation exceeding 20 percent of the fair market value of the building. Fair market value means the appraised value as certified to the DRB by a real estate appraiser licensed by the state, the sales price as delineated in a bona fide contract of sale within 12 months of the time it is submitted, or the most recent appraised value published by the county tax assessor. 
d.  Expenditures for rehabilitation means the actual cost of rehabilitation relating to one or more of the following: 
1.  Improvements located on or within the historic building as designated. 
2.  Improvements outside of but directly attached to the historic building which make possible an efficient contemporary use while preserving those portions and features of the building(s) that are significant to its historic, architectural, and cultural values. Costs associated with new structures, or the addition of rentable/habitable floor space not attributed to efficient contemporary use of space within an existing historic structure shall not be included in the calculation of eligible costs. 
3.  Architectural and engineering services attributable to the design of the improvements. 
4.  Costs necessary to maintain the historic character or integrity of the building. 
e.  Scope. The special tax assessment may apply to the following: 
1.  Structure(s) rehabilitated. 
2.  Real property on which the building is located. 
f.  Time limits. To be eligible for the special tax assessment, rehabilitation must be completed within two years of the preliminary certification date. If the project is not complete after two years, but the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation have been incurred, the property continues to receive the special assessment until the project is completed or until the end of the special assessment period, whichever shall first occur. 
(4)  Process. 
a.  Fee required. There is a fee of $150.00 required for final certification for each application for review of rehabilitation work of single-family and/or duplex structures and $300.00 for all other structures. Fees are payable to the city, and final certification will not be given without payment of this fee. 
b.  Plan required. Owners of property seeking to receive the special tax assessment must submit an application, provided by the planning department, with all supporting documentation and application fee in order to be considered for preliminary certification. This should be submitted before work is begun. However, work completed within the preceding 12 months may be considered at the discretion of the board. 
c.  Preliminary certification. Upon receipt of the completed application, the proposal shall be placed on the next available agenda of the DRB to determine if the project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation in subsection 38-8(3)a. above. After the DRB makes its determination, the owner shall be notified in writing. Upon receipt of this determination the owner may: 
1.  If the application is approved, begin rehabilitation; 
2.  If the application is not approved, he may revise such application in accordance with comments provided by the DRB; 
d.  Substantive changes. Once preliminary certification is granted to an application, substantive changes must be approved by the DRB. Unapproved substantive changes are conducted at the risk of the property owner and may disqualify the project from eligibility. Additional expenditures will not qualify the project for an extension on the special assessment. 
e.  Final certification. Upon completion of the project, the project must receive final certification in order to be eligible for the special assessment. The DRB will inspect completed projects to determine if the work is consistent with the approval granted by the DRB pursuant to section 38-8. Final certification will be granted when the completed work meets the standards and verification is made that expenditures have been made in accordance with subsection 38-8(3)c and d. above. Upon receiving final certification, the property will be assessed for the remainder of the special assessment period on the fair market value of the property at the time the preliminary certification was made or the final certification was made, whichever occurred earlier. 
f.  Additional work. Subsection 1 below shall apply to all properties receiving final certification after (date of city council adoption). Properties receiving final certification before this date shall be subject to subsection 2 below. 
1.  All additional work on the exterior of the property shall be subject to design review via the established certificate of appropriateness process and approval matrix. Furthermore, at the time of final certification, the design review board may establish a "preservation zone" to identify critical architectural and historically significant elements that should be preserved. This preservation zone may include interior rooms and elements, as well as exterior elements that would not otherwise be subject to design review through the certificate of appropriateness process. For the remainder of the special assessment period after final certification, any additional work (repair, replacement, modification) to the preservation zone elements identified shall be subject to review by the design review board through the certificate of appropriateness process to ensure that all work is consistent with relevant design and preservation guidelines as adopted per section 5.2.3.J of the zoning ordinance, and the standards for rehabilitation work provided in this section. If the additional work is found to be inconsistent with these guidelines, the property owner may withdraw his request and cancel or revise the proposed additional work. The design review board may designate review and approval authority to the planning director and design review board chair. 
2.  Current owners of participating properties receiving final certification before September 23, 2019 shall, upon adoption of this ordinance by city council, be given by staff the following implementation options applicable for the remainder of their assessment period: 
(i)  For the remainder of the special assessment period after final certification, the property owner shall notify the DRB of any additional work, other than ordinary maintenance. The DRB will review the work at a regularly scheduled hearing and determine whether the overall project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation. If the additional work is found to be inconsistent the property owner may withdraw his request and cancel or revise the proposed additional work. 
(ii)  Participating properties shall be subject to the policy established in subsection 1 after a site visit and hearing by the board to establish a "preservation zone" for the property. 
g.  Decertification. When the property has received final certification and has been assessed as rehabilitated historic property, it remains so certified and must be granted the special assessment until the property becomes disqualified by any one of the following: 
1.  Written notice from the owner to the DRB and the auditor requesting removal of the preferential assessment; 
2.  Removal of the historic designation by the city council; or 
3.  Rescission of the approval of rehabilitation by the DRB because of alterations or renovation by the owner or the owner's estate which causes the property to no longer possess the qualities and features which made it eligible for final certification. 
Notification of any change affecting eligibility must be given immediately to the county assessor, auditor, and treasurer. Under no circumstances shall the sale or transfer of ownership of real property certified and assessed in accordance with this section and any ordinance in effect at the time disqualify the property from receiving the special property tax assessment under this section. This provision shall be applicable and given full force and effect to any special property tax assessment granted prior to the effective date of this paragraph notwithstanding any ordinance in effect from time to time to the contrary. 
h.  Notification. The city shall, upon final certification of a property, notify the county assessor, auditor and treasurer that such property has been duly certified and is eligible for the special tax assessment. 
i.  Date effective. If an application for preliminary or final certification is filed by May 1 or the preliminary or final certification is approved by August 1, the special assessment authorized herein is effective for that year. Otherwise, it is effective beginning with the following year. 
The special assessment only begins in the current or future tax years as provided for in this section. In no instance may the special assessment be applied retroactively. 
j.  Application. Once the DRB has granted the special property tax assessments authorized herein, the owner of the property shall make application to the county auditor and other appropriate county offices at the directive of county officials for the special assessment provided for herein.

(f)  The following remedies for inadequate service or for interruption of service are hereby established: 
(1)  In the event that service to any subscriber is interrupted, except for natural disasters, and except in circumstances for which approval of the interruption is obtained from the agency, a grantee shall provide credit on or reimbursement of the monthly fees (basic, special, or premium service) to the subscriber on a pro rata basis for any interruption in cable services if the subscriber has made a complaint to the grantee or requested credit or reimbursement. If the service interruption continues for more than 12 hours and less than 24 hours on any day or portion of a day, then the customer shall be entitled to a full day credit for each such 12- to 24-hour period. 
(2)  In the event that degraded reception, i.e. poor quality reception, is the result of technical deficiency of the system and not caused by the equipment of the subscriber or user, or abuse of the grantee's equipment by the subscriber or user, the grantee shall credit the subscriber for the monthly fees (basic, special, or premium service) on a pro rata basis for any degraded reception quality if the subscriber has made a complaint to the grantee or requested a credit. If degraded reception quality continues for more than 12 hours and less than 24 hours on any day or portion of a day, then the customer shall be entitled to a full day credit for each such 12- to 24-hour period. 
(3)  In the event that the grantee's system fails to meet one or more of the operational standards detailed in the franchise agreement of this chapter, and for which a performance test has been requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, for a full three-month period, grantee shall reduce fees to all subscribers by 25 percent until all operational standards are met. The agency's notification to conduct performance tests pursuant to subsection (d) of this section shall be the date upon which the three-month period commences.

Sec. 40-12. - Inspection of property and records. 
(a)  Grantee shall at all reasonable times, and to the extent necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter, permit any duly authorized agent or representative of the franchise entity to examine all franchise property of grantee, together with any appurtenant property of grantee situated within or without the franchise entity, and to examine and transcribe any and all maps and other records kept or maintained by grantee or under the control or direction or at the request of grantee which pertain in any way to the franchise operations, affairs, transactions, or property of grantee. 
(b)  Any of such map or other records which are not situated within the franchise entity and which are not made available in the franchise entity within a reasonable time after written request therefor by the agency or the franchise entity's attorney, shall be produced for examination wherever the map or other records shall be situated, and grantee shall pay all travel and other expenses necessarily or reasonably incurred by the franchise entity, its agents, and representatives in making such examination. 
(c)  Grantee shall prepare and furnish to the agency, at such times and in such form as prescribed by the agency, references, and materials relating to the operations, affairs, transactions, or property of grantee as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of the duties of the agency or franchise authority.

(Code 1980, § 6.5-12)  
Sec. 40-13. - Conditions on street occupancy. 
(a)  Any pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other area taken up or disturbed or any excavations made by a grantee shall be done under the supervision or direction of the authority responsible for the maintenance of the street or public place or facilities involved and shall be done in such a manner the least inconvenient to the inhabitants of the franchise entity, users of the streets, places, and facilities and adjoining property owners. A grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, and in a manner approved by the agency or other authority, replace, repair, and restore any such pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved areas in as good a condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done, and shall also make and keep full and complete plats, maps, and records showing the exact locations of its facilities located within the streets, public places, and easements of the franchise entity. These maps shall be available for inspection at any time during business hours by the agency. 
(b)  A grantee shall at its expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove, any of its property located in, under, on or over the streets and other public places or facilities of the franchise entity when required by the franchise authority or agency by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, road construction, change of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of municipal improvements or operations; provided, however, that the grantee shall, in all cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place. 
(c)  A grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the franchise entity, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than 96 hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(d)  Grantee shall make use of existing poles and other facilities available to it to the maximum extent feasible. 
(e)  Subject to prior approval by the city horticulturist, a grantee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging streets, but only to the minimum extent feasible to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the grantee, except that, at the option of the city horticulturist, such trimming may be done by it or under its supervision and direction at the expense of the grantee. In case of an emergency, prior approval of the city horticulturist is not required. 
(f)  In all sections of the franchise area where cable, wires or other similar facilities of public utilities are placed underground, the grantee shall place its cables, wires or other like facilities, whether existing or not, underground to the maximum extent that existing technology reasonably permits the grantee to do so. To the extent existing technology does not permit underground placement, the facilities may be placed above ground but must be of such size, design and location as not to be unsightly or unsafe. 
(g)  Notwithstanding the grant to use streets, no street shall be used by grantee if the franchise authority determines that such use is inconsistent with the terms, conditions or provisions by which such street was created, or dedicated, is inconsistent with how the street is properly used by the franchise entity or public, or creates a public safety hazard. 
(h)  Nothing in a franchise agreement or this chapter shall be deemed to compel the franchise entity to maintain or retain any of its property any longer than or in any fashion other than, in its discretion, its own operations or needs may require. 
(i)  The franchise entity shall not be required to assume any responsibility for securing any rights-of-way or easements for grantee, nor shall it be responsible for securing for grantee any permits or agreements with other persons or utilities.

(a)  A grantee shall extend the installation of cables, amplifiers, and related equipment and facilities throughout the area covered by its franchise as rapidly as practicable, but, in any event, shall: 
(1)  Begin engineering studies within 30 days after accepting its franchise. 
(2)  Begin awarding contracts within 90 days after receiving certification from the FCC. 
(3)  Begin construction of its proposed system within six months after receiving certification from the FCC. 
(4)  Begin rendering service to subscribers within one year of franchise award from the franchise entity. 
(5)  Complete construction of 50 percent of its proposed system (measured in terms of total linear strand miles) within two years after receiving certification from the FCC and complete an additional 25 percent each year thereafter so that after four years the entire system shall be constructed and the grantee capable of providing service no more than 60 days after receiving an application for service to every household within the franchise area. 
(6)  File a map and progress report with the agency at the close of each calendar year showing the exact areas of the franchise entity being services by the cable television system and lines. 
(b)  Failure on the part of a grantee to commence and diligently pursue each of the requirements of this section and to complete each of the matters set forth in this section shall be grounds for revocation of its franchise pursuant to the terms of section 40-5, provided, however, that the franchise authority may in its discretion extend the time for the commencement and completion of construction and installation for additional periods in the event that grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reasons of circumstances beyond its control. 
(c)  In the event the operation of any part of a cable television system is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the event a system has been installed in any public street without complying with requirements of the grantee's franchise, the grantee shall promptly, upon being given ten days' notice by the franchise authority or agency, remove from the streets or public places at its own expense all such property and poles of such system. Any property which the grantee allows to remain in place 60 days after having been notified by the franchise authority or agency that it must be removed shall be considered permanently abandoned and shall become the property of the franchise entity subject to the provisions of any utility joint use attachment agreement. 
(d)  Upon the failure of grantee to satisfactorily complete any work upon the public streets as may be required by this chapter or the terms of its franchise agreement within the time prescribed, the franchise authority or agency, at its option, may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall pay the franchise entity the cost thereof within 30 days after receipt of any itemized statement therefor. 
(e)  In the case of a franchise renewal, the franchise agreement or other document containing the terms of the renewal shall set forth the obligations of the grantee to extend, improve, or upgrade its services, equipment, and facilities.

Cross reference Buildings and building regulations, ch. 10.  
Sec. 40-15. - Performance and construction bond. 
(a)  Concurrently with the acceptance of its franchise, a grantee shall file with the agency a permanent payment and performance bond, with surety acceptable to the franchise authority, in an amount determined by section 40-16 to indemnify the franchise entity against any losses it may suffer if the grantee fails to comply with one or more of the provisions of this chapter or its franchise. The bond shall be obtained at the sole expense of the grantee and shall be upgraded in the event the number of subscribers increase such that it would place the cable television system in a higher subscriber range and would therefore increase the amount of the bond. A bond set as prescribed in this section shall remain in effect for the full term of the franchise or any renewal thereof plus an additional six months thereafter. For an existing cable television system operating satisfactorily under a current franchise within the franchise entity for a period of three or more years, the franchise authority may modify or waive the performance bond in its discretion by resolution. The grantee and its surety shall be jointly and severally liable under the terms of the bond for any damage or loss suffered by the franchise entity as a result of the grantee's nonperformance, including default, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. The bond shall provide for 30 days prior written notice to the agency of any intention on the part of the grantee or surety to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise materially alter its terms. Neither the filing of an indemnity bond with the agency, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the franchise authority thereunder shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee under the terms of this chapter or its franchise for damages either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. 
(b)  Within 30 days after the award of a franchise, grantee shall file with the agency a construction bond with a surety acceptable to the franchise authority or agency, or cash in lieu of a bond, in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated system construction cost, to indemnify the franchise entity against any losses it may suffer in the event the grantee fails to complete on time each construction phase of the system. The bond shall be obtained at the sole expense of the grantee and remain in effect for the time of construction. The bond shall be reduced by the franchise authority or agency in increments to be based upon the timely completion of each phase of system following approval by the agency. A grantee that has completed primary construction and is extending the system into new service areas of the franchise entity shall provide a construction bond each year in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated cost of all proposed cable system construction by the grantee during such year. The grantee shall provide a certificate to the agency by January 1 of each year estimating the costs of all projected construction during such year and shall provide the construction bond within 30 days after submitting the certificate. The franchise authority agrees to sign any documentation required by the grantee in order to release any construction bond, provided that an appropriate replacement bond, if required, will be provided to the franchise entity. The grantee and its surety shall be jointly and severally liable under the terms of the bond for any damages suffered by the franchise entity as a result of the grantee's nonperformance, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost to cure, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. The bond shall provide for 30 days' prior written notice to the agency of any intention on the part of the grantee or surety to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise materially alter its terms. Neither the filing of any indemnity bond with the agency, nor the receipt of any damages by the franchise authority thereunder shall be construed to excuse faithful performance and timely construction by the grantee, or limit the liability of the grantee under the terms of this chapter or its franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. 
(Code 1980, § 6.5-15)  
Sec. 40-16. - Performance and payment bond schedule.

(Code 1980, § 6.5-16)  
Sec. 40-17. - Franchise fee payments. 
(a)  Any person awarded a franchise under this chapter shall pay the franchise entity each year during the term of the franchise a franchise fee in a percentage amount, which shall not exceed the maximum permitted by applicable federal and state laws and which shall be specified in the franchise agreement between the franchise entity and the grantee, of its annual gross revenues derived from its operation of the cable communications system within the franchise area. The fee shall be paid to the franchise entity on a quarterly basis by the grantee pursuant to terms specified in the franchise agreement. 
(b)  A grantee shall file with the agency, within 90 days after expiration of any calendar year or portion thereof during which its franchise is in force, a financial statement certified by a responsible officer of the grantee, reporting in detail the gross revenues, as defined in this chapter, of the grantee during the preceding calendar year or portion thereof. It shall be the duty of the grantee to pay the franchise entity within 15 days after the time for filing such statement any unpaid balance thereof for the calendar year covered by such statement. If an overpayment has been made, it shall be credited against the franchise fee for the succeeding year. 
(c)  The franchise entity shall have the right to inspect the grantee's records showing the gross revenues from which its franchise payments are computed and shall also have the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid or due under this chapter or the franchise agreement. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the franchise entity may have for further or additional sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation under this chapter. However, an accounting rendered to the franchise entity and to which no exception is made within three years after receipt by the franchise entity shall be deemed to be accurate and shall not thereafter be subject to question or made the basis of any claim by the franchise entity against grantee. 
(d)  Interest to be charged the grantee for late payment of franchise fees shall be specified in the franchise agreement. 
(Code 1980, § 6.5-17)  
Sec. 40-18. - Rates charged to subscribers. 
(a)  A grantee's rate structure must be uniform throughout the franchise area. No rate established by a grantee shall afford any undue preference or advantage among subscribers. 
(b)  Grantee shall, at all times, keep on file and maintain with the agency and in its local business office a complete information tariff containing schedules of all charges, rates, and fees charged by grantee to all classes of its subscribers, together with any amendments thereto. 
(c)  No rate shall be increased unless a grantee provides notice thereof to subscribers 45 days prior to the effective date of the increase. 
(d)  The franchise authority expressly reserves the right at its discretion to review, regulate and/or approve the rates which a grantee charges its subscribers for such services as it may be permitted to regulate by existing or subsequent federal or state laws or regulations; provided, however, that such right of the franchise authority may be exercised only by affirmative action of the franchise authority after a duly noticed public hearing. A grantee shall not deny, delay, interrupt, or terminate cable service or the use of community communications facilities to subscribers because the franchise authority denies a request for a rate increase; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit a grantee's right to seek judicial review of the reasonableness of any such action. 
(e)  No rate, fee or charge of any kind, which is within the approval authority of the franchise entity as set forth in subsection (d) of this section, shall be charged or collected from subscribers by the grantee without authorization by the franchise authority. 
(f)  A grantee may request rate increases or decreases at any time in accordance with this section; provided, however, that initial rates to be charged and collected by a new grantee from subscribers shall be established in the agreement granting a franchise; provided further, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the first renewal of a franchise in existence on the effective date of this chapter. 
(g)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a grantee from reducing or waiving charges in conjunction with bona fide promotional campaigns for the purpose of attracting subscribers or users. 
(Code 1980, § 6.5-18)  
Sec. 40-19. - Termination of service. 
(a)  Upon termination of service to any subscriber, a grantee shall promptly remove all its facilities and equipment from the subscriber's premises upon the subscriber's request. 
(b)  If a grantee terminates services to a subscriber of less than the three years without good cause or because the grantee ceases to operate a system authorized hereunder for any reason, except expiration of a franchise granted hereunder, the grantee shall refund to such subscriber that portion of the initial tap-in and connection charge paid by the subscriber representing the unused remainder of the three-year period, determined by prorating the date of notice of terminate on a month-unit basis. 
(c)  No subscriber's service may be terminated for nonpayment of charges unless the subscriber is provided ten days' written notice prior to such termination. 
(Code 1980, § 6.5-19)  
Sec. 40-20. - Public service requirements. 
A grantee shall: 
(1)  Provide at least one service outlet to all franchise entity facilities and all public schools within its franchise area which are located within 300 feet of grantee's lines at no cost to the franchise entity or school involved, and shall charge only its time and material costs for any other service outlets to such facilities. There shall be no charge for basic cable service for one outlet for each such location. 
(2)  Provide at least one channel, without charges or restrictions, for use by the franchise entity. 
(3)  Provide at least one channel for educational and public access uses.

The franchise authority may amend this chapter, and any franchise issued hereunder, upon its own motion or the application of a grantee whenever amendment is necessary to enable the grantee to utilize new development in television or radio signal transmission which would improve and update cable television service in the franchise area. No amendment shall be adopted except after a public hearing, and no amendment substantially amending the existing rights and obligations of the grantee or franchise entity shall be adopted without its consent, unless otherwise required by federal or state laws or regulations. 
(Code 1980, § 6.5-21)  
Sec. 40-22. - Application procedures.

The franchise authority shall have 30 days from receipt of the agreement to notify the grantee in writing that it will purchase the system on the same terms. If it does not so notify the grantee, the first right of refusal shall terminate.

Sec. 40-31. - Annexed areas. 
(a)  If the franchise authority annexes an area, and if a grantee has an existing franchise for the entire corporate limits of the franchise entity, the grantee on its own initiative may submit, or after receiving a written request from the franchise authority 60 days prior thereto shall submit a plan and schedule for providing cable communications service to the annexed area as soon as practical.

(c)  If a grantee already is serving an area annexed by the franchise authority, it may continue to serve the area after annexation subject to approval by the franchise authority and amendment of the franchise agreement to include the annexed area, if necessary.

Editor's note Ord. No. 10252004A, § 1, adopted Oct. 25, 2004, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 11-111-6. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 42-17642-181. 
 
Sec. 42-176. - Purpose and administration. 
(a)  The purpose of this article shall be to maintain at least a level of service D at roadway intersections or to maintain operations at a level of service and delay better than or equivalent to current conditions if the intersection operates at level of service E or F today, by requiring the preparation of a traffic impact analysis study to determine the impact and improvements necessary to the transportation system in conjunction with certain development requests. Where required by section 42-178, a traffic impact analysis study shall be submitted as part of any request for approval of a site plan change, an annexation, a rezoning to a category that allows more intense uses than currently allowed on the site, a major subdivision, a concept plan for a tract zoned commercial or planned unit development, or a request for city services except where the subject property is already developed and no redevelopment is proposed. This article shall apply to any new development or change to an existing site. 
(b)  The planning director shall administer this article. 
(Ord. No. 10252004A, § 1, Exh. A, 10-25-2004; Ord. No. 02102020 B, § 1(Exh. A), 2-10-2020)  
Sec. 42-177. - Standards. 
(a)  For the purpose of monitoring the operations of the significant intersections of the transportation network, the planning director shall prepare and update at least every two years by November 1 an official AM and PM peak hour transportation analysis and associated map listing current intersection levels of service. The significant intersections in the city limits and in the utility service area outside of the city limits will be determined prior to the commencement of the traffic analysis. 
(b)  Except as stated below, the level of service for a particular intersection shall be determined using a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes and capacity analysis methodologies based on the Transportation Research Board's 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) or latest edition. 
(Ord. No. 10252004A, § 1, Exh. A, 10-25-2004; Ord. No. 11122007A, § 1, 11-12-2007; Ord. No. 02102020 B, § 1(Exh. A), 2-10-2020)  
Sec. 42-178. - Criteria for determining when a traffic impact analysis study is required. 
(a)  A traffic impact analysis study will be required for new developments when the proposed development is projected to generate 100 or more trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator or the peak hour of the adjacent street traffic (7:009:00 a.m. or 4:006:00 p.m.). Proposed developments that do not meet this threshold may also be required to complete a traffic study as determined by the planning director. 
(b)  A study will be required for a change or expansion at an existing site that results in an expected increase of 100 or more trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator or the peak hour of the adjacent street traffic (7:009:00 a.m. or 4:006:00 p.m.), or if the planning director determines that the change or expansion of the existing site will have significant impact at the existing access points, proposed access points, or surrounding intersections. 
(c)  The estimate of the number of trips generated by proposed developments will be based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 10 th Edition, or latest edition. Other trip generation data collected locally may be used where approved by the planning director. 
(Ord. No. 10252004, § 1, Exh. A, 10-25-2004; Ord. No. 11122007A, § 1, 11-12-2007; Ord. No. 02102020 B, § 1(Exh. A), 2-10-2020)  
Sec. 42-179. - Traffic impact analysis study requirements. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  A traffic impact analysis study must be prepared, signed, and sealed by a qualified traffic engineering consultant registered in the State of South Carolina. The planning director shall maintain a list of consultants preapproved to prepare a study and shall develop, publish, and maintain a policy for the selection of firms to be on the list. A qualified firm may be added to the list of approved consultants by submitting a qualifications package for approval by the planning director. 
(2)  The planning director will establish the scope of the traffic impact analysis study based on the intensity of the proposed use and the location of the project. At a minimum, the proposed site access points will be studied, and signalized intersection(s) adjacent to the proposed site driveways should be given consideration for inclusion in the study area. The study area shall be confirmed with planning director prior to commencement of the study. 
(3)  A traffic impact analysis study shall be prepared in accordance with SCDOT standards. 
(4)  A methodology memo shall be submitted prior to commencement of the traffic impact analysis study for approval by the planning director. 
(5)  Trip generation estimates shall be based upon methods provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 10 th Edition, or latest revision. Other trip generation data collected locally may be used where approved by the planning director. 
(6)  Capacity and level of service analysis methodologies shall be based upon the Transportation Research Board's 2010 HCM, or its most recent revision. 
(7)  Intersection capacity analysis should be performed using Synchro, Version 10 or SIDRA, Version 8 or similar, as appropriate. 
(8)  The traffic impact analysis study shall assess the a.m. and p.m. peak hours and other hours, where deemed necessary by the planning director, for land uses that may generate high traffic volumes on weekends or at midday or nighttime periods. 
(9)  A study prepared in conjunction with a request for annexation or rezoning shall be based on the most intense development allowed by the proposed zoning, unless the owner of the property voluntarily agrees to limit the intensity of development on the entire tract of property. The owner must file a valid restrictive covenant with the Aiken County RMC Office which will forever limit the intensity of development on the property in a manner that is satisfactory to the planning director and/or the city attorney and must provide proof of filing to the planning director before the annexation or rezoning is complete. If as a result of the voluntary restriction, the net new trips shall be less than noted in section 42-178(a), a study may not be required; however a study of any access points for the proposed development shall be required. 
If the subsequent development on the property is less intense than the current use or the use on which an initial study was based, a revised study may be submitted to show expected net new trips are below the threshold noted in section 42-178(a). 
(10)  The planning director shall establish, publish and update, as needed, guidelines for applicants explaining requirements for the content, format and presentation of a study and the number of copies to be submitted. 
(11)  The city shall provide any relevant publicly available traffic count data in its possession within five business days of a request by the applicant. 
(12)  Traffic counts may be used if collected within 12 months of submittal of the study. Counts shall be collected when K-12 schools are in session unless otherwise approved by the planning director. 
(13)  If a traffic signal is being proposed, a signal warrant analysis shall be included in the study. The approval of a traffic signal on projected volumes may be deferred until volumes meet warrants given in the most recent version of the FHWA's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). 
(b)  Study area and contents. 
(1)  The study area for the traffic impact analysis shall include the proposed site access points, signalized intersections immediately adjacent to the development, and additional intersections identified by the planning director. If intersections impacted by the development are within a coordinated traffic system, at least the two adjacent signalized intersections on the coordinated system should be analyzed, and analysis of the whole coordinated system should be considered by the planning director for inclusion in the study. Existing signal timings should be used for all signalized intersections in the existing conditions analysis. 
(2)  Contents of study. 
a.  Study area descriptions, roadway classifications, other projected transportation improvements and other approved developments in the study area shall be included in the study. 
b.  Assessment of existing conditions, future no build conditions, and future conditions at full buildout shall be provided. Phasing of future build conditions may be performed. If project is planned to be phased, no build conditions should be included for each phase. 
c.  Assessment of a.m. and p.m. peak hour conditions plus any other hours specified by the planning director shall be provided. 
d.  A mitigation plan for intersection and roadway segment improvements should be developed where analysis shows level of service is E or F during any study hour, to ensure level of service D or better for all study hours at signalized intersections. If an intersection currently operates at LOS E or F, a mitigation plan should be developed to ensure that the future LOS and delay are equivalent to or better than existing conditions. Mitigation plans for unsignalized intersections where analysis shows level of service is E or F for any study hour may be required. 
e.  Discussion of access point coordination with SCDOT for access points on SCDOT roadways will be required. 
f.  A vicinity map at a scale sufficient to identify the location of the project shall be provided. 
g.  A site plan with development plans at a scale of not less than 1 inch = 100 feet shall be provided. 
h.  Study shall note intensities for all project phases along with the buildout year with trip generation and distribution displayed in tabular or graphic format. 
i.  Existing, future no build and full buildout levels of service for access points and study area intersections should be summarized in tabular format (including phases as appropriate.) 
j.  Traffic flow diagrams showing existing, background and total future trips (including phases as appropriate) shall be provided. 
k.  All recommended improvements shall be presented in tabular and/or graphic format. 
(Ord. No. 10252004A, § 1, Exh. A, 10-25-2004; Ord. No. 11122007A, § 1, 11-12-2007; Ord. No. 02102020 B, § 1(Exh. A), 2-10-2020)  
Sec. 42-180. - Use of the traffic impact analysis study. 
(a)  The city will notify the applicant within ten business days of submission if any required components of a study have been omitted or provide technical comments to applicant. Once comments have been received and addressed applicant can resubmit study for rereview. The city will notify the applicant within 15 business days of a complete submission as to additional comments, approval or disapproval of a study. 
(b)  The planning director shall only grant approval if the level of service at all studied signalized intersections is D or better; or, for intersections currently operating at LOS E or F, if the level of service and delay are equivalent to or better than existing conditions. Any such application for which the traffic impact analysis study shows a level of service worse than a D at a signalized intersection or not operating better than current level of service E or F conditions shall be referred to the planning director for a final determination. Unsignalized intersections performing at a level of service worse than a D may be approved, denied, or deferred at the discretion of the planning director. 
(c)  The applicant will pay for all of the cost of any necessary roadway, traffic control, or access improvements as a result of the project. The applicant must construct the improvements or changes or post a performance guarantee with the city to cover the cost of their construction prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Any posted performance guarantee shall be in an amount of 150 percent of the estimated construction cost of the project for a term of one year and may be in the form of cash, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a bond acceptable to the city. Such improvements may include, but are not limited to, installation of travel lanes, installation of turn lanes, installation of or modifications to traffic signals, and relocation or consolidation of driveways. 
(d)  All improvements on state roadways shall be coordinated with SCDOT. SCDOT may require additional improvements beyond those required by the city. A SCDOT encroachment permit will be required as part of the building permit process. 
(e)  Approval of a study will expire after two years unless a building permit is obtained for the project and construction begins.

Sec. 44-89. - Agreements for acceptance of industrial waste for pretreatment. 
No statement contained in this division shall be construed as preventing any agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern. The basis for sewer surcharges is set out in section 44-90. 
(Code 1980, § 25-60)  
Sec. 44-90. - Surcharges. 
In Table I, a schedule of surcharges has been established which takes into consideration the total costs for the treatment of waste. This schedule (Table I) can be amended from time to time by ordinance of the city council. In this schedule, a BOD 5 concentration of 0 to 600 ppm and a pH in the range of 6.0 through 11.0 pH units is considered to be standard sewage waste. Any sewage having a concentration in excess of 600 ppm BOD 5 , or having a pH of less than 6.0 units or greater than 11.0 units is subject to a surcharge in accordance with the schedule set forth in Table I. This surcharge schedule is based on the equitable recovery of waste treatment costs as required for those cities receiving federal assistance for the construction of wastewater treatment facilities and is in compliance with the regulations in 18 CFR 601.34. The issuance of this surcharge schedule does not in itself permit nor does it imply that any such waste will be received by the city for treatment. In each instance the actual acceptance of the waste for treatment is subject to review and evaluation by the city. In some instances, pretreatment may be required before acceptance of the waste for final treatment by the city.

ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR ILLICIT DISCHARGES OR CONNECTIONS 
 
Sec. 44-192. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
(2)  To ensure the proper installation, operation, and maintenance of construction site best management practices (BMPs). 
(3)  To establish legal authority to carry out all procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.

Chapter 45 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), adopted May 14, 2018, repealed the former Ch. 45, §§ 45-145-64, and enacted a new Ch. 45 as set out herein. The former Ch. 45 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 11242008, § 1(Exh. A), 11-24-2008. 
 
ARTICLE I. - GENERAL STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 45-1. - Statutory authorization. 
Municipality. The legislature of the state of South Carolina has in S.C. Code of Laws, Title 5 and Title 6, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Aiken, South Carolina does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2018)  
Sec. 45-2. - Findings of fact. 
The special flood hazard areas of the city of Aiken are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2018)  
Sec. 45-3. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
The objectives of this article are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs. 
(Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2018)  
Sec. 45-4. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city of Aiken as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study, dated August 16, 2018 with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study for the unincorporated areas of Aiken County, with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2018)

When the local floodplain administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his/her duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property he owns. 
(f)  Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the floodplain administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, that: 
(1)  The building or property is in violation of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, 
(2)  A hearing will be held before the local floodplain administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and, 
(3)  Following the hearing, the local floodplain administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
(g)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the floodplain administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, he/she shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, not less than 60 days, the floodplain administrator may prescribe; provided that where the floodplain administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(h)  Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of appeal in writing to the floodplain administrator and the clerk within ten days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the floodplain administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(i)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the court. 
(j)  Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared in violation of this article and after all other penalties are exhausted to achieve compliance with this article then the local floodplain administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a section 1316 of the National Flood insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with the article. Once a violation has been remedied the local floodplain administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the section 1316 be rescinded.

ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 
 
Sec. 45-41. - General standards. 
Development may not occur in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) where alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be located out of the SFHA and that encroachments onto the SFHA are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Reasonably safe from flooding. Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
(2)  Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure. 
(3)  Flood Resistant Materials and Equipment. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(4)  Minimize flood damage. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, 
(5)  Critical development shall be elevated to the 500 year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500 year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500 year flood elevation data, 
(6)  Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood plus one foot. 
(7)  Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system, 
(8)  Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(9)  Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation and lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads. 
(10)  Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development and structures. 
(11)  Non-conforming buildings or uses. Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Provided, however, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter, 
(12)  American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in section 45-42, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2018)  
Sec. 45-42. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazard (Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 45-4 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local floodplain administrator section 45-34, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection 45-42(4). 
(2)  Non-residential construction. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection 45-42(4). No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
b.  A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in subsection 45-33(b)(1). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 45-55 of this chapter. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 45-55 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The local floodplain administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to it. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions for residential construction in subsection 45-42(1) of this chapter must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement in accordance with section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height an engineering certification is required. 
d.  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local floodplain administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
2.  The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening. 
3.  Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area. 
4.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
5.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building. 
b.  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
c.  Enclosures below lowest floor. 
1.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
2.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required for safety, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
3.  One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in subsections 45-42(1), (2) and (3). 
4.  All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in subsections 45-42 (1), (2), (3) and (4) should be of flood resistant materials. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 45-4, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
1.  It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local floodplain administrator. 
2.  A Conditional Letter of Map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development. 
b.  If subsection 45-42(5)a is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV. 
c.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection 45-42(3) and the encroachment standards of subsection 45-42(5)a are met. 
d.  Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration. 
(6)  Recreational vehicles. 
a.  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is: 
1.  On wheels or jacking system; 
2.  Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices; and 
3.  Has no permanently attached additions. 
b.  Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be: 
1.  On site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the development permit and certification requirements of section 45-34, general standards outlined in section 45-41, and manufactured homes standards in subsection 45-42(3) and 45-42(4). 
(7)  Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data identified in section 45-4 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance activities are identified: 
a.  Requirement to submit new technical data. 
1.  For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical or scientific data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA as soon as practicable, but no later than six months of the date such information becomes available.

(Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2018)  
Sec. 45-54. - Functionally dependent uses. 
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exist, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety. 
(Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2018)  
Sec. 45-55. - Agricultural structures. 
Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure provided it is used solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of the conditions and considerations of section 45-58, this section, and the following standards: 
(1)  Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed below: 
a.  Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of farm machinery and equipment, 
b.  Steel grain bins and steel frame corncribs, 
c.  General-purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock that are open on at least one side; 
d.  For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for structures that were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial improvement of such structures must meet the elevation requirements of subsection 45-42(2) of this chapter; and, 
(2)  The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building that is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base flood elevation. 
(3)  The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood velocities exceed five feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls. 
(4)  The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of subsection 45-42(4) of this chapter. 
(5)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation (BFE), plus any required freeboard, or be contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with subsection 45-41(5) of this chapter. 
(6)  The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of subsection 45-42(5) of this chapter. 
(7)  Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 05142018B , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2018)  
Sec. 45-56. - Considerations. 
In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Aiken, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1999 Code, as revised June 2009, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1999 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts separated by a decimal. The figure before the first decimal refers to the chapter number. The figure after the first decimal is the article number. The figure after the second decimal refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1, article 2, is numbered 1.2.1. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
ZONING CODE 1:1 ZONING CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES ZCT:1 ZONING CODE INDEX Zi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted.

The RSA District includes mandatory design standards to promote appropriate design and compatibility with surrounding uses. (Ord. 06112007A) 
2.2.5. - Manufactured Home (RSM) District. 
    The Residential Manufactured Home (RSM) District provides for low-density residential neighborhoods by prohibiting multifamily residential, commercial, industrial, and any other incompatible use of land, while allowing for manufactured housing units.

ARTICLE 3. - SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS 

2.3.1. - Planned Residential Development (PR) District. 
    The Planned Residential (PR) District permits greater flexibility and more creative and imaginative design for the development of residential areas than is generally possible in other residential districts while potentially allowing a limited range of nonresidential uses primarily serving the residents of the PR project. In exchange for there typically being no minimum lot sizes and widths or minimum setbacks, and a variety of housing types, the developer gives City Council control of the details of a proposed project through approval of a concept plan. The District promotes more economical and efficient use of the land, a harmonious variety of housing types, a higher level of amenities, compatibility with surrounding uses, preservation of natural features and open space, and the interconnection of trails and sidewalks. 
(Ord. 11272006A) 
2.3.2. - Horse (HD) District.

The District prohibits retail trade and is primarily intended to serve as a transition between more intense commercial uses and existing residential areas. 
2.4.2. - Limited Business (LB) District.

2.4.3. - Office/Institutional (O) District. 
    The Office/Institutional (O) District provides locations for a wide range of professional offices, institutions, selected service uses, and, where appropriate, residential uses. Primarily intended for location along major roadways, the District is also intended for areas dominated by institutions such as a hospital or college. 
2.4.4. - General Business (GB) District. 
    The General Business (GB) District allows a broad range of commercial uses offering both retail goods and services, and, where appropriate, residential uses. Because the district is intended to serve people from throughout the community who use automobiles to reach the uses, it is located along major roadways, but uses should also be accessible to pedestrians. 
2.4.5. - Planned Commercial (PC) District. 
    The Planned Commercial (PC) District provides for a group of commercial establishments offering a wide range of retail goods and services that are planned and developed as a unit, and, where appropriate, residential uses.

2.4.6. - Planned Institutional (PI) District. 
    The Planned Institutional zone provides locations for schools, churches, and some other institutional uses in locations which may affect residential or other more restrictive zones or less intense uses. The District requires a concept plan approved by City Council after Planning Commission review which may address site layout, building design, tree protection and buffers, and other issues to assure compatibility with surrounding uses. 
(Ord. 09082008C) 
2.4.7. - Downtown Business (DB) District. 
    The Downtown Business (DB) District provides for the central commercial and civic functions in the City in a compact area offering maximum convenience. Although activities are intended to be walking-scale, they serve the entire community. The integration of retail, service, entertainment, government, and residential uses is encouraged. 
ARTICLE 5. - INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS 

2.5.1. - Light Industrial (LI) District. 
    The Light Industrial (LI) District provides for low-intensity industrial uses, warehousing, and wholesaling activities that do not overburden the available streets, infrastructure, or public services.

A.  It is essential that the qualities, areas, sites, structures, and natural and man-made objects relating to the history of the City of Aiken, as well as that of Aiken County, the State of South Carolina, and the United States of America, be preserved and that a generally harmonious exterior appearance of areas, sites, structures, and objects that preserves property values and attracts businesses, tourists, and residents alike be promoted.

2.  Preserve the integrity and stability of neighborhoods and business areas; 
3.  Conserve and enhance property values of historic areas, sites, structures, districts, neighborhoods, and geographically associated areas; and

    This district is designed to promote a high level of aesthetics and the economic stability of the downtown area by protecting and enhancing the appearance of existing structures and the appearance of new structures.

ARTICLE 2. - USE CATEGORIES 

3.2.1. - General. 
A.  Basis for Classifications. Use Categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, likely impact on surrounding properties, and site conditions. The Use Categories provide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate zoning districts. 
B.  Principal Use Characteristics. A principal use is assigned to the Use Category that most closely corresponds to its nature as described in the "Characteristics" subsection of each Use Category. 
C.  Considerations Regarding Principal Uses. 
1.  Determination of the appropriate category for a proposed principal use shall be made by the Planning Director in accordance with the provisions of 6.2.2. 
2.  The following shall be used to determine (1) the appropriate category for a use not specifically listed in the Use Tables or the examples in the Use Category descriptions, and (2) whether a use is considered principal or accessory. 
a.  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each Use Category. 
b.  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity. 
c.  Relative amounts of sales from each activity. 
d.  The customer type for each activity. 
e.  The relative number of employees in each activity. 
f.  Hours of operation. 
g.  Building and site arrangement. 
h.  Vehicles used and their parking requirements. 
i.  The relative number of vehicle trips generated. 
j.  Signs. 
k.  How the use is advertised. 
l.  The likely impact on surrounding properties. 
m.  Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site. 
3.  When considering appropriate districts for a use not listed in the Use Tables, the district intent statements in Chapter 2 shall be taken into consideration. 
D.  Developments with Multiple Principal Uses. Developments with multiple principal uses shall conform to the following. 
1.  When all principal uses of a development fall within one Use Category, the entire development is assigned to that Use Category. 
2.  When the principal uses of a development fall within different Use Categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable Use Category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that Use Category. 
3.  Developments with multiple principal uses (such as shopping centers) shall incorporate only those uses allowed in the underlying district. 
E.  Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated elsewhere in this Ordinance. Also, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the Use Category descriptions. 
F.  Use of Examples. The "Examples" subsection of each Use Category lists uses common to that Use Category. The names of these sample uses are generic and are based on common meanings, not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "Wholesale Warehouse," but sells mostly to retail consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Trade category.

ARTICLE 6. - LANDSCAPING AND TREE PRESERVATION 

4.6.1. - Purposes. 
    This Article is intended to promote the preservation and installation of high quality trees and other plant material for the purposes of implementing the policies of the Comprehensive Plan and protecting public safety, health, and welfare through the benefits such vegetation provides, including, but not limited to the following. 
1.  Absorbing carbon dioxide and returning oxygen. 
2.  Precipitating unwanted particles from the air, thereby reducing air pollution. 
3.  Providing shade and making outdoor areas more habitable in summer. 
4.  Reducing soil erosion and increasing infiltration. 
5.  Reducing noise levels. 
6.  Improving City appearance and retaining its character, promoting civic pride, emotional health, and the local economy, including property values and tourism. 
7.  Providing wildlife habitat, thus helping to control insects. 
4.6.2. - Jurisdiction. 
    This Article shall apply to all lands within the corporate limits of the City of Aiken, and may apply, as required or approved by City Council, to land outside the City limits granted City water, sanitary sewer, or other services by the City. The Planning Director may waive any provision in this article that would conflict with a requirement of the Public Safety Department. 
4.6.3. - Removal of Existing Trees on Land Not Being Developed. 
A.  The natural landscape, including existing trees, shall be preserved wherever possible. On land zoned to permit any use other than single-family residential (except land zoned Planned Residential for which a concept plan depicting single-family residential use has been approved), no Significant or Grand Tree may be removed unless one or more of the following can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Director after consultation with appropriate city staff members including but not limited to the City Horticulturist. 
It is in the interest of good forestry management. 
The tree is diseased, dying, or dead. 
The tree causes a safety hazard to nearby buildings or pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
The tree is a Pine, Pecan, or Magnolia that is dropping debris or sap that is significantly affecting vehicles in a parking lot though any such tree removed will have to be replaced with an equal number of caliper inches or, if there is not room, an amount placed into the Tree Fund in accordance with 4.6.4.B.2.d. 
The tree is causing significant structural damage to a building or other structure that reasonable maintenance cannot prevent. 
The tree is interfering with an existing underground utility line or overhead wiring. 
It is necessary to allow construction of a road essential for access to the site, subject to the requirement that the inches of Grand and Significant trees removed therefore shall be replaced when the site is developed. 
B.  If trees are removed on land zoned single-family residential, no application for rezoning to a commercial or multifamily residential zoning classification will be considered for two years after City staff determines that such removal has occurred. 
(Ord. No. 12142015C , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-2015) 
4.6.4. - Removal of Trees Associated With Development. 
    Prior to issuance of a building permit for a nonresidential or multifamily residential project, a landscape plan must be approved in accordance with 6.2.10 and the following provisions. Prior to issuance of a building permit for any portion of a project consisting of attached single-family or duplex residential units, the following provisions must be met. (Ord. 12122005A) Issuance of a building permit for a detached single-family dwelling in a commercial or multifamily residential zone shall be conditioned on a stipulation that, if Significant or Grand Trees are removed, no building permit for a permitted use other than detached single-family residential shall be issued for three years from the date of issuance of the permit. (Ord. 03132006) 
A.  Tree Survey. 
1.  For every project one of the following shall be submitted. 
a.  A detailed tree survey of the entire site depicting the DBH, variety, and location of all Significant and Grand trees including the information listed in 6.2.10.D; or 
b.  A detailed tree survey depicting the DBH, variety, and location of the Grand Trees on the entire site and the Significant Trees in the yard including the information listed in 6.2.10.D and a listing of all Significant Trees in the buildable area including DBH and variety, and, if required by the Planning Director, a tree survey of selected areas or other additional information where it is necessary to make a determination about the feasibility of saving Significant Trees. 
2.  Information required by paragraph 1 shall be prepared by a licensed engineer, surveyor, landscape architect, forester, arborist or other person with demonstrated experience in preparing accurate tree surveys as determined by the Planning Director. Such information shall not be more than two years old on the date of submission of the application for landscape plan approval. 
B.  Tree Protection Areas. 
1.  Planting Strip Along Street Rights-of-Way. 
a.  Depth. A planting strip shall be provided parallel and adjacent to each street right-of-way the depth of which shall be based on the following table. The maximum required depth under this provision shall be 25 feet, but a deeper planting strip may be provided. 
Lot Depth Planting Strip Depth Up to 200 feet 10 feet 200 to 500 feet 5 percent of lot depth More than 500 feet 25 feet  
b.  Protection of Significant and Grand Trees. Within the planting strip, all Grand and Significant trees shall remain unless their preservation would prevent the installation of a necessary driveway, sidewalk, permitted sign, or essential utility. All such driveways, sidewalks, signs, and utilities shall be located so as to preserve the maximum number of Grand and Significant Trees as determined by the Planning Director. To insure tree survival, a protected area pursuant to 4.6.5.B shall be provided around each tree as required by the Planning Director. 
c.  Minimum Number of Trees. Existing trees may be counted in meeting the requirement for trees in the planting strip at 4.6.7.B. To be counted, a tree must have a DBH of two inches. The type and condition of such trees are subject to approval by the Planning Director for that purpose and must be depicted on the landscape plan. If existing trees do not satisfy the requirement, a sufficient number must be planted to comply with 4.6.7.B. 
2.  Entire Site. 
a.  Removal. No Grand Tree may be removed unless the Planning Director determines there is absolutely no alternative because of unavoidable grading or because of the required configuration of paving, essential utilities, or buildings. No more than 80 percent of the DBH inches of Significant Trees may be removed unless the Planning Director determines there is absolutely no alternative because of unavoidable grading or because of the required configuration of paving, essential utilities, or buildings. 
b.  Location of Saved Trees. No more than 25 percent of saved trees may be located in the rear yard unless there are not enough trees on other parts of the site to meet this requirement. 
c.  Replacement. 
i.  Grand and Significant DBH inches removed shall be replaced, except for trees removed (1) pursuant to the requirements of City ordinances and regulations, (2) after determination by the City Horticulturist to be diseased, dying, or dead, or (3) in conjunction with construction of athletic fields at a public or private school required by the South Carolina State Department of Education or other licensing or accreditation organizations for such schools. 
ii.  The cumulative caliper of replacement trees shall at least equal the cumulative DBH of the Grand and Significant Trees removed except that the DBH of any Grand or Significant Trees on the Approved Tree List saved or approved trees newly planted may count as double replacement inches under this provision. 
iii.  Trees planted to meet other requirements of this Article may be counted as replacement trees. The minimum caliper for a replacement tree shall be two inches and be from the Approved Tree List. 
iv.  The Planning Director shall approve the type, size, and location of each replacement tree. 
v.  Where the Planning Director determines that planting the required number of trees on the site will result in an unacceptable density of trees based upon good forestry management, the Planning Director may reduce that number; provided, however, that off street parking shall be limited to no more than ten percent over the minimum number of parking spaces required by 4.5.1 if necessary to maximize the number of replacement trees to be planted on the site. 
d.  Tree Fund. If there is not sufficient room on the site to plant the required replacement DBH inches, a payment-in-lieu-of-planting shall be made to the Tree Fund to be used for the planting of trees on City property. The amount shall be determined by the City Horticulturist based on the retail value of the trees, but in no case shall the total amount exceed $500 per acre of the site. 
4.6.5.   Tree Protection During and After Development.
A.  Standards. Trees that are to remain or are planted shall be protected in accordance with standards provided in paragraph B below and the Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual. The standards in the Manual shall provide for protective barriers around trees, the prevention of compaction or other disturbance within the protected area as set forth at 4.6.5.B, and the installation of utilities. 
B.  Protected Areas. During grading and construction, a protected area equal to one foot radius for every inch of DBH of each tree shall be provided within which paving, grading, or the storage of dirt, building materials, debris, or any other materials or any other equipment shall not be allowed. Each protected area shall be enclosed by a barrier constructed in a manner required and approved by the Planning Director prior to issuance of a grading permit. Failure to maintain barriers may result in revocation of the building and/or grading permit. For projects not requiring a grading permit, installation of the required barriers shall be approved by the Planning Director prior to issuance of a building permit. Protective barriers shall be maintained until issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The protected area shall be permanent and maintained by the property owner. No pavement shall be installed in the protected area. The Planning Director may reduce the protected area or allow intrusions into it if such actions would not adversely affect the survival and health of the tree. 
C.  Tree Maintenance. The following tree maintenance provisions shall apply to all trees on the subject site included in the Protected Tree List or Approved Tree List in the Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual (Ord. 11222010A), not just those planted pursuant to this Article except for trees on a lot occupied by a dwelling unit in an attached single-family or duplex residential project. (Ord. 12122005A) No matter what pruning methods are used, no more than one-fourth of the crown should be removed in any one growing season. 
1.  Where necessary to improve visibility for public safety purposes, suckers or limbs below seven feet in height may be removed through proper crown raising or elevating. 
2.  Maintenance of trees shall take their natural shape and growth patterns into account. Trees that are intended to grow full to the ground, such as Magnolias, shall not be limbed up. 
3.  No topping or heading back shall be permitted which involves the cutting of limbs back to a stub, bud, or lateral branch not large enough to assume the terminal role. Crown reduction shall be used to reduce the size of a tree and is best accomplished by cutting limbs back to laterals that are at least one-third the diameter of the parent limb. 
D.  Approved Landscape Plan To Be On Site. During construction and until issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, a copy of the approved landscape plan must be kept on the site. 
4.6.6.   Removal of Trees After Development.
A.  After issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for a commercial or multifamily residential project located in a zoning district, no Significant or Grand Tree may be removed unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Director after consultation with appropriate city staff members including but not limited to the City Horticulturist that one or more of the conditions at 4.6.3.A(1-7) exists. 
B.  The Planning Director may also allow the removal of a Significant or Grand tree that has been planted as a requirement of this ordinance, or a supplementary tree planted after development, if it can be demonstrated that the tree is affecting the primary approval use of the subject property. 
The cumulative caliper of the trees removed shall be replaced on-site from the Approved Tree List if possible as determined by the City Horticulturist. If applicable, a revised landscape plan may be required to be submitted to the Planning Department for review. 
C.  This provision shall also apply to the common areas of an attached single-family or duplex residential project in any zoning district. (Ord. 12122005A) Portions of any golf course associated with play such as fairways, tee boxes, greens, rough, and practice areas shall be exempt from this provision. (Ord. 09272004) Public parks and recreational facilities are also exempt from this provision. 
(Ord. No. 07142014D , § 1(Exh. A), 7-14-2014; Ord. No. 10132014B , § 1(Exh. A), 10-13-2014; Ord. No. 12142015C , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-2015) 
4.6.7.   Landscaping Requirements.
A.  Area Required to be Landscaped. Where not expressly set forth in 4.2.1 or 4.3.1, the minimum required landscaped area shall be 20 percent of the site for commercial uses and 40 percent of the site for multifamily residential uses. The planting strip may be included in calculating the required landscaped area. Where a portion of a larger undeveloped tract is being developed, only landscaped area reasonably associated with the project as determined by the Planning Director shall be counted in meeting the requirements of this provision. 
B.  Plantings in Strip Along the Street Frontage. 
1.  Trees. 
a.  Number, Size and Spacing. With respect to the approval of a site/landscape plan for a new development, the maximum number of trees must be planted in the planting strip, required by 4.6.4.B.1, as determined by the Planning Director taking into account the size of the trees at maturity except, to allow for the location of a freestanding sign, there may be a gap of no more than 40 feet where Small Trees are planted and 60 feet where Large Trees are planted (Ord. 11222010A). The Planning Director shall approve the type, size, and location of replacement trees. Subject to the approval of the Planning Director, any combination of large and small trees may be planted to meet the minimum required number. Any area in the planting strip beyond the minimum required by this Article shall not be included in determining the number of trees required to be planted. Each tree planted in the planting strip shall have a minimum caliper of two inches and be selected from the Approved Tree List. Where necessary, trees may be limbed up to allow visibility for motorists in accordance with 4.6.5.C.1. The Planning Director may allow a smaller tree to be planted in the planting strip where overhead power lines would interfere with the growth of a larger tree. 
b.  Existing Trees. As provided in 4.6.4.B.1.c, an existing tree may be counted towards meeting the requirements of this Article provided that the tree has a DBH of at least two inches and the type and condition of the tree are approved for that purpose by the Planning Director. Such trees must be depicted on the landscape plan. 
2.  Shrubbery or Planted Berms. Evergreen shrubbery or a planted berm is required in the planting strip to screen the fronts of vehicles. The shrubbery must be at least three feet high after pruning at the time of planting and be planted no more than five feet on center. A berm must be at least three feet high and be planted with ground cover. 
C.  Planting Areas along Side and Rear Property Lines. Planting areas at least five feet in depth shall be provided along the entire side and rear property lines or site boundaries not located adjacent to a street right-of-way. The maximum possible number of trees must be planted therein as determined by the Planning Director taking into account the size of the trees at maturity based on the required minimum depth of five feet. The Planning Director shall approve the type, size, and location of the trees. Existing trees may be counted towards meeting the requirements of this provision in the same manner as provided in 4.6.4.B.1.c and 4.6.7.B.1.b. Trees on adjacent property that may conflict with planting new trees should be depicted on the landscape plan. These planting areas are required in addition to the planting strip along the street frontage and shall be considered part of the yard area. Where a joint driveway is proposed to serve two lots which would reduce the number of curb cuts, the Planning Director may modify the provisions of this section. 
D.  Landscaping in Vehicular Use Areas. 
1.  Perimeter Planting Areas. Each parking area should be defined by linear landscaped areas to delineate driveways and control traffic flow. Such linear landscaped areas should be at least eight feet in width and include canopy trees as determined by the Planning Director unless such trees would interfere with traffic movement in which case other types of trees may be used. 
2.  Islands Between Parking Spaces. In a parking area with more than one double bay of parking spaces, no more than 10 spaces are allowed in a row without a landscaped island of at least 300 square feet excluding curbing and having a minimum width of eight feet. Each such island shall have at least one canopy tree allowed in parking lots as set forth in the Approved Tree List. Such islands must be offset so that they are evenly distributed in the parking area and are not in straight lines. 
3.  Islands at End of Row. A landscaped island of at least 100 square feet in area shall be provided at the end of each single row of parking spaces closest to a building; each such island shall have a berm two feet high planted with ground cover, or, where there are two such islands together totaling at least 200 square feet, at least one small tree allowed in parking lots as set forth in the Approved Tree List. A landscaped island of at least 150 square feet shall be provided at the end of each single row of parking spaces nearest the street frontage; where there are two such islands together totaling at least 300 square feet, there shall be at least one canopy tree. The islands shall be designed and maintained so as not to obstruct visibility for motorists. The Planning Director may modify or waive this provision if compliance would not be practical. 
4.  Trees in Islands. Islands shall be located to preserve the maximum number of existing trees. The maximum number of trees must be planted as determined by the Planning Director taking into account the size of the trees at maturity. The Planning Director shall approve the size, type, and location of the trees. Any combination of large and small trees may be planted to meet the minimum number required by this provision with the approval of the Planning Director. 
5.  Screening of Dumpsters. Dumpsters, utility boxes, and similar structures must be screened by evergreen shrubbery at least three feet high after pruning at the time of planting. 
E.  Buffer or Screening Device. A landscaped buffer strip shall be required for any nonresidential or multifamily residential use where it abuts an area zoned or used residentially or for any attached single-family or duplex residential project where it abuts land occupied by single-family dwellings or zoned in a single-family residential category. (Ord. 12122005A) The buffer strip shall be a minimum of 10 feet in depth and be undisturbed. Additional evergreen vegetation shall be planted to form an effective screen; such vegetation shall be at least three feet high after pruning at time of planting and a height of at least seven feet at maturity with spacing as required by the City. Where deemed necessary by the Planning Director, additional measures may be required to provide an effective screen. Any screening buffer area shall be maintained in good order at all times by the owner of the property. 
F.  Detention Ponds and Lakes. A detention pond may be counted as landscaped area unless it is unable to support healthy trees as determined by the City Engineer and Planning Director. Each detention pond shall be screened for aesthetic purposes pursuant to the standards in the Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual provided for by 4.6.9 or as otherwise directed by the Planning Director to accomplish the purposes of this Article. A lake shall be counted as landscaped area if approved by the City Engineer and Planning Director as effecting the purposes of this Article. 
G.  Design of Project Landscaping. Landscaping installed during development should meet the following design guidelines. 
1.  Landscaping should be designed for the long term; the size of plants at maturity should be considered when selecting plant material and designing its installation. 
2.  Landscaping should continue thematic elements, if any, found in the surrounding area, including plant types and planting patterns. 
3.  Landscaping should be designed to be functional (reducing the heat island effect of impervious surfaces, helping to control runoff, etc.), as well as beautiful. 
4.  Crape Myrtles may not be planted along street rights-of-way unless necessitated by overhead wiring or other reason associated with the particular location as approved by the Planning Director. 
H.  Irrigation. An automatic irrigation system must be installed to water all new landscaped areas. The system must remain operational and have a timer set to water plantings to keep them alive. 
4.6.8.   Completion and Maintenance of Landscaping.
A.  Completion. 
1.  All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the approved landscape plan unless substitutions are approved by the Planning Director and noted in writing on the plan. A Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy or business license for any business or use on a site with such an approved plan shall not be issued until the installation of the required landscaping is approved by the Planning Director or a cash or equivalent performance guarantee is posted with the Planning Director in the minimum amount of 110 percent of the total cost of the required uncompleted landscaping, including the labor, as determined by the Planning Director. A site not requiring a Certificate of Occupancy may not be used until the required landscaping is installed or a guarantee posted. 
2.  The guarantee shall be in a form approved by the Planning Director and shall be released and returned to the party posting the guarantee upon installation of all required landscaping and acceptance by the Planning Director of such installation. The landscaping shall be installed within three months of the posting of the performance guarantee with the Planning Director. However, the Planning Director may extend the time period for installation of landscaping for a maximum of an additional three months if weather conditions are not suitable for such installation or trees are not available during the initial three-month period. If the landscaping is not installed within the required period, the guarantee shall be forfeited to and used by the City to complete the approved landscaping with any remaining funds being returned to the party who posted the guarantee. For a project in an unincorporated area receiving City services and for which a landscape plan has been approved, the use of those services may not commence until the requirements of this Article are met. 
B.  Maintenance. The property owners, occupants, and tenants or their agents shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. All landscaping required by or installed pursuant to landscaping plans approved under this Article or prior ordinances shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance; shall be kept free of refuse, debris, and dead, diseased, or severely damaged plants or vegetation; and shall contain at all times the number, variety, and location of plants and trees required thereby. 
4.6.9.   Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual.
    The City Horticulturist shall promulgate mandatory standards for the installation, maintenance, survival, health and protection of trees and landscaping required to be retained, planted, installed, or maintained by this Article or prior ordinances. Those standards shall promote and effect the purposes set forth in 4.6.1 and be compiled in a Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual including compliance with the most recent version of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). (Ord. 11222010A) The Manual shall also establish an Approved Tree List setting forth trees allowed to be planted including those permitted in parking lots. 
4.6.5. - Tree Protection During and After Development. 
A.  Standards. Trees that are to remain or are planted shall be protected in accordance with standards provided in paragraph B below and the Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual. The standards in the Manual shall provide for protective barriers around trees, the prevention of compaction or other disturbance within the protected area as set forth at 4.6.5.B, and the installation of utilities. 
B.  Protected Areas. During grading and construction, a protected area equal to one foot radius for every inch of DBH of each tree shall be provided within which paving, grading, or the storage of dirt, building materials, debris, or any other materials or any other equipment shall not be allowed. Each protected area shall be enclosed by a barrier constructed in a manner required and approved by the Planning Director prior to issuance of a grading permit. Failure to maintain barriers may result in revocation of the building and/or grading permit. For projects not requiring a grading permit, installation of the required barriers shall be approved by the Planning Director prior to issuance of a building permit. Protective barriers shall be maintained until issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The protected area shall be permanent and maintained by the property owner. No pavement shall be installed in the protected area. The Planning Director may reduce the protected area or allow intrusions into it if such actions would not adversely affect the survival and health of the tree. 
C.  Tree Maintenance. The following tree maintenance provisions shall apply to all trees on the subject site included in the Protected Tree List or Approved Tree List in the Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual (Ord. 11222010A), not just those planted pursuant to this Article except for trees on a lot occupied by a dwelling unit in an attached single-family or duplex residential project. (Ord. 12122005A) No matter what pruning methods are used, no more than one-fourth of the crown should be removed in any one growing season. 
1.  Where necessary to improve visibility for public safety purposes, suckers or limbs below seven feet in height may be removed through proper crown raising or elevating. 
2.  Maintenance of trees shall take their natural shape and growth patterns into account. Trees that are intended to grow full to the ground, such as Magnolias, shall not be limbed up. 
3.  No topping or heading back shall be permitted which involves the cutting of limbs back to a stub, bud, or lateral branch not large enough to assume the terminal role. Crown reduction shall be used to reduce the size of a tree and is best accomplished by cutting limbs back to laterals that are at least one-third the diameter of the parent limb. 
D.  Approved Landscape Plan To Be On Site. During construction and until issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, a copy of the approved landscape plan must be kept on the site. 
4.6.6. - Removal of Trees After Development. 
A.  After issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for a commercial or multifamily residential project located in a zoning district, no Significant or Grand Tree may be removed unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Director after consultation with appropriate city staff members including but not limited to the City Horticulturist that one or more of the conditions at 4.6.3.A(1-7) exists. 
B.  The Planning Director may also allow the removal of a Significant or Grand tree that has been planted as a requirement of this ordinance, or a supplementary tree planted after development, if it can be demonstrated that the tree is affecting the primary approval use of the subject property. 
The cumulative caliper of the trees removed shall be replaced on-site from the Approved Tree List if possible as determined by the City Horticulturist. If applicable, a revised landscape plan may be required to be submitted to the Planning Department for review. 
C.  This provision shall also apply to the common areas of an attached single-family or duplex residential project in any zoning district. (Ord. 12122005A) Portions of any golf course associated with play such as fairways, tee boxes, greens, rough, and practice areas shall be exempt from this provision. (Ord. 09272004) Public parks and recreational facilities are also exempt from this provision.

4.6.7. - Landscaping Requirements. 
A.  Area Required to be Landscaped. Where not expressly set forth in 4.2.1 or 4.3.1, the minimum required landscaped area shall be 20 percent of the site for commercial uses and 40 percent of the site for multifamily residential uses. The planting strip may be included in calculating the required landscaped area. Where a portion of a larger undeveloped tract is being developed, only landscaped area reasonably associated with the project as determined by the Planning Director shall be counted in meeting the requirements of this provision. 
B.  Plantings in Strip Along the Street Frontage. 
1.  Trees. 
a.  Number, Size and Spacing. With respect to the approval of a site/landscape plan for a new development, the maximum number of trees must be planted in the planting strip, required by 4.6.4.B.1, as determined by the Planning Director taking into account the size of the trees at maturity except, to allow for the location of a freestanding sign, there may be a gap of no more than 40 feet where Small Trees are planted and 60 feet where Large Trees are planted (Ord. 11222010A). The Planning Director shall approve the type, size, and location of replacement trees. Subject to the approval of the Planning Director, any combination of large and small trees may be planted to meet the minimum required number. Any area in the planting strip beyond the minimum required by this Article shall not be included in determining the number of trees required to be planted. Each tree planted in the planting strip shall have a minimum caliper of two inches and be selected from the Approved Tree List. Where necessary, trees may be limbed up to allow visibility for motorists in accordance with 4.6.5.C.1. The Planning Director may allow a smaller tree to be planted in the planting strip where overhead power lines would interfere with the growth of a larger tree. 
b.  Existing Trees. As provided in 4.6.4.B.1.c, an existing tree may be counted towards meeting the requirements of this Article provided that the tree has a DBH of at least two inches and the type and condition of the tree are approved for that purpose by the Planning Director. Such trees must be depicted on the landscape plan. 
2.  Shrubbery or Planted Berms. Evergreen shrubbery or a planted berm is required in the planting strip to screen the fronts of vehicles. The shrubbery must be at least three feet high after pruning at the time of planting and be planted no more than five feet on center. A berm must be at least three feet high and be planted with ground cover. 
C.  Planting Areas along Side and Rear Property Lines. Planting areas at least five feet in depth shall be provided along the entire side and rear property lines or site boundaries not located adjacent to a street right-of-way. The maximum possible number of trees must be planted therein as determined by the Planning Director taking into account the size of the trees at maturity based on the required minimum depth of five feet. The Planning Director shall approve the type, size, and location of the trees. Existing trees may be counted towards meeting the requirements of this provision in the same manner as provided in 4.6.4.B.1.c and 4.6.7.B.1.b. Trees on adjacent property that may conflict with planting new trees should be depicted on the landscape plan. These planting areas are required in addition to the planting strip along the street frontage and shall be considered part of the yard area. Where a joint driveway is proposed to serve two lots which would reduce the number of curb cuts, the Planning Director may modify the provisions of this section. 
D.  Landscaping in Vehicular Use Areas. 
1.  Perimeter Planting Areas. Each parking area should be defined by linear landscaped areas to delineate driveways and control traffic flow. Such linear landscaped areas should be at least eight feet in width and include canopy trees as determined by the Planning Director unless such trees would interfere with traffic movement in which case other types of trees may be used. 
2.  Islands Between Parking Spaces. In a parking area with more than one double bay of parking spaces, no more than 10 spaces are allowed in a row without a landscaped island of at least 300 square feet excluding curbing and having a minimum width of eight feet. Each such island shall have at least one canopy tree allowed in parking lots as set forth in the Approved Tree List. Such islands must be offset so that they are evenly distributed in the parking area and are not in straight lines. 
3.  Islands at End of Row. A landscaped island of at least 100 square feet in area shall be provided at the end of each single row of parking spaces closest to a building; each such island shall have a berm two feet high planted with ground cover, or, where there are two such islands together totaling at least 200 square feet, at least one small tree allowed in parking lots as set forth in the Approved Tree List. A landscaped island of at least 150 square feet shall be provided at the end of each single row of parking spaces nearest the street frontage; where there are two such islands together totaling at least 300 square feet, there shall be at least one canopy tree. The islands shall be designed and maintained so as not to obstruct visibility for motorists. The Planning Director may modify or waive this provision if compliance would not be practical. 
4.  Trees in Islands. Islands shall be located to preserve the maximum number of existing trees. The maximum number of trees must be planted as determined by the Planning Director taking into account the size of the trees at maturity. The Planning Director shall approve the size, type, and location of the trees. Any combination of large and small trees may be planted to meet the minimum number required by this provision with the approval of the Planning Director. 
5.  Screening of Dumpsters. Dumpsters, utility boxes, and similar structures must be screened by evergreen shrubbery at least three feet high after pruning at the time of planting. 
E.  Buffer or Screening Device. A landscaped buffer strip shall be required for any nonresidential or multifamily residential use where it abuts an area zoned or used residentially or for any attached single-family or duplex residential project where it abuts land occupied by single-family dwellings or zoned in a single-family residential category. (Ord. 12122005A) The buffer strip shall be a minimum of 10 feet in depth and be undisturbed. Additional evergreen vegetation shall be planted to form an effective screen; such vegetation shall be at least three feet high after pruning at time of planting and a height of at least seven feet at maturity with spacing as required by the City. Where deemed necessary by the Planning Director, additional measures may be required to provide an effective screen. Any screening buffer area shall be maintained in good order at all times by the owner of the property. 
F.  Detention Ponds and Lakes. A detention pond may be counted as landscaped area unless it is unable to support healthy trees as determined by the City Engineer and Planning Director. Each detention pond shall be screened for aesthetic purposes pursuant to the standards in the Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual provided for by 4.6.9 or as otherwise directed by the Planning Director to accomplish the purposes of this Article. A lake shall be counted as landscaped area if approved by the City Engineer and Planning Director as effecting the purposes of this Article. 
G.  Design of Project Landscaping. Landscaping installed during development should meet the following design guidelines. 
1.  Landscaping should be designed for the long term; the size of plants at maturity should be considered when selecting plant material and designing its installation. 
2.  Landscaping should continue thematic elements, if any, found in the surrounding area, including plant types and planting patterns. 
3.  Landscaping should be designed to be functional (reducing the heat island effect of impervious surfaces, helping to control runoff, etc.), as well as beautiful. 
4.  Crape Myrtles may not be planted along street rights-of-way unless necessitated by overhead wiring or other reason associated with the particular location as approved by the Planning Director. 
H.  Irrigation. An automatic irrigation system must be installed to water all new landscaped areas. The system must remain operational and have a timer set to water plantings to keep them alive. 
4.6.8. - Completion and Maintenance of Landscaping. 
A.  Completion. 
1.  All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the approved landscape plan unless substitutions are approved by the Planning Director and noted in writing on the plan. A Certificate of Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy or business license for any business or use on a site with such an approved plan shall not be issued until the installation of the required landscaping is approved by the Planning Director or a cash or equivalent performance guarantee is posted with the Planning Director in the minimum amount of 110 percent of the total cost of the required uncompleted landscaping, including the labor, as determined by the Planning Director. A site not requiring a Certificate of Occupancy may not be used until the required landscaping is installed or a guarantee posted. 
2.  The guarantee shall be in a form approved by the Planning Director and shall be released and returned to the party posting the guarantee upon installation of all required landscaping and acceptance by the Planning Director of such installation. The landscaping shall be installed within three months of the posting of the performance guarantee with the Planning Director. However, the Planning Director may extend the time period for installation of landscaping for a maximum of an additional three months if weather conditions are not suitable for such installation or trees are not available during the initial three-month period. If the landscaping is not installed within the required period, the guarantee shall be forfeited to and used by the City to complete the approved landscaping with any remaining funds being returned to the party who posted the guarantee. For a project in an unincorporated area receiving City services and for which a landscape plan has been approved, the use of those services may not commence until the requirements of this Article are met. 
B.  Maintenance. The property owners, occupants, and tenants or their agents shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. All landscaping required by or installed pursuant to landscaping plans approved under this Article or prior ordinances shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance; shall be kept free of refuse, debris, and dead, diseased, or severely damaged plants or vegetation; and shall contain at all times the number, variety, and location of plants and trees required thereby. 
4.6.9. - Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual. 
    The City Horticulturist shall promulgate mandatory standards for the installation, maintenance, survival, health and protection of trees and landscaping required to be retained, planted, installed, or maintained by this Article or prior ordinances. Those standards shall promote and effect the purposes set forth in 4.6.1 and be compiled in a Tree Protection and Landscaping Manual including compliance with the most recent version of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

5.1.3. - Determination of Economic Hardship. 
A.  Submission Requirements. If an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness is denied by the Board, the applicant may request that the application be reviewed for economic hardship pursuant to this Section. The Board may obtain expert testimony and require the applicant make submissions concerning the following information before the Board makes a final determination on the application. 
1.  Estimate of the cost of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or relocation and an estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations or directives of the Board for changes necessary for issuance of a Certificate. 
2.  A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in rehabilitation on the structural soundness of any structures and their suitability for rehabilitation. 
3.  Estimated market value of the property under the following conditions: in its current condition; after completion of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or relocation; after any changes recommended or directed by the Board; and, in case of a proposed demolition, or relocation, after renovation of the existing property for continued use. The Board may require that these estimates be prepared by a qualified expert. 
4.  In the case of a proposed demolition or relocation, an estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of continued use, rehabilitation, or reuse of the existing structure at its current location. 
5.  Amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship, if any, between the owner-of-record or applicant and the person from whom the property was or is to be purchased, and the terms of financing. 
6.  If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from the property for the previous two calendar or fiscal years; itemized operating and maintenance expenses during the same period; and depreciation, deduction, and annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any, during the same period. 
7.  Any other information requested by the Board in its discretion to reach a determination as to whether the property does yield or may yield a reasonable return to the owners. 
B.  Review. The Board shall review all of the evidence and information required from the applicant, hold a public hearing, and make a determination thereon within 30 days after receipt of all required information of whether the denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness will result in economic hardship to the owner because he will not receive a reasonable rate of economic return on the property or will be deprived of all reasonable use of the property. If the Board makes a determination that, in its discretion, economic hardship has not been proven by the applicant, the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness based upon economic hardship shall be denied. If the Board determines, in its discretion, that economic hardship would occur to the owner, the Board may issue a Certificate of Appropriateness based upon economic hardship or delay action on the application for a period of 90 days. During this period the Board shall investigate and make recommendations for alternative uses and plans for the property. If at the end of the 90-day period, the Board finds, after a public hearing with the notice required by 5.2.3.D being given, that without issuance of the Certificate of Appropriateness, an economic hardship would still occur, then the Board shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness based upon economic hardship. 
ARTICLE 2. - HISTORIC OVERLAY

    Any property or structure listed on the Aiken Historic Register shall be subject to this Article.

A request for designation shall be made on the appropriate application form provided by the Board and submitted to the Board for review and public hearing. 
B.  Designation Criteria. For an Historic Site or Historic District (Ord. 04142003A) to be designated to the Aiken Historic Register, City Council must conclude that it: 
1.  is significant in American, South Carolina, or Aiken history, architecture, archeology, engineering, or culture; and (Ord. 04142003A) 
2.  has integrity of location, design, setting, materials, or workmanship that need to be protected or preserved and meets one or more of the following criteria: 
a.  it is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to history; 
b.  it is associated with the lives of persons significant in history; 
c.  it has distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of architecture or construction; represents the work of a master; possesses high artistic values; or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; 
d.  it has yielded or is likely to yield information important in prehistory or history; or 
e.  it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The proposed designation shall not become effective unless approved by City Council by adoption of an ordinance. At the time of designation of an Historic Site, City Council shall determine whether the affected structure is considered a Landmark, Contributing, or Non-Contributing, and, if a Landmark, whether work on the exterior not visible from a public street would require a Certificate pursuant to 5.2.3.A.1 (Ord. 04142003A) 
E.  Nominations to the National Register of Historic Places. The Board may conduct first review and evaluation of all proposed National Register nominations within the City, including any which may have been submitted to the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and forward all reviewed nominations to the SHPO with recommendations for consideration by the State Board of Review. 
F.  Refiling for Designation. If a request for designation is denied, the request may not be filed again for one year from the date of that denial unless the applicant can demonstrate to the Board a substantial change in circumstances relevant to the request.

J.  Review Standards. 
1.  General. In reviewing applications, the Board and the Planning Director shall consider the standards stated in this Chapter for the purpose of determining whether alterations, construction, demolitions, or relocations are in harmony with the prevailing historical, architectural, archeological, or aesthetic character of the Historic District, a structure in a Historic District, or an Historic Site, or a structure included in an Historic Site. (Ord. 04142003A) 
2.  Construction and Alteration. In reviewing an application for construction or alteration, the Board and the Planning Director shall consider general design, character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, texture and materials, relationship of such elements to similar features of structures in the immediate area, and the extent to which the alteration or construction would be harmonious with the Historic District or Historic Site in which it is located. (Ord. 04142003A) The Board and the Planning Director also shall consider the relevant standards and guidelines in the most current edition of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. 
3.  Demolition. In reviewing an application for demolition, the Board and the Planning Director shall consider the historical, archeological, and aesthetic character of the structure (or portion thereof) proposed for demolition. They shall also consider: (1) the structural integrity (i.e., condition) of the structure and (2) the integrity of materials, location, and design of the structure. No application for demolition shall be approved solely on the basis of a structure's deteriorated condition where the Board determines that the applicant is primarily responsible for the deteriorated condition. Finally, the Board shall consider the extent to which demolition would, in the judgment of the Board, produce a detrimental effect upon the character of the structure or property affected or upon the surrounding properties, or upon the district in which the structure is located. No application for demolition of a Landmark shall be approved. 
4.  Specific Guidelines. The Board shall adopt additional guidelines, subject to review and approval by City Council, consistent with this Chapter for reviewing applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
K.  Refiling of an Application. If an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness is denied, the application may not be considered by the Board again for one year unless the applicant can demonstrate to the Board a substantial change in circumstances relevant to the application. 
5.2.4. - Demolition or Relocation. 
A.  Certificate of Appropriateness Required. 
1.  No structure within an Historic District or Historic Site (Ord. 04142003A) shall be demolished or relocated until the owner thereof has applied for and received a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Board. 
2.  The Board may delay the granting of the Certificate for a period of up to 60 days from the time of the filing of the application. The Board may extend this postponement for another 180 days after a public hearing and finding by the Board that the structure or landmark is of historical, architectural, or archeological importance to the public or City of Aiken. Within any period of postponement, the Board shall endeavor to ascertain what may be done to preserve the structure or landmark. Such steps shall include, but are not limited to, consultation with civic groups, interested citizens, public interest groups, and public boards and agencies. 
3.  After the postponement period has ended and the Board has been unable to determine a reasonable alternative to demolition or relocation, the Certificate shall be granted after a public hearing, with the notice required by 5.2.3.D being given. However, if the Board finds that the structure contributes to the character of the Historic District or that the landmark is of historical, archeological, or architectural significance or that, for any other reason, preservation in the public interest is warranted, the application shall be denied. In the event of such denial, the owner may apply for an exception under 5.1.3. 
B.  Demolition by Neglect. The following provisions shall take effect six months after the effective date of this Ordinance. 
1.  Prevention of Demolition by Neglect of Exterior. No owner or person with an interest in real property which is designated an Historic Site (Ord. 04142003A) in any part of the City or any property in an Historic District, whether that property is occupied or not, shall permit the structure or property to fall into a serious state of disrepair or to remain in a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgment of the Board, produce a detrimental effect upon the character of the structure or property, or, if the structure or property is in an Historic District, upon the district. Examples of such deterioration include: 
a.  deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports; 
b.  deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members; 
c.  deterioration of exterior chimneys; 
d.  deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar; 
e.  ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or foundations, including broken windows or doors; 
f.  deterioration of any exterior feature so as to create a hazardous condition which could make demolition necessary for the public safety; or 
g.  deterioration or removal of any unique exterior architectural feature which would detract from the original architectural style. 
2.  Prevention of Demolition by Neglect of Interior. No owner or person with an interest in real property which is designated an Historic Site (Ord. 04142003A) in any part of the City, or any property in an Historic District, whether that property is occupied or not, shall permit the interior portions of such structure or property to fall into a serious state of disrepair which, in the judgment of the Board, produces a detrimental effect upon the structural integrity of such structure or property which could make demolition necessary for the public safety.

1.  Required Findings. A variance may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals if the Board concludes that the strict enforcement of any design and performance standard set forth in this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of this Ordinance will be observed, public health, safety, and welfare will not be diminished, and substantial justice will be done. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board determines and expresses in writing all of the following findings. 
a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property; and 
b.  These conditions do not generally apply to other properties in the vicinity; and 
c.  Due to these conditions, the application of the Ordinance to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; and 
d.  The conditions are not the result of the applicant's own actions; and 
e.  Granting of the variance would not substantially conflict with the Comprehensive Plan and the purposes of this Ordinance; and 
f.  The authorization of the variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance. 
2.  Limitations. The Board may not grant a variance the effect of which would be any of the following. 
a.  To permit a use of land or a structure that is not allowed in the applicable district. 
b.  To allow an increase in intensity or physical extension of a nonconforming use. 
c.  To increase the density of a use above that permitted by the applicable district. 
3.  Profitability Not to Be Considered. The fact that property may be developed more profitably should a variance be granted may not be considered grounds for a variance. 
4.  Hardship Due to Eminent Domain. Where the alleged hardship results from the taking of part of the property by eminent domain, thus reducing the land area available for parking, buffers, and other purposes, the applicant shall have the burden of proving that, after good-faith efforts by the applicant or previous owner, the condemning authority failed or refused to provide the applicant compensation adequate to cover the value of both the land actually taken and the economic impacts of the reduction in the size of the remaining property. Only if the applicant meets this burden of proof will a hardship under these conditions be considered adequate to justify the granting of a variance. 
D.  Expiration of Approval. A variance shall expire on the date specified by the Board of Zoning Appeals in the approval, but not less than two years from approval, or two years after the date of the approval hearing where no date is specified, unless the applicant submits a complete site plan review application, or building permit application where no site plan is required.

C.  Criteria for Approval of Variances. 
1.  Required Findings. A variance may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals if the Board concludes that the strict enforcement of any design and performance standard set forth in this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of this Ordinance will be observed, public health, safety, and welfare will not be diminished, and substantial justice will be done. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board determines and expresses in writing all of the following findings. 
a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property; and 
b.  These conditions do not generally apply to other properties in the vicinity; and 
c.  Due to these conditions, the application of the Ordinance to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; and 
d.  The conditions are not the result of the applicant's own actions; and 
e.  Granting of the variance would not substantially conflict with the Comprehensive Plan and the purposes of this Ordinance; and 
f.  The authorization of the variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance. 
2.  Limitations. The Board may not grant a variance the effect of which would be any of the following. 
a.  To permit a use of land or a structure that is not allowed in the applicable district. 
b.  To allow an increase in intensity or physical extension of a nonconforming use. 
c.  To increase the density of a use above that permitted by the applicable district. 
3.  Profitability Not to Be Considered. The fact that property may be developed more profitably should a variance be granted may not be considered grounds for a variance. 
4.  Hardship Due to Eminent Domain. Where the alleged hardship results from the taking of part of the property by eminent domain, thus reducing the land area available for parking, buffers, and other purposes, the applicant shall have the burden of proving that, after good-faith efforts by the applicant or previous owner, the condemning authority failed or refused to provide the applicant compensation adequate to cover the value of both the land actually taken and the economic impacts of the reduction in the size of the remaining property. Only if the applicant meets this burden of proof will a hardship under these conditions be considered adequate to justify the granting of a variance. 
D.  Expiration of Approval. A variance shall expire on the date specified by the Board of Zoning Appeals in the approval, but not less than two years from approval, or two years after the date of the approval hearing where no date is specified, unless the applicant submits a complete site plan review application, or building permit application where no site plan is required.

B.  Deadline for Submission of Application. An application for appeal shall be filed (received by the Planning Director or postmarked) not later than 15 days after the decision being appealed in order to be considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
