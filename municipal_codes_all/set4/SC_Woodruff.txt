City of Woodruff Zoning Ordinance
ARTICLE IX BUFFERYARDS
Section I General Provision
1. The purpose of the bufferyard is to ameliorate the relationship between adjacent land uses including:
a. minimizing nuisances
b. promoting compatibility.
2. The bufferyard offers several options, each of which will buffer to an equivalent degree by varying distance (setback) and/or density (mass).
3. Definition. A bufferyard is a permanent unit of land, together with planting, fences, berms, walls, and other screening devices required thereon.
4. Bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. Bufferyards shall not be located on any portion of an existing public or private right-of-way.
5. Determination of Bufferyard Requirements. To determine the bufferyard required between two adjacent parcels, the following procedure shall be followed:
a. Identify the proposed land use;
b. Identify the use of lands adjacent to the proposed use;
6. Determine the bufferyard required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the proposed land use by referring to the Table of Bufferyard Requirements and Illustrations contained in Appendix B, which specify the bufferyard options required between a proposed use and the existing adjacent uses.
7. Responsibility for Bufferyard/Screening. A buffer shall be required along any property line that borders a property of less intense zoning, as specified in this Ordinance.
8. Bufferyard Specifications. The illustrations in this section specify the type and quantity of plant materials required by each bufferyard. The requirements are stated in terms of width of the bufferyard and the number of plants required per 100 feet of bufferyard. The requirements of a bufferyard may be specified by any one of the options illustrated. The "plant unit multiplier" is a factor by which the basic number of plant materials required for a given bufferyard is determined given a change in the width of that yard. Each illustration depicts the total bufferyard required between two uses. Whenever a wall, fence, or berm is required within a bufferyard, these are shown as "structures" in the following illustrations wherein their respective specifications also are shown.
The exact placement of required plants shall be the decision of the developer except that evergreen (or conifer) plant materials shall be planted in clusters rather than singly in order to maximize their chances of survival and increase screening.
All bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn grass or suitable ground cover.
79
City of Woodruff Zoning Ordinance
9. Minimum Plant Size. Plants shall be sufficiently sized to insure buffering and screening at the time of installation. Where the Bufferyard Illustration indicate a mass or line of plants parallel the length of the property line, the plant materials shall be sufficiently sized to insure obscurity at the time of installation. However, seeding plants may be used where berms or structures are required as part of the bufferyard.

10. Bufferyard Substitutions.
a. Any existing healthy, well-formed plant materials which are greater than or equal to the recommended buffer and which otherwise satisfy the requirements of this section may be counted towards satisfying all such requirements.
b. Structures, where required, may be substituted with approval of the Planning Commission.
11. Use of Bufferyards. A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation; however, no plant material may be removed and such use shall not be a nuisance.
12. Containers and Dumpsters. All exterior dumpsters or exterior garbage containers (excluding containers of groups of containers with a combined capacity of less than six cubic yards) shall be screened on all but one side by a fence or wall, intensive landscaping, or other suitable opaque enclosure. The average height of the enclosure shall be one (1) foot more than the height of the container but shall not be required to exceed eight (8) feet in height. The open side shall not be visible from the street.
13. Fences and Walls - Appearance. All fences and walls used as part of the bufferyard requirements must have a finished side facing adjoining property. The interior side of the fence or wall may be finished as the owner deems appropriate. Where fences or walls are applicable bufferyard requirements, they shall be established along the inside line of the bufferyard, toward the proposed use, except for ornamental fences, which may be built on the property line.
14. Berms. Where required, berms may be located anywhere within the bufferyard, provided they parallel the property line.
15. Required Maintenance. The maintenance of required bufferyards shall be the responsibility of the property owner. And all such yards shall be properly maintained so as to assure continued buffering. Failure to do so is a violation of this Ordinance, and may be remedied in the manner prescribed for violations.

These guidelines serve as the basis for determining the approval, approval with modifications, or denial of an application. The Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation are:
(1) A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
