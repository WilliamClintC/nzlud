PERSONNEL POLICIES
§ 47-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Personnel
Administration Ordinance of 1986."
§ 47-2. Declaration of policy.
It is hereby the declared personnel administration policy of the Township of
Concord that:
§ 47-3. Drug and Alcohol Policy. [Added 2-4-1997 by Ord. No. 208]
A. Employment in the township government shall be based on merit and
fitness, free of personal and political considerations.
B. Just and equitable incentives and conditions of employment shall be
established and maintained to promote efficiency and economy in the
operation of the township government.
C. Positions having similar duties and responsibilities shall be classified
and compensated on a uniform basis and shall be adopted by resolution
of the Board of Supervisors of Concord Township and may be amended
from time to time by resolution.
D. A wage schedule shall be adopted by resolution and may be amended
from time to time by resolution.

and by every consideration of the rights and interests of employees,
consistent with the best interest of the public and the township.
H. Tenure of employees covered by this chapter shall be subject to good
behavior, the satisfactory performance of work, the necessity of the
performance of work and the availability of funds.
A. Policy objectives. The township has a desire to provide a safe workplace
for its employees and efficient service to the public. The township's
objective in adopting this Drug and Alcohol Policy is to comply with
applicable state and federal law and to help ensure that the workplace
is free from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol use and that
employees are fit to perform their job duties and report for work
regularly and on time.
§ 45-7 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 47-3
47:37
B. Regulations concerning testing. The United States Department of
Transportation (DOT) has established mandatory drug and alcohol
testing regulations that affect certain of the township's drivers and
driver applicants. The township is committed to complying with these
federal regulations and to applying certain of such federal regulations
to all township employees and employment applicants. Accordingly, the
following requirements shall apply to all employees who are required to
have a commercial driver's license (CDL) and to applicants for CDL
positions and, where indicated, to all township employees and
applicants for employment.
(1) Preemployment testing. All applicants for employment with the
township shall be tested for controlled substances before
beginning employment with the township. An applicant who tests
positive for controlled substances shall not be hired by the
township.
(2) Random testing. If the township does its own testing, then each
year CDL drivers holding a minimum of 25% of the average number
of CDL driver positions shall undergo random alcohol testing and
CDL drivers holding at least 50% of the average number of CDL
driver positions shall undergo random controlled substances
testing. If the township joins a testing consortium, then those
minimum percentages shall apply to the total pool of CDL drivers
whose employers are part of the consortium. The CDL driver may
be tested at any time during working hours, before, during or after
performing job duties, and the test will be unannounced.
(3) Reasonable-suspicion testing.
(a) The township shall require an employee to submit to an alcohol
and/or controlled substances test when the township has
reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee is under the
influence of alcohol and/or controlled substances or has
otherwise violated the regulations set forth in this Drug and
Alcohol Policy. When the township has reasonable suspicion to
believe that the employee is under the influence of alcohol and/
or controlled substances or has otherwise violated this policy,
the township shall be permitted to search the vehicle and
personal property of such employee during working hours or
whenever the employee is on the township's property or is at
his or her designated workplace. Reasonable suspicion must be
based on specific observations concerning the appearance,
behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. Township
supervisors or officials will be trained to recognize the
indicators of probable controlled substances or alcohol misuse.
The person who makes the determination that reasonable
suspicion exists shall not conduct the drug or alcohol test.
(b) Within two hours after the determination of reasonable
suspicion is made, the employee shall be tested for alcohol and/
§ 47-3 CONCORD CODE § 47-3
47:38
or controlled substances. If the alcohol and/or controlled
substances test is not administered within two hours after
the determination of reasonable suspicion is made, then the
township shall record why the test was not promptly
administered. Under no circumstances shall the employee be
tested for alcohol later than eight hours after the
determination of reasonable suspicion is made or for controlled
substances later than 32 hours after the determination of
reasonable suspicion is made.
(c) A written record shall be made of the observations leading to
an alcohol and/or controlled substances reasonable suspicion
test and shall be signed by the supervisor or township official
who made the observations within 24 hours of the observed
behavior or before the results of the alcohol or controlled
substances test are released, whichever is earlier.
(d) The township will not permit any employee to perform any
safety-sensitive duties after a reasonable suspicion
determination has been made and prior to receipt by the
township of final test results confirming that the employee is
not under the influence of controlled substances or alcohol as
established by the DOT regulations or other applicable law.
Depending on the availability of work, the township will
determine whether to reassign the employee to non-safetysensitive
work or to place the employee on leave without pay. If
the test results are negative for controlled substances and/or
alcohol as established by the DOT regulations or other
applicable law and if the employee had been placed on leave
without pay, then the employee will be paid for the time he
would have worked pending receipt of the test results.
(4) Mandatory postaccident testing.
(a) Within two hours after an accident, as defined herein, an
employee shall be tested for alcohol and controlled substances.
If an alcohol and controlled substances test is not administered
within two hours after the accident, the township shall record
why the test was not promptly administered. Under no
circumstances shall an employee be tested for alcohol later
than eight hours after the accident or for controlled substances
later than 32 hours after the accident.
(b) An accident is defined as involving:
[1] A fatality.
[2] The employee receiving a citation under state or local law
for a moving violation, which violation occurs during
working hours.
§ 47-3 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 47-3
47:39
[3] Bodily injury that requires a person to be transported
away from the scene for medical treatment.
[4] Damage to any vehicle that requires the vehicle to be
towed away from the scene by a tow truck or another
vehicle, or other substantial damage to any property.
[5] Any job-related incident involving the apparent violation of
a safety rule or standard, which did or could have resulted
in serious injury or property damage.
(c) An employee who is subject to postaccident testing shall
remain readily available for such testing or else may be
deemed by the township to have refused to submit to testing.
Refusal to submit to controlled substances testing will be
considered an act of insubordination, with disciplinary and
employment consequences. However, this availability
requirement does not require the employee to delay necessary
medical attention for himself, herself or others or to delay
obtaining assistance as needed due to the accident. If, as a
consequence of an accident, an employee is seriously injured
and cannot provide a specimen at the time of the accident, the
employee must provide the necessary authorization for
obtaining hospital records and other documents that will
indicate whether there were any controlled substances or
alcohol in his or her system at the time of the accident. After an
accident, an employee may not consume alcohol or any
controlled substances before being tested.
(5) Return-to-duty testing. Before an employee may, if at all, return to
duty after testing positive for alcohol or controlled substances, the
employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test which
indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 and a return-toduty
controlled substances test which verifies a negative result for
controlled substances as set forth in the DOT regulations or other
applicable law.
(6) Follow-up testing. An employee who returns to duty after testing
positive for the use of alcohol and/or controlled substances shall be
subject to unannounced follow-up testing for up to 60 months from
the date of the employee's return to duty. The employee shall be
subject to a minimum of six unannounced alcohol and/or controlled
substances tests during the first 12 months following his or her
return to duty. Follow-up tests may be conducted at any time during
working hours, before, during or after performing job duties.
(7) Testing procedures. Tests and testing procedures for alcohol and/or
controlled substances, including but not limited to blood and urine
testing, evidentiary breath testing and blood alcohol testing, shall
comply with applicable DOT regulations and other applicable law.
Controlled substances include but are not limited to cocaine,
§ 47-3 CONCORD CODE § 47-3
47:40
marijuana, opiates (including heroin), amphetamines,
phencyclidine (PCP) and prescription drugs that adversely affect
the driver's ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle
and any other substance defined as a controlled substance under
applicable law. Blood alcohol testing may be used in reasonable
suspicion and postaccident testing where an evidentiary breath
test (EBT) is not readily available. Blood alcohol testing may also
be performed if the employee is unable to provide sufficient breath
for a breath test.
C. Administration and recordkeeping.
(1) Notification of test results. The township will notify each
employment applicant (upon request) and each employee of the
results of alcohol and/or controlled substances tests of the
applicant or employee conducted pursuant to the DOT regulations
and other applicable law. Employees who test positive will also be
advised specifically as to what drug or the amount of alcohol that
was discovered.
(2) Recordkeeping. The township shall comply with the DOT's
recordkeeping regulations. All of the records relating to the
administration and results of the township's alcohol and controlled
substances testing program for its employees shall be maintained
for a minimum period of five years, except that individual negative
test results shall be maintained for a minimum of one year. At its
discretion, the township may delegate the recordkeeping and
reporting requirements to an outside agency or testing consortium.
(3) Medical Review Officer. The township will utilize a Medical Review
Officer who is a licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathy with
knowledge of drug abuse disorders to review drug test results. The
Medical Review Officer shall retain the reports of individual test
results for a minimum of five years.
(4) Access to test results and findings. No person may obtain the
individual test results retained by the township and the township's
designated Medical Review Officer, and neither the township nor
any Medical Review Officer shall release the individual test results
of any employee to any person, except to the tested individual, to
agents of the township, to persons to whom disclosure is necessary
for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions and as required
or permitted by law, without first obtaining written authorization
from the tested individual.
D. General regulations concerning use, possession and sale of alcohol or
controlled substances on the township's property.
(1) All employees shall be subject to discipline pursuant to this policy,
including but not limited to termination, for any of the following

immediately discharged for a second violation of this
policy.
(d) Any employee deemed to have violated this policy a second
time may be discharged.
(e) Anything in this policy to the contrary, notwithstanding if any

Leave Act and other applicable law.
(c) Employees requesting to return to work from any leave of
absence for controlled substance or alcohol abuse shall be

B. The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Concord determines that
such activities and conduct in establishments dealing in alcoholic
beverages contribute to undesirable behavior and create disturbances
that are injurious to the citizens of the Township of Concord.
C. The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Concord believes that this
article is necessary:
(1) To enhance the quality of life within the township;
(2) To promote a climate conducive to the harmonious growth and
development of the township and to the soundness of the economic
base of the township;
(3) To preserve and stabilize the township's neighborhoods;
(4) To protect property values;
(5) To prevent blight and the deterioration of the township's
neighborhoods; and
(6) To decrease the incidence of crime, disorderly conduct and other
secondary effects of adult entertainment when occurring in
establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages, which secondary
effects adversely impact on the health, safety and general welfare
concerns of the Township of Concord.
D. The Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of
America gives the states, including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(the "commonwealth"), broad powers to regulate alcohol and, in such
regulation of alcohol, confers more than the normal state authority over
public health, welfare and morals.
E. The commonwealth's broad powers under the Twenty-First Amendment
to regulate alcohol applies to, inter alia, alcoholic liquors, alcohol and
malt brewed beverages; amending, revising, consolidating and
changing the laws relating thereto; regulating and restricting the
manufacture, purchase, sale, possession, consumption, importation,
transportation, furnishing, holding in bond, holding in storage, traffic in
and use of alcoholic liquors, alcoholic and malt brewed beverages and

option and repealing existing laws.
F. The commonwealth's broad powers under the Twenty-First Amendment
extend equally to establishments that are licensed by the
commonwealth to sell alcoholic beverages and to establishments that
are not licensed by the commonwealth which deal in alcoholic
beverages.
G. The commonwealth has delegated certain of its powers under the
Twenty-First Amendment to municipalities, cities, boroughs,
incorporated towns or townships of this commonwealth, including the
Township of Concord.
H. Among the certain powers of the commonwealth under the Twenty-First
Amendment delegated to the Township of Concord are the powers to:
(1) Prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within township limits
pursuant to a vote of the local electorate; and
(2) Prohibit any and all amusements in establishments licensed by the
commonwealth to sell alcoholic beverages.
I. The commonwealth's power of prohibition under the Twenty-First
Amendment that has been delegated to the Township of Concord
includes the lesser power to regulate.
J. Nothing in the commonwealth's Liquor Code, 47 P.S. § 1-101 et seq.,
shall be construed to preempt the right of the Township of Concord to
enforce any local ordinances and codes dealing with health and welfare
issues.

or is intended to be mixed, combined with or drunk in connection or
combination with an alcoholic beverage on the premises of said business or
commercial establishment; or business or commercial establishment where
the consumption of alcoholic beverages is permitted. A private residence,
whether permanent or temporary in nature, is not an establishment dealing
in alcoholic beverages.

without limitation, the human male genitals in a discernibly turgid
state, even if covered; pubic area; vulva; anus; anal cleft or cleavage;

alcoholic beverages. For purposes of this subsection, the term
"buttocks" shall include the area at the rear of the body which lies
between two imaginary lines running parallel to the ground when a
person is standing, the first or top such line drawn at the top of the
cleavage of the nates (i.e., the prominence formed by the muscles
running from the back of the hip to the back of the leg) and the second
or bottom line drawn at the lowest visible point of this cleavage or the
lowest point of the curvature of the fleshy protuberance, whichever is
lower, and between two imaginary lines on each side of the body, which
lines are perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines
described above and which perpendicular lines are drawn through the
point at which each nate meets the outer side of each leg. This article
would be violated, therefore, if any portion of this area is visible from
any vantage point.

B. No female shall expose to public view any portion of the breast below a
horizontal line across the top of the areola, at its highest point, or

ARTICLE III
Adult Entertainment Businesses
[Adopted 11-7-1995 as Ord. No. 201]
§ 70-9. Purpose.
§ 70-10. Findings.
The Board of Supervisors finds:
A. Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township Code25
to prohibit nuisances, to promote the health, cleanliness, comfort and
safety of the citizens of Concord Township and to regulate the time of
opening and closing and the conduct of places of public entertainment,
amusement and recreation, the Township of Concord enacts this article
to minimize and control the adverse effects of adult entertainment
businesses and thereby to protect the health, safety and welfare of its
citizens, protect the citizens from increased crime, preserve the quality
of life, preserve the property values and character of surrounding
neighborhoods and deter the spread of blight.
B. The Board of Supervisors has determined that locational criteria alone
does not adequately protect the health, safety and general welfare of
the people of the township and that licensing is a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to
ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be
used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
C. The Board of Supervisors does not intend this article to suppress any
speech activities protected by the First Amendment but to enact a
content-neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of
adult entertainment businesses.
A. And it adopts by reference the adverse secondary effects of adult
entertainment businesses presented in hearings and in reports and
adopted as part of Township Ordinance No. 200, enacted November 7,
1995.26
B. That the finding noted in Subsection A above raises substantial
governmental concerns.
C. That adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those
substantial governmental concerns.
D. That a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the
25.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 65101 et seq.
26.Editor's Note: See Ch. 210, Zoning, §§ 210-119C, 210-127C, 210-136C, 210-144C,
210-152C, 210-238A(4) and 210-238E.
§ 70-9 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT § 70-10

§ 70-11. Definitions.
operators of the adult entertainment businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on
the operators to see that the adult entertainment business is run in a
manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and
employees, as well as the citizens of the township. It is appropriate to
require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator
of the adult entertainment business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
E. That the removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult theaters.
F. That requiring licensees of adult entertainment businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees
will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by
facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by
preventing minors from working in such establishments.
G. That the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the adult
entertainment business, where such information is substantially related
to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses,
will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
H. That it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain
employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is
designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
I. That the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption
that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of
this article.
J. That the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
K. That the general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the
township will be promoted by the enactment of this article.
A. The defined terms in Chapter 210, Zoning, § 210-152C, are hereby
adopted by reference and include the definitions of adult arcade; adult
bookstore, adult novelty store or adult video store; adult cabaret; adult
motion-picture theater; adult theater; employee; escort; escort agency;
establishment; nude model studio; nudity or a state of nudity; person;

§ 87-3. Numbering system.
A. Upon all streets extending east and west, the numbering system shall
commence at the eastern boundary of the township, with the number
"one" or an appropriate larger number for streets whose beginning
point extends beyond the township boundary, and shall increase
westwardly therefrom. The allotment of numbers shall be made as
nearly as practicable using or allotting separate numbers for each 40
feet for each side of street frontage. On all such streets, the odd
numbers shall be on the north side and the even numbers on the south
side thereof.

each 40 feet for each side of street frontage. On all such streets, the odd
numbers shall be on the east side and the even numbers on the west
side thereof.
C. Upon all streets not running in a generally north-south or east-west
direction or in any way not conforming to the general pattern of street

building occupied by other than the owner thereof, the occupant, in addition
to the owner, shall be responsible for maintaining the number upon such
building as hereby required.

A. The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Concord finds and
determines that extensive unregulated excavation, removal, relocation

§ 98-2. Permission required.
No person shall excavate or otherwise remove any earth, soil, sand, gravel,
clay, rock or any other similar earth materials (herein referred to as "soil")
for sale or for use other than on the premises from which the soil shall be
taken without first having procured permission therefor from the Board of
Supervisors. This chapter shall not apply to the removal or sale of 1,000
cubic yards or less of soil incidental to the construction or alteration of
a building on any premises, provided that permission for such removal is
secured by the Building Inspector when the permit for the construction or
alteration of such building is secured.
§ 98-3. Application procedure.
The Board of Supervisors shall not consider any application for the removal
of soil from the premises for sale or otherwise unless and until the owner
of the premises shall first file with the Township Secretary a written
application requesting such permission, together with a map of the
premises prepared by a registered surveyor or engineer, showing the
contour lines and grades resulting from such intended removal of soil in
relation to the topography of the premises, and said proposed contour line,
proposed finished grades and an estimate of the amount of soil, in cubic
yards, to be removed, all of which shall be subject to the inspection and
approval of the Board of Supervisors. No such permission for soil removal
shall be issued until the proposed contour lines and grades have been
approved by the Board of Supervisors.
§ 98-4. Hearing.
and filling of soil within the township can result in conditions
detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the populace.
B. Such unregulated practices can result in the following conditions in the
township:
(1) The presence of declivities and pits which retard the normal
drainage of surface water and provide breeding places for
mosquitoes and other harmful vermin.
(2) The permanent destruction of the plant-growing capability of land
from which the soil has been removed.
(3) The increased potential for the destruction by wind and water
erosion of land adjacent to premises stripped of soil.
(4) The depression of the market value of adjacent land for either
agricultural or development purposes because of the blighted
appearance of the denuded land.
C. Such soil-stripping practices will result in the destruction of the taxable
wealth of the township and retard the ability of the township to supply
necessary community services and facilities to its constituents.
§ 98-1 EXCAVATION AND SOIL REMOVAL § 98-4
98:109
§ 98-5. Removal of soil.
If permission to remove the soil shall be granted, the owner shall so conduct
the operations that there shall be no sharp declivities, pits or depressions
and in such a manner that the area shall be properly leveled off, cleared
of debris and graded to conform with the contour lines and grades as
approved by the Board of Supervisors. The soil removal operation shall not
be permitted within 60 feet of any property line other than a public street
or traveled right-of-way.
§ 98-6. Removal of topsoil.
The owner of the premises, when permission has been duly granted, shall
not remove from the premises the top layer of arable soil to a depth of eight
inches, but such top layer of arable soil to a depth of eight inches shall
be set aside for retention on the premises and shall be respread over the
premises when the rest of the soil has been removed, pursuant to grades
and contour lines approved by the Board of Supervisors, and seeded with
perennial grasses or other appropriate ground cover.
A. A hearing before the Board of Supervisors shall be granted to an
applicant for permission to remove soil within 30 days after the
applicant requests such a hearing. The Board of Supervisors, in
considering and reviewing the application and in arriving at its
decision, shall be guided and take into consideration the public health,
safety or general welfare, and particular consideration shall be given to
the following factors:
(1) Soil erosion by water and wind.
(2) Drainage.
(3) Soil fertility.
(4) Lateral support slopes and grades of abutting streets and lands.
(5) Land values and land uses.
(6) Such other factors that may relate to the public health, safety or
general welfare.
B. If, after examining the application and the map provided for in § 98-3
and after the hearing in the event that a hearing is requested by the
applicant, the Board of Supervisors is of the opinion that the proposed
soil removal will not create conditions inimical to the public health,
welfare or safety and will not result in the creation of any sharp
declivities, pits or depressions, soil erosion or fertility problems or
depressed land values nor create any drainage, sewerage problems or
other conditions of danger, then permission to remove the soil under
the terms of this chapter shall be granted.
§ 98-4 CONCORD CODE § 98-7

the owner shall file with the Board of Supervisors a bond, in form and with
surety acceptable to the Township of Concord, in such amount as, in the
opinion of the Township Board of Supervisors, shall be sufficient to insure
the faithful performance of the work to be undertaken pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter.
§ 98-8. Permit required; fee.35
No excavation shall be made and no soil shall be removed under the
provisions of this chapter, unless a permit therefor shall have been first
obtained as provided herein, and no excavation shall be made and no
soil shall be removed except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. At the time of application, a fee to the order of the Township of
Concord, Pennsylvania, shall be paid by the applicant for the permit for
removal of soil from the premises. Said fee shall be in an amount set from
time to time by resolution of the Board of Supervisors, as stated in the
application and certified on the topographical map. In the event of refusal
of the soil removal permit, the fee paid by the applicant shall be refunded,
except that all moneys and costs incurred by the Township of Concord for
engineering surveys and reports, inspection fees and legal fees shall be
retained by the Township, and the balance remaining shall be refunded to
the applicant, together with a statement of the costs and expenses incurred
by the township.

Solid Waste Disposal
[Adopted 1-4-1988 by Ord. No. 158]
§ 142-1. Findings.
A. The municipality (as hereinafter defined) finds it necessary to regulate
the collection of municipal solid waste (as hereinafter defined)
generated within its boundaries in order to protect the public health,
safety and welfare of its taxpayers and residents.
B. Act No. 180 of July 12, 1972, 53 P.S. § 481 et seq.,44 authorizes a
municipality to enter into joint cooperation agreements with other
municipalities in the exercise or in the performance of their respective
governmental functions, powers or responsibilities.
C. The Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act of 1980, as amended,
35 P.S. § 6018.101 et seq. (hereinafter referred to as the "Act"),
authorizes a municipality to require by ordinance that all municipal
wastes generated within its jurisdiction shall be disposed of at a
designated facility.
D. Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Delaware County Council has
caused to be prepared the Delaware County Solid Waste Management
Plan of 1985, which was reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, revised and is dated December, 1986 (the
County Plan), which recommends that for the foreseeable future, the
solid waste from this municipality be disposed of by means of regional
facilities authorized by the county, the Delaware County Solid Waste
Authority and/or the Authority's contractor (hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "county").
E. The County Plan, in February, 1987, received preliminary approval from
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), with
final DEP approval conditional upon the county obtaining such
municipal adoptions of the County Plan as may be necessary for its
implementation.
F. The County Plan concludes that a county-wide solid waste disposal
system should include a resources recovery plant or plants located
within the county because it would be the most environmentally sound
and cost-effective method of disposing of municipal solid waste within
the county.
G. In order to obtain the environmental, economic and public benefits from
the plant or plants as discussed in the County Plan, it is necessary that

occurred from the land prior to development, using woodland as the
prior condition for those portions of the site that have trees of over six
inches DBH (or had such trees within a year prior to application) and
meadowland for all other areas, assuming average antecedent moisture
conditions and a Type II distribution storm under any of the following
storm conditions:
(1) A two-year, twenty-four-hour storm of 3.2 inches of rainfall.
(2) A five-year, twenty-four-hour storm of 4.2 inches of rainfall.
(3) A ten-year, twenty-four-hour storm of 5.0 inches of rainfall.
(4) A twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour storm of 5.7 inches of rainfall.
(5) A fifty-year, twenty-four-hour storm of 6.4 inches of rainfall.
(6) A one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm of 7.12 inches of
rainfall.
B. Storm sewer systems for conveyance of stormwater shall be designed to
a ten-year design storm, except at sumps, in which case the system
shall be sized to carry a twenty-five-year design storm. In addition,
there shall be adequate provision made to safely handle all storms in
excess of the required design storm (up to the one-hundred-year storm)
to prevent significant damage when the system fails. Inundation of
yards or periodic basement flooding is not considered significant
damage. Any bridge or culvert proposed to be within a major streambed
shall be designed to safely carry the one-hundred-year design storm in
conjunction with normal base flow without causing flood or erosion
damage to the surrounding properties. No provisions within this
chapter shall limit or otherwise affect the requirements of the
Floodplain Ordinance.54
C. All plans and designs for stormwater management facilities submitted
to the Township Engineer for approval shall determine stormwater peak
discharge and runoff by the use of the Soil Cover Complex Method, as
set forth in Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release
No. 55, with specific attention given to antecedent moisture conditions,

Hydrology National Engineering Handbook, Section 4, both by United
States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service.
D. In calculating runoff after development, those areas covered by
concrete lattice blocks on an appropriate base, as outlined in Appendix
B, Section II, and roofs which drain to properly designed and installed
seepage beds shall not be considered to be impervious surfaces.
Concrete lattice blocks, seepage beds for roof drainage or similar
provisions to reduce runoff shall be required under the following
conditions:
(1) Whenever total impervious surfaces (buildings, parking areas,
driveways, etc.) will exceed 15% of the lot coverage on a residential
lot, driveways shall be constructed of concrete lattice blocks or
other equivalent provision shall be made to reduce runoff which is
accepted by the Township Engineer.
(2) Whenever total impervious surfaces in a residential land
development will exceed 8% or whenever total impervious surfaces
in other types of land development will exceed 20%, the following
facilities designed in accordance with Appendix B shall be provided
to hold or infiltrate roof drainage:
(a) Infiltration structures.
(b) Detention basins.
(c) Combinations of the above.
E. In order to prevent an increase in the rate of stormwater runoff under
design conditions, the installation of impervious cover shall be effected
only in conformity with the following:
(1) Erosion and sediment control and stormwater management control
facilities shall be incorporated into all building site designs and the
overall design of any subdivision or land development or
improvement so they may serve purposes such as wildlife areas,
recreational areas and fire prevention ponds.
(2) The natural infiltration and water resource potentials of various
soil and geologic formations shall guide design, construction and
vegetation decisions (Appendix A, Section II). Runoff in excess of
natural conditions from roofs, lawn areas and other surfaces which
are unlikely to contain pollutants shall be recharged to the
groundwater table or stored for nonpotable water uses.
(3) All existing trees and shrubs, natural streams, channels, drainage
swales and areas of surface water concentration shall be
maintained in their existing conditions, except where changes can
be justified on the basis of other design standards of this chapter.

ARTICLE IV
Permit Procedures
§ 148-9. Description.
This article describes exemptions from the permit procedure for minor land
disturbance activities which will comply with the performance standards set
forth in Article III and the use of existing plan and permit procedures for
the processing of plans required to accompany applications for stormwater
management permits.
§ 148-10. Exemptions.
All land disturbance activities within Concord Township must comply with
the performance standards set forth in Article III. Certain activities by
their nature will comply with applicable performance standards without the
necessity of specific methods for the control of erosion and sedimentation
or the detention of stormwater runoff, and other activities are too minimal
to require review. While remaining subject to the performance standards,
all such activities are exempted from formal plan submission and permit
requirements. The activities so exempted are:
A. The following minor increases in impervious and semipervious cover on
existing developed properties when such will not exceed the
permissible site coverage provided in Chapter 210, Zoning:
(1) Paving, including brick pavement, additions to existing structures
or construction of new structures, where impervious cover
expansion will not exceed 1,000 square feet. [Amended 4-4-2006
by Ord. No. 300]
(2) Installation of concrete lattice blocks or gravel for driveways,
parking areas or other uses on slopes less than 8% and involving
less than 1,000 square feet of total ground coverage.
(3) Temporary storage of rock, soil or other impervious or pervious
material, where ground contact coverage will not exceed 3% of the
lot size, to a maximum of 4,000 square feet, provided that material
is not placed on slopes exceeding 8% and such storage is not in an
alluvial soils area or in a drainageway.
B. Earthmoving on an existing developed lot up to 10,000 square feet or
10% of the lot, whichever is less, provided that the changes will not
alter drainage patterns, accelerate erosion or interfere with
stormwater control measures previously installed.
C. The following farming activities: dairy farms, horse farms, livestock or
poultry operations, field crops, orchards or combinations thereof,
provided that residences, farm buildings and other impervious surfaces
and livestock confinement areas do not exceed 5% of surface coverage
of the total acreage and operations comply with § 148-7B(2) of this
chapter or a plan has been previously approved by the Township.
§ 148-9 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-10
144:205
§ 148-11. Application requirements.
All land disturbance activities, except those exempted from permit
requirements by § 148-10, shall be conducted only pursuant to and after
the issuance of a land disturbance permit. In all land disturbances involving
land development or the expansion or construction of buildings or other
improvements which will create impervious surfaces, an application shall
be submitted and processed in accordance with § 148-12 or § 148-13, as
appropriate. Applications for permits for land disturbance activities
ancillary either to a subdivision or land development and/or construction
for which a building permit is required shall be submitted to be processed
concurrently with applications for a subdivision or land development or an
application for a building permit, respectively. All other applications for a
land disturbance permit shall be submitted and processed in accordance
with § 148-14.
§ 148-12. Land disturbance ancillary to final approval.
D. Nursery and/or sod operations, provided that:
(1) Operations comply with § 148-7B(3) of this chapter;
(2) Nursery operations are on slopes less than 15%;
(3) Sod operations are on slopes less than 8%, and no more than 30%
of the sod on a contiguous growing area is removed before new sod
is established; and
(4) Buildings and/or impervious surfaces do not exceed 5% surface
coverage of the nursery or sod operation's total acreage at the site.
E. The following woodcutting activities:
(1) Operations complying with § 148-7B(4) of this chapter.
(2) Removal of dead or fallen trees.
F. Home gardens, provided that they do not obstruct with drainage
facilities or cause erosion, sedimentation or runoff on open roadways or
adjacent properties.
A. Concurrently with the submission of an application for final approval of
a subdivision or land development plan involving any nonexempt land
disturbance activities, the applicant shall submit a stormwater
management plan demonstrating that all land disturbance activities
ancillary to the subdivision or land development shall comply with the
performance standards for erosion and sedimentation set forth in
§ 148-7 and for permanent stormwater management set forth in § 148-8
and design requirements set forth in Appendices A and B.
B. The stormwater management plan shall contain all of the information
required by Article V hereof. The applicant and/or his engineer is
§ 148-10 CONCORD CODE § 148-12
144:206
encouraged to confer with the Township Engineer prior to the
preparation of a stormwater management plan.
C. The stormwater management plan shall be reviewed by the Township
Engineer, who shall submit a report thereon to the Township Planning
Commission within 30 days of submission of the plan.
D. If, in the Township Engineer's opinion, the stormwater management
plan, as submitted, satisfies all requirements of this chapter, he shall
recommend its approval by the Planning Commission. The
recommendation shall be considered by the Planning Commission,
together with the results of its own review and the comments of any
other reviewing body, as it reviews the subdivision or land development
application of which the stormwater management plan is a part.
E. If, in the Township Engineer's opinion, the stormwater management
plan, as submitted, fails to satisfy all requirements of this chapter, he
shall indicate so in his report to the Planning Commission and shall
recommend disapproval. Deficiencies shall be specified in terms of
chapter requirements not met.
(1) Upon receipt of the Township Engineer's report recommending
disapproval of the plan, the Planning Commission shall
communicate that finding to the applicant, proposing one of the
three following alternatives:
(a) The applicant shall withdraw the plan, as submitted,
terminating, in writing, the ninety-day review period for the
subdivision or land development plan. A new ninety-day period
will then commence upon the plan's resubmission.
(b) The applicant may, at that point, request, in writing, an
extension beyond the ninety-day period in order to accomplish
revisions as called for in the Township Engineer's report. If
acceptable to the Planning Commission, it shall indicate so, in
writing. If unacceptable to the Planning Commission, the
proposed extension shall not be granted, and the applicant
shall proceed in accordance with either Subsection E(1)(a)
above or Subsection E(1)(c) below.
(c) Revised plan.
[1] Should the applicant feel that, based upon the extent of
revisions needed, a revised plan can be resubmitted to the
Township Engineer sufficiently in advance of the ninetyday
expiration to allow further review by the Township
Engineer and a decision by the Planning Commission, he
shall propose such a course of action. Such proposal shall
specify the time within which the plan will be resubmitted
to the Township and, thus, the review and approval time
that will remain for the Township. If the Planning
Commission concurs in the proposed resubmission
§ 148-12 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-12
144:207
§ 148-13. Land disturbance ancillary to building construction.
schedule, this proposal shall be mutually signed and shall
become the basis for proceeding with the plan review.
[2] Should the applicant fail to resubmit the plan within the
agreed-upon time period, he shall request, in writing, an
extension of the ninety-day review period of sufficient
length to allow completion of the review and decision
process. If agreed to, in writing, by the Township, this
extended period shall be in effect.
(2) The Planning Commission may recommend approval of the
stormwater management plan with conditions to be addressed as
part of the final subdivision or land development application. Such
conditions will be agreed to by the applicant, in writing, prior to
conditional approval. If these conditions are not accepted by the
applicant, the Planning Commission may deny approval of the plan.
F. Final plan approval.
(1) Approval of the final subdivision and land development plan shall
require the applicant to submit all construction specifications for
stormwater management facilities as outlined in this chapter and
by the Township Engineer, a performance guarantee escrow
agreement as outlined in § 148-32, detailed documents necessary
to comply with the maintenance requirements of Article VII and
such other information as is deemed necessary by the Township
Engineer. [Amended 1-5-1998 by Ord. No. 221]
(2) The applicant may request, in writing, the approval of the final
subdivision and land development plan conditioned upon
satisfactory submission of the above. If so, the land disturbance
permit will not be issued at the time of final approval but shall
await satisfaction of conditions. No site work shall begin until all
conditions are met.
G. If the stormwater management plan submission does not comply with
the performance standards set forth in §§ 148-7 and 148-8, the design
requirements of Appendices A and B or other relevant sections of this
chapter, this failure to comply shall be grounds for denial of the
application for subdivision and land development.
H. Where individual on-lot disturbance activities are not specifically
addressed in the applicant's stormwater management plan, the final
subdivision and land development plan shall note thereon that
supplementary individual on-lot stormwater management plans must be
submitted by the applicant or his successors concurrently with
applications for building permits for each lot.
A. Where individual on-lot land disturbance activities have been
addressed, approved and noted as such in the applicant's stormwater
§ 148-12 CONCORD CODE § 148-13
144:208
§ 148-14. Other land disturbance activities.
management plan ancillary to a subdivision and land development,
applications for building permits for each individual lot shall refer to
such approval and it shall not be necessary for the applicant to resubmit
a stormwater management plan concurrently with applications for
building permits, provided that the locations of houses, driveways and
drainage or seepage bed facilities will not appreciably alter the runoff
characteristics of the lot.
B. In all other cases or in cases where an applicant in Subsection A above
wishes to change building locations or the on-lot stormwater
management system, concurrently with the submission of an
application for building permit involving any nonexempt land
disturbance activities, the applicant shall submit a stormwater
management plan demonstrating that all land disturbance activities
ancillary to the building construction shall comply with the
performance standards for erosion and sedimentation set forth in
§ 148-7 and for permanent stormwater management set forth in
§ 148-8.
C. The stormwater management plan shall contain all of the information
required by Article V hereof. However, the applicant and/or his
engineer is encouraged to confer with the Township Engineer prior to
the preparation of stormwater management plan to determine the
scope and detail of the submission.
D. The stormwater management plan shall be reviewed by the Township
Engineer, who shall submit a report thereon within 30 days of
submission of the plan.
E. Where revisions to the plan are necessary in order to meet the
performance standards set forth in §§ 148-7 and 148-8, the applicant is
urged to discuss the contents of the Township Engineer's report with
the Township Engineer. All necessary revisions shall be effected and
submitted within 20 days after issuance of the Township Engineer's
report.
F. Within 10 days after receipt of the applicant's revisions, the Township
Engineer shall review the revisions for compliance with the Engineer's
report and issue a supplementary report.
G. If the stormwater management plan shall not be in compliance with the
performance standards set forth in §§ 148-7 and 148-8, failure to so
comply shall be grounds for denial of the building permit. Approval of
the building permit shall constitute approval of the stormwater
management plan. Where the stormwater management plan is
approved, the land disturbance permit for all land disturbance activities
ancillary to the building construction shall be issued concurrently with
building permit approval.
§ 148-13 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-14
144:209
§ 148-15. Land disturbance permit.
A. Whenever any person engages in nonexempt land disturbance activities

comply shall be grounds for denial of the land disturbance permit.
Issuance of the land disturbance permit shall constitute approval of the
stormwater management plan.
A. Conditions of issuance.
(1) In approving a stormwater management plan and granting a land
disturbance permit, the Township may impose such conditions as it
may deem necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the
community. No permit shall be issued until the owner, builder or
developer applicant of the site certifies, in writing, that all site
work shall be performed in accordance with the plan. The plan shall
§ 148-14 CONCORD CODE § 148-15
144:210
be a condition of the permit and no person shall violate any such
condition so imposed.
(2) Those elements of the overall stormwater management system
designed to retain stormwater and sediment on an individual lot
shall be specifically located on the approved final subdivision or
land development plan that is to be recorded with the Delaware
County Recorder of Deeds. These elements may include:
(a) Maintenance of existing surface drainage systems, swales, etc.
(b) Utilization of groundwater recharge areas, seepage pits,
basins, etc.
(c) Limitations on grading of the lot so as to retain the absorption
capacity of the soil.
(d) Establishment of drainage easements, granted to the
Township, for the protection of existing drainage patterns.
(3) No certificate of occupancy or zoning use approval, whichever is
applicable, shall be granted until all stormwater management
facilities have been satisfactorily installed. As a condition to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the deed shall contain
evidence of appropriate deed restriction placed upon an individual
lot owner, group of lot owners or the obligation placed upon a
homeowners' association for the maintenance of said stormwater
management facilities. Said deed restriction shall require that no
action will be taken by any lot owner(s) or homeowners' association
to disrupt or in any way impair the effectiveness of the system and
that routine maintenance will be undertaken as necessary to
ensure the system's continued functioning. [Amended 1-5-1998
by Ord. No. 221]
B. Expiration and renewal.
(1) Every permit issued hereunder shall expire at the end of the period
of time set out in the permit. The permittee shall fully perform and
complete all of the work required to be done within the time limit
specified in the permit. If the permittee shall be unable to complete
the work within the specified time, he shall, within 30 days prior to
the expiration of the permit, present, in writing, to the Board of
Supervisors a request for an extension of time, setting forth therein
the reasons for the requested extension. If, in the discretion of the
Board and the Township Engineer, such an extension is warranted,
the Board may grant additional time for the completion of the work.
Where the Township Engineer determines that the extension of
time will require a substantial modification of the runoff and
erosion control plan, any extension of a permit shall be subject to
approval of a revised runoff and erosion control plan by him in the
same manner as with an original plan and application.
§ 148-15 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-15
144:211
(2) Permits for agriculture and nursery and sod operations shall be
valid for 10 years, provided that the conditions of the plan and
performance standards are followed and there is no increase in
impervious surfaces, intensification of land use or changes in
drainage.
C. Modification of plans.
(1) Major modifications of the approved application and plans shall be
submitted to the Township Engineer and reprocessed in the same
manner as the original application and plans.
(2) All development must be suspended pending the approval of
modified plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be
authorized by the Township Engineer provided that written
authorization is given to the person performing work pursuant to
the permit.
D. Revocation or suspension. Any permit issued under this chapter may be
revoked or suspended by the Board of Supervisors, after notice, for:
(1) Violation of any condition of the permit;
(2) Violation of any provision of this chapter or any other applicable
law, ordinance, rule or regulation relating to the work;

The Board of Supervisors of Concord Township finds that:
§ 148-34. Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the
Township, implement the requirements of the Chester Creek Stormwater
Management Plan, and implement the requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Phase II (NPDES II) by minimizing
the damages described in § 148-33A of this part through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the Township and all of the people of
the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
A. Manage accelerated runoff, erosion, and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems;
B. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems;
C. Encourage recharge of groundwater where appropriate and prevent
degradation of groundwater quality;
D. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the
Township and the commonwealth;
E. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams;
F. Provide proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management
facilities that are constructed in the Township; and
G. Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershed-wide
stormwater management and planning.

ARTICLE XIII
Drainage Plan Requirements
§ 148-43. Written approval of drainage plan required.
For any of the activities regulated by this part, the final approval of
subdivision and/or land development plans, the issuance of any building or
occupancy permit, or the commencement of any land disturbance activity
may not proceed until the applicant or his/her agent has received written
approval of a drainage plan from the Township.
§ 148-44. Exemptions.
A. A stormwater quantity control exemption, Concord Township (as listed
in Chapter 148, Part 1).
(1) Any regulated activity that meets the following exemption criterion
shall not be required to submit a drainage plan implementing the
stormwater quantity controls of this part. This criterion shall apply
to the total development even if the development is to take place in
phases. The date of the adoption of this part shall be the starting
point from which to consider tracts as "parent tracts" in which
future subdivisions and respective impervious area computations
shall be cumulatively considered. Exemption shall not relieve the
applicant from implementing such measures as are necessary to
protect health, safety, and property.
(2) Stormwater management exemption criterion: no more than 1,000
square feet of impervious surface. [Amended 4-4-2006 by Ord.
No. 300]
B. Applicants whose activities are exempted under Subsection A above
shall still be required to meet the stormwater management quality
controls of this part. This may be achieved by implementing one or
more of the following minimum best management practices:
(1) Provide infiltration capacity for the equivalent of one inch of runoff
from all new impervious surfaces. The infiltration volume does not
have to be provided in one location. However, if site conditions
preclude capture of runoff from portions of the impervious area,
the infiltration volume for the remaining area must be increased an
equivalent amount to offset the loss. In no case should the portion
of the new impervious area flowing to an infiltration facility be less
than 90% of the total new impervious area.
(2) If site conditions preclude use of infiltration facilities (e.g., high
groundwater table or extensive rock conditions), provide an
extended detention facility that will detain the equivalent of one
inch of runoff from all new impervious areas for at least 24 hours.
(3) Provide buffer areas on the downstream side of any new impervious
surfaces (e.g., sidewalks, roadways, parking lots) where the runoff
§ 148-43 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-44
144:243
§ 148-45. Plan submission.
discharges in a sheet flow manner. The buffer areas must be at
least 20 feet wide and can be a mix of grass, shrubs, and trees.
If buffer areas cannot be provided for the entire length of the
impervious surfaces, consider installing a bioretention system and
diverting surface runoff from the impervious surfaces to the facility
using grass swales.
(4) If none of the above options are feasible due to site constraints, the
applicant must provide stormwater detention that meets the
release rate criteria for the site location or else obtain approval
from the Township Engineer to implement other BMPs that will
provide water quality benefits of an equivalent level.
C. New federal regulations approved October 1999 require operators of
small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) to obtain NPDES
Phase II permits from DEP by March 2003. (NPDES II is an acronym for
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Phase II
Stormwater Permitting Regulations.) This program affects all
municipalities in urbanized areas of the state. This definition applies to
all of the Chester Creek Watershed and/or Concord Township.
Therefore, all municipalities within the Chester Creek Watershed will
be subject to the NPDES Phase II requirements, mandated by the
Federal Clean Water Act as administered by DEP. For more information
on NPDES II requirements, contact the DEP Regional Office.
D. Concord Township does not currently have or contemplate a municipal
separate storm sewer system.
A. For all activities regulated by this part, the steps below shall be
followed for submission. For any activities that require a DEP joint
permit application and are regulated under Chapter 105 (Dam Safety
and Waterway Management) or Chapter 106 (Floodplain Management)
of DEPs Rules and Regulations, require a PennDOT highway occupancy
permit, or require any other permit under applicable state or federal
regulations, the permit(s) shall be part of the plan.
B. Five copies of the drainage plan and associated plan review application
shall be submitted by the applicant as part of the Act 247 preliminary
plan submission for the regulated activity. Distribution of the drainage
plan will be as follows:
(1) Two copies to the Township accompanied by the requisite Township
review fee, as specified in this part.

Stormwater Management
§ 148-50. General procedures for water quality and quantity
control.
§ 148-51. Stormwater management districts.
The Chester Creek Watershed is divided into districts that represent three
levels of stormwater management. The boundaries of the stormwater
management districts are shown on an official release rate map, included
as part of the Chester Creek Stormwater Management Plan (see Plate 1,
Release Rate Map). A copy of the official release rate map at a reduced
scale is included as Plate 1 in Appendix A of this part.60 This map is for
reference only. The exact location of the stormwater management district
boundaries as they apply to a given development site must be determined
by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours (or the
most accurate data required) provided as part of the drainage plan.
A. All regulated activities in the Chester Creek Watershed which do not
fall under the exemption criterion shown in § 148-44 shall submit a
drainage plan consistent with the Chester Creek Stormwater
Management Plan to the Township for review. This criterion shall apply
to the total proposed development even if development is to take place
in stages. Impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to, any roof,
parking, or driveway areas and any new streets and sidewalks. Any
areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed
to be impervious.
B. Drainage plans shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions
contained in this article. The process for implementing these provisions
is illustrated in Figure 4-1, Water Quality and Quantity Control
Drainage Plan Preparation Procedures.59
C. The Chester Creek Stormwater Management Plan requires water
quality and water quantity controls as illustrated on the flow chart
shown in Figure 4-1 and detailed in § 148-53. The flow chart illustrates
a three-step hierarchical process: Step 1, infiltration, Step 2, extended
detention, and Step 3, implementation of additional design controls.
Applicants must evaluate the outcome of each step before proceeding
to the next. In addition, riparian buffers are required where applicable,
in accordance with § 148-53A(2).
D. Applicants are highly encouraged to meet the postdevelopment peak
discharge control criteria indicated in §§ 148-51 and 148-52 through
use of BMPs and innovative site designs that minimize the amount of
new impervious surface.

shalt not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified on the official stormwater management
release rate map, Appendix A,61 and § 148-51 of the part.
B. Standards for managing runoff.
(1) Standards for managing runoff for new development from each
subarea in the Chester Creek Watershed for the two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year design storms are shown
in Table 403-1. Development sites located in each of the districts
must control postdevelopment peak runoff rates to the specified
percentage of predevelopment peak runoff rates for the design
storms as shown in the table.

Districts
District Control Criteria
100% Postdevelopment peak discharge for all design storms
must be no greater than predevelopment peak
discharges.
75% Postdevelopment peak discharge for all design storms
must be no greater than 75% of the predevlopment
peak discharges.
50% Postdevelopment peak discharge for all design storms
must be no greater than 50% of the predevelopment
peak discharge.
SOURCE: Gannett Fleming, 2001
(2) All other areas shall utilize a 100% release rate for purposes of
implementation of this part.
C. Redevelopment projects shall meet peak discharge requirements based
on the adjusted runoff control number (RCN) or C value illustrated by
Figure B-3 in Appendix B.62
D. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
located within two or more release category subareas, the peak
discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak
discharge for each subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate.
The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the
grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea.

development activity differs significantly from the total site area, as
determined by the Township Engineer, only the proposed development
area and areas contributory to the proposed stormwater management
facilities shall be subject to the release rate criteria.
G. Regional detention alternatives (optional). For certain areas within the
study area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility
for more than one development site than to provide an individual
control facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for
any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of
prospective applicants. The design of any regional control basins must
incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed.
The peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-bycase
basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with
protection of the downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic model"
refers to the calibrated model as developed for the stormwater
management plan.
A. In addition to the performance standards and design criteria
requirements of §§ 148-51 and 148-52 and § 148-54 through § 148-56 of
this part, the applicant shall comply with the following water quality
requirements unless otherwise exempted by provisions of this part.
(1) The applicant shall first provide infiltration facilities in areas where
soils are suitable for infiltration and shall direct the runoff from
impervious surfaces into those infiltration facilities. The volume of
storage to be provided shall be no less than the total in runoff from
the two-year storm event, or one inch of runoff from the total area
draining to the infiltration facility, whichever is greater.
(2) If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the site, the
applicant shall create a riparian buffer extending a minimum of 30
feet to either side of the top of the bank of the channel. This
distance may be increased to 75 feet at the discretion of the
Township if the stream is the west branch of Chester Creek. The
buffer area shall be maintained with appropriate native vegetation
(see list of technical references in Appendix C of this part63). If the
applicable rear or side yard setback is less than 30 feet, the buffer
width may be reduced to 25% of the setback to a minimum of 10
feet. If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (e.g., deed covenant,
63.Editor's Note: Said appendix is located at the end of this chapter.
§ 148-52 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-53
144:253
easement, etc.) and it exceeds the requirement of this part, the
existing buffer shall be maintained.
(3) Detain the two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm runoff based on
using the SCS Type II distribution. Provisions shall be made so that
the detained runoff takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the
facility from a point where the maximum volume of water is
captured (i.e., the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in
the facility). Release of water can begin at the start of the storm
(i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the
facility). The design of the facility shall consider and minimize the
chances of clogging and sedimentation potential. The applicant
may also utilize infiltration facilities in lieu of extended detention.
The volume of infiltration provided for the contributing area may be
deducted from the volume requirement for extended detention.
B. The applicant shall submit designs for water quality facilities to the
Township Engineer for review and approval. Such designs may achieve
the water quality objectives through a combination of BMPs.
C. In selecting the appropriate BMPs or combinations thereof, the
applicant shall consider the following:
(1) Total contributing area.
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(3) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(4) Seasonal high-water table.
(5) Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
(6) Erodibility of soils.
(7) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
(8) Consistency with approved watershed and stormwater
management plans or regulations.
D. The following additional factors should be considered when evaluating
the suitability of BMPs used to control water quality at a given
development site:
(1) Peak discharge and required volume control.
(2) Streambank erosion.
(3) Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality
problems.
(4) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
(5) The nature of the pollutant being removed.

A. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater
than 200 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use a generally
accepted calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil-cover
complex method. Table 405-1 summarizes acceptable computation
methods. It is assumed that all methods will be selected by the design
professional based on the individual limitations and suitability of each

B. All calculations consistent with this part using the soil-cover complex
method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various
§ 148-53 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-54
144:255
return period storms presented in Table B-1 in Appendix B of this part.64
If a hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1 is used for
stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24
hours. The NRCS S curve shown in Figure B-1, Appendix B, of this part
shall be used for the rainfall distribution.
C. For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination in the
Chester Creek Watershed, undeveloped land shall be considered as
"meadow" good condition, type B soils, (RCN = 58, Rational C = 0.12)
unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve number or
Rational C value (i.e., forest). If a proposed development meets the
definition of "redevelopment" as defined in Article XII of this part, the
applicant may adjust the predevelopment RCN or C value based on the
curves presented in Figure B-3.65
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland flow
and return periods from the design storm curves from PA Department of
Transportation Design Rainfall Curves (1986) (Figure B-2).66 Times of
concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the
methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time
by NRCS). Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be
computed using Manning's Equation.
E. RCNs for both existing and proposed conditions to be used in the soilcover
complex method shall be obtained from Table B-2 in Appendix B
of this part.67
F. Runoff coefficients (C) for both existing and proposed conditions for use
in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table B-3 in Appendix B
of this part.68
G. Runoff characteristics of off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development shall be based on actual existing conditions, not RCN=58
or C=0.12, and shall be assumed to not have any controls implemented
on future development (i.e., no release rate restrictions).
H. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table B-4 in Appendix B of the
Ordinance.69

§ 148-55. Design criteria for stormwater management facilities.
I. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this part using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method. Acceptable
methods are presented in Handbook of Hydraulics, by King and Brater
(McGraw Hill). In addition, application of computer programs such as
HY-8 (Federal Highway Administration) or FlowMaster (Haestad
Methods) will also be accepted.
J. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this part shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the storageindication
method. For drainage areas greater than 20 acres in size, the
design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method
that produces a full hydrograph. The Township may approve the use of
any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation technique that
uses a total runoff volume that is consistent with the volume from a
method that produces a full hydrograph.
K. The Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations and conditions. If the
designer can substantiate through actual physical calibration that more
appropriate runoff and time-of-concentration values should be utilized
at a particular site, then appropriate variations may be made upon
review and recommendation of the Township Engineer. Calibration
shall require detailed gauge and rainfall data for the particular site in
question.
A. Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin) designed to
store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or
regulated by this part shall be designed to provide an emergency
spillway to handle flow up to and including the one-hundred-year
postdevelopment conditions. The height of the embankment must be set
so as to provide a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard above the maximum
pool elevation computed when the facility functions for the onehundred-
year postdevelopment inflow. Should any stormwater
management facility require a dam safety permit under DEP Chapter
105, the facility shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 105 and
meet the regulations of Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may
be required to pass storms larger than the one-hundred-year event.
B. Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges,
outfalls, or stream enclosures) and any work involving wetlands as
directed in DEP Chapter 105 regulations (as amended or replaced from
time to time by DEP) shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 105
and will require a permit from DEP. Any other drainage conveyance
facility that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations shall be
designed to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway, runoff from a minimum twenty-five-year design storm.
Municipalities may require design based on a larger storm event. Open
§ 148-54 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-55
144:257
channels shall be designed with a minimum of 1.0 foot of freeboard.
Any facility that constitutes a dam as defined in DEP Chapter 105
regulations may require a permit under dam safety regulations. Any
facility located within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT
minimum design standards and permit submission requirements. If the
primary drainage facilities do not have capacity for future flows, then a
safe drainage path must be provided to convey up to the one-hundredyear
design storm (without impacting structures).
C. Storm sewers must be able to convey postdevelopment runoff from a
minimum twenty-five-year design storm without surcharging inlets.
D. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels
and at all points of discharge.
E. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
sound engineering principles and practices. The Township shall reserve
the right to disapprove any design that would result in the occurrence
or continuation of an adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within
the watershed.
F. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
part.
G. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without written permission of the
adjacent property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this part.
H. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this part. If
diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the applicant must document to the Township in
accordance with § 148-54 that adequate downstream conveyance exists
to safely transport the concentrated discharge, or the applicant must
obtain drainage easements from affected downstream property owners
and provide the facilities to safely convey the flow.
I. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this part shall use the
following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased
peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon
§ 148-55 CONCORD CODE § 148-55
144:258
criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers, or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP, Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at a minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
J. Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, riparian
buffers shall be provided conforming to the line of such watercourses.
The width of the buffers shall be determined as set forth in
§ 148-53A(2). Excavating, placing of fill, building structures, or making
any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within
any portion of the riparian buffer shall be prohibited unless the
proposed work is associated with a regulated wetlands mitigation
program. The buffers must be defined through a deed covenant.
K. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by DEP through the joint permit application
process, or, where deemed appropriate by DEP, through the general
permit process.
L. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this part that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth or
wetlands shall be subject to approval by DEP through the joint permit
application process, or, where deemed appropriate by DEP, the general
permit process. When there is a question as to whether wetlands may
be involved, it is the responsibility of the applicant or his agent to show
that the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands; otherwise,
approval to work in the area must be obtained from DEP.
M. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this part that
would be located on state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to
approval by PennDOT.
N. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are required, where soil
conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need for detention
facilities.
O. In order to promote overland flow and infiltration/percolation of
stormwater, roof drains must discharge into an accepted BMP providing
infiltration and filtering of the stormwater.
§ 148-55 SPECIAL EVENTS § 148-56
144:259
§ 148-56. Erosion and sedimentation requirements.
A. Whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such
activity must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title 25, Rules and
Regulations, Part I, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, DEP, Subpart C,
protection of Natural Resources, Article II, Water Resources, Chapter
102, Erosion Control, and in accordance with the Delaware County or
Chester County Conservation Districts, as appropriate, and the
standards and specifications of the appropriate Township.
B. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed
include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase to
maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) In order to ensure compliance with Chapter 102, the timing of the
installation and operation of the infiltration BMP shall be at the
discretion of the Township Engineer.

principles and criteria:
(1) Proposed streets shall conform to such county and state street and
highway plans as have been prepared, adopted and/or filed as
prescribed by law.
(2) Residential streets shall be so laid out as to discourage through
traffic. However, the arrangement of streets shall provide for
continuation of existing or platted streets and for proper access to
adjoining undeveloped tracts suitable for future subdivision.
Further, provisions for emergency access and provisions for
accessibility by emergency vehicles shall be made.
(3) The proposed street pattern and layout shall be properly and
logically related to existing streets and their functional
characteristics (refer to Appendix G for the functional classification
of streets).
§ 160-38 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-39
155:357
(4) The proposed street pattern and layout shall be properly and
logically related to the topography of the land with regard to
grades and conditions of drainage. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the existing grade so as to produce usable
lots and minimize cuts and fills.
(5) The ultimate right-of-way of a street shall be shown in any
subdivision and/or land development plans. Further, the Board of
Supervisors may prescribe additional right-of-way requirements in
accordance with § 160-39C.

from the road and to create a greater variety of lot appearance
through a curvilinear alignment.
(7) The proposed street pattern and layout shall provide suitable
access to each lot and permit safe and convenient circulation of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
(8) Every lot shall have access to a public street, unless the Board of
Supervisors approves otherwise pursuant to and in accordance
with the requirements of § 160-81, Modification of site and plan
requirements, of this chapter. [Amended 5-3-1994 by Ord. No.
191]

collector streets and local primary streets into and from adjoining
areas, except when topographical or hydrological conditions shall
make the same impractical.
(10) All streets shall be platted to the boundary lines of the subdivision
or land development if the subdivision or land development adjoins
lands which may be developed in the future, and the same shall be
provided with easements and/or rights-of-way for turnarounds and,
if required by the Board of Supervisors, improved to the property
boundary, including improved turnaround areas.
(11) If lots resulting from subdivision are large enough to permit
resubdivision or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, a
notification requiring adequate street rights-of-way to permit
further subdivision and whether such is available shall be placed in
the plan.
(12) Streets that are extensions of or in alignment with existing named
streets shall bear the names of such existing streets, new street
names shall not duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing
street names in and adjacent to the Township and all street names
shall be approved by the Board of Supervisors and fire company
serving the Township.

employed to avoid abrupt changes in the cartway width or to other
improvements within the right-of-way.
(14) Any street not designed as a through street shall be designed to
Township cul-de-sac requirements found in Subsection B hereof.
[Amended 5-3-1994 by Ord. No. 191]
(15) Whenever a cul-de-sac or other street with a single point of ingress
and egress is proposed, the Board of Supervisors may require that
a right-of-way be shown on subdivision and/or land development
plans to allow for a future connection of such streets to streets on
an adjoining property.
(16) The Township may require the use of double frontage lots
whenever a subdivision and/or land development abuts an arterial
or collector street. Access to such double frontage lots shall be
from the local or interior subdivision street.
(17) Streets shall be designed so as to avoid edge deterioration through
the use of curbs as required in § 160-40.
(18) In the event that any part of a development abuts a Township or
state road that is not fully improved to the design standards which
correspond to the road classification enumerated in the
Comprehensive Plan108 and contained in the Appendixes, said
street shall be improved to meet the applicable design standard for
the street in question, especially in terms of cartway and right-ofway
widths and § 160-39C(21), unless approved otherwise by the
Board of Supervisors.
(19) Where a subdivision or land development abuts a railroad, streets
crossing the rail line shall be kept to a minimum and placed to
facilitate grade separation.
(20) Streets shall be designed for maximum safety for fire trucks and
other emergency vehicles and shall be approved by the Board of
Supervisors upon the recommendation of the Fire Marshal.
B. Cul-de-sac streets shall be designed as follows:
(1) Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 700 feet and shall be at least
250 feet in length. If the cul-de-sac street intersects another cul-desac
street, the maximum total length of the sum of the streets shall
not exceed 700 feet. [Amended 5-3-1994 by Ord. No. 191]
(2) Culs-de-sac shall have a closed-end turnaround with a right-of-way
having a minimum outside radius of 50 feet and shall be paved to a
radius of not less than 40 feet.
(3) When required for future extension, the turnaround right-of-way
shall be placed adjacent to the tract boundary with sufficient width
108. Editor's Note: The Comprehensive Plan is on file in the Township offices.
§ 160-39 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-39
155:359
along the boundary line to permit extension of the street at full
width.
(4) Drainage of culs-de-sac shall be directed to flow along the curbline.
Drainage shall be toward the open end of the cul-de-sac whenever
possible. Superelevated culs-de-sac shall be prohibited.
(5) No cul-de-sac turnaround shall have a grade which exceeds 4%.
(6) The minimum grade for a cul-de-sac shall be 1%.
(7) All design standards in § 160-39C which are pertinent to culs-desac
shall apply.
C. In addition to the aforementioned principles and criteria set forth in
§ 160-39A and B, the following shall apply to all streets:
(1) The determination of which proposed streets are to be considered
as collector roads and which proposed streets are to be considered
as local roads shall be made by the Township Engineer in
accordance with the definitions of Article II and the traffic
capacities for such streets.
(2) Streets shall be designed according to their function and laid out to
preserve the integrity of their design. Streets shall be classified by
functions, as follows: [Amended 5-3-1994 by Ord. No. 191]

the Board of Supervisors due to densities of dwelling units,
increased usage of existing roadways or topographical conditions.
Before during so, a special study shall be made by the Township
Engineer or other consultant to determine whether or not these
additional requirements are necessary, and the Board shall, upon
conclusion of said study, have the discretion to change these

development, and the laterals shall be capped at the street right-ofway.
When capped sewers are so provided, on-site sewage disposal
facilities shall also be installed, provided that they are so located as
to permit the easiest and least expensive connection to use the
public sanitary sewer system when such connection becomes
available. [Amended 5-3-1994 by Ord. No. 191]
(2) Prior to the approval of any subdivision and/or land development
involving a public sanitary sewer (either live or capped), sewage
pumping stations, sewage treatment plants and community sewage
disposal systems, a properly detailed construction plan shall be
submitted to the Township and Township Sewer Authority for
review and approval. The detail of the plan shall be determined by
the Township Engineer.
§ 160-44 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-45
155:373
(3) A sewer shall be considered to be planned for extension to a given
area any time after preliminary engineering and related studies
have been initiated preparatory to the construction of facilities
adequate to serve the area containing a subdivision or land
development or when the area is shown to be in a proposed sewer
service area in the Official Sewage Facilities Plan.
(4) All sanitary sewer lines, lateral connections and manholes and
other facilities shall be constructed and installed and shall provide
service to each lot in conformity with standards of the Township
Sewer Authority at the cost and expense of the landowner or
developer.
(5) When such sanitary sewer facilities are installed in accordance
with this section, the same shall be inspected by the Township
Engineer during such construction at the cost and expense of the
landowner or developer, in accordance with the standards and
procedures established for inspection in Article XII.
(6) When such sanitary sewer facilities are not to be constructed or
otherwise installed, on-lot, community on-lot and on-site sewage
disposal systems shall be constructed in accordance with statutes
and regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection and the Township and as approved by the Sewage
Enforcement Officer. The ownership and maintenance of such
system shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Supervisors.
When on-lot sewage disposal systems are to be utilized, the
landowner or developer shall furnish evidence of the feasibility and
satisfactory operation of the system to be utilized in the subdivision
or land development as required in Articles V and VI.
(7) Where community on-lot sewage disposal systems are proposed,
such a system shall be no closer than 200 feet to any adjacent
property lines. Where such a system requires a building or
structure to be located above ground, the building or structure
shall be completely screened from the view of any adjacent
properties according to the screening provisions of Article XXI of
Chapter 210, Zoning.
(8) Any community on-lot sewage disposal system shall: [Amended
5-3-1994 by Ord. No. 191]
(a) Be located on the same property being subdivided or
developed.
(b) Be on a lot, the area for which meets the minimum size
requirements of the district in which it is located.
(9) Where on-site sanitary sewage facilities are to be utilized, each lot
so served shall be of a size and shape to accommodate the
necessary length of tile fields at a safe distance from and at a lower
elevation than the proposed well and building(s) to facilitate
§ 160-45 CONCORD CODE § 160-45
155:374
gravity flow in accordance with Township and state regulations and
shall be so plotted.
(10) If on-site sanitary sewage disposal facilities are to be utilized, the
Township Planning Commission may require that the developer
submit a feasibility report. Such report shall compare the cost of
providing on-site facilities with a sewage treatment plant. Based on
the analysis of this report, the Township may require the
installation of a public sanitary sewer system or capped sewer.
(11) Whenever a developer proposes that individual on-site sanitary
sewage disposal systems shall be utilized within the subdivision,
the developer shall either install such a facility approved by the
Sewage Enforcement Officer or shall guarantee (by deed
restriction or otherwise), as a condition of the sale of each lot or
parcel within the subdivision, that such facilities can be installed by
the purchaser of such lot or parcel. The on-site system shall be
located on the lot it is intended to serve.
(12) Soil percolation test requirement.
(a) Soil percolation tests shall be performed for all lots within
subdivisions and/or land developments of fewer than 10 lots,
prior to final plan approval, wherein buildings, at the time of
construction, will not be connected to a public or community
sanitary sewage disposal system in operation. In lieu of soil
percolation tests for individual lots in subdivisions and/or land
developments greater than 10 lots, soil percolation tests shall
be performed on a cross section of soil types to determine their
suitability for on-site sewage disposal. Deep-hole test pits are
recommended as a further means of guaranteeing suitability of
a site.
(b) Soil percolation tests shall be made in accordance with the
procedure required by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, by either a registered professional
engineer or registered sanitarian and/or the Pennsylvania
Sewage Facilities Act Sewage Enforcement Officer.111
(c) Soil percolation tests shall be performed on each lot within the
site of the proposed on-site sanitary sewage disposal facilities.
[Amended 5-3-1994 by Ord. No. 191]
(d) The results of the soil percolation tests shall be analyzed in
relation to the physical characteristics of of the tract being
subdivided and of the general area surrounding the tract being
subdivided. The final plan lot layout shall be based on this
analysis.

§ 160-46. Water supply.
(e) Where applicable, the plan should note that "lot ______ has
failed to obtain acceptable percolation." The lot shall not be
developed without a sewage disposal system approved by the
Township and its Sewage Enforcement Officer and a sewage
disposal permit issued. A building permit shall not be applied
for or acted upon until proof of the sewage disposal permit is
provided to the Building Inspector.
A. Adequate and potable water supply system(s) shall be installed
consistent with design principles and requirements contained in this
chapter and Township standards, which are the United Sates public
health criteria for drinking water as administered by the existing
Environmental Protection Agency Safe Drinking Water Act.112
B. All subdivisions which create 10 or more lots shall be provided with a
complete public or community water distribution system. Land
developments shall be subject to the same standard unless a water
distribution system is not readily available. The design and installation
of such public system shall be subject to the approval of the Township,
and the design and installation of such community distribution system
shall be subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, and such system shall be further subject to
satisfactory provision for the maintenance thereof. Where a permit is
required by said Department, it shall be presented as evidence of such
review and approval in the case of private or public systems before
construction commences.
C. Wherever a public or community water system is provided, fire
hydrants or acceptable alternatives shall be installed for fire protection,
as approved by the local fire company and Township Engineer. Where
fire hydrants are installed, they shall meet the specifications of the
Insurance Services Office of Pennsylvania. Location of hydrants shall be
approved by the Township.
(1) Generally, all fire hydrants will be located on a minimum looped sixinch
line. Where a dead-end line is required to contain a fire
hydrant, the portion of the line between the main loop and the
hydrant shall be an eight-inch minimum diameter.
(2) Fire hydrants shall be spaced in a development so that all proposed
buildings will be no more than 600 feet from the hydrant measured
along traveled ways.
(3) All community water systems must provide a minimum of 500
gallons per minute at a residual pressure of 20 pounds per square
inch for a two-hour period.
112. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 721.1 et seq.
§ 160-45 CONCORD CODE § 160-46
155:376
(4) For additional fire protection, a dry hydrant may be required and
incorporated into existing or proposed ponds or reservoirs and an
access easement provided for emergency use.
D. Wherever a public or community water system is provided, applicants
shall present evidence to the Board of Supervisors that the subdivision
or land development is to be supplied by a certificated public utility, a
bona fide cooperative association of lot owners or a municipal authority
or utility. A copy of a certificate of public convenience from the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or an application for such
certificate, a cooperative agreement or a commitment or agreement to
serve the area in question, whichever is appropriate, shall be
acceptable evidence.
E. Where the developer proposes that individual on-site water supply
systems shall be utilized within the subdivision, the developer shall
either install such facilities or shall guarantee (by deed restriction or
otherwise), as a condition of the sale of each lot or parcel within the
subdivision, that the facilities can be installed by the purchaser of such
lot or parcel. Individual on-site wells shall be subject to the standards
provided for within.
F. Minimum water supply requirements. In all subdivisions and land
developments served by public water, the following water pressure and
gallonage requirements shall apply:
(1) Residential use.
(a) A minimum domestic pressure of 30 pounds per square inch
shall be provided at each house to be connected to the water
main. The system to which the residential unit is connected
shall have sufficient capacity to supply a minimum of 300
gallons of water per residential unit per day within the
subdivision or land development.
(b) For purposes of fire protection in residential districts, the
system shall be demonstrably capable of providing fire flowwater
requirements, for a minimum duration of two hours, of
not less than 500 gallons per minute at a residual pressure of
20 pounds per square inch or more as required for
International Standards Organization (ISO) certification.
(2) Commercial or industrial use.
(a) A minimum pressure of 30 pounds per square inch shall be
provided at each commercial or industrial building connected
to the water supply main. When a builder wishes to connect to
a public water system, a study will be made to determine if
there is adequate water to supply the building and use.
(b) For purposes of fire protection in commercial and industrial
districts, 1,000 gallons per minute at 20 pounds per square
§ 160-46 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-46
155:377
inch residual pressure is required or the requirements for ISO
certification shall be met.
G. Approvals conditioned upon adequacy of public water supply. No
subdivision or land development application proposing a public water
supply system shall be granted preliminary or final plan approval unless
the applicant demonstrates, by a fair preponderance of the credible
evidence, full compliance with the provisions of this section.
H. Construction standards.
(1) Water mains shall be constructed of the cement-lined, ductile iron,
minimum Class 52 pipe, or as approved by the Township Engineer.
No extension of water mains shall be permitted for a pipe having a
diameter of less than six inches.
(2) All pipe shall have a minimum cover of three feet six inches from
grade to the crown of pipe.
(3) Generally, water mains shall be so designed as to form a loop
system to enhance the continual supply of fresh water. When dead
ends occur on new mains, they shall all be closed with cast iron
plugs and caps, a blowoff valve, a concrete anchor or a fire hydrant.
(4) Mains shall be drained through drainage branches or blowoffs to
dry wells from which the water can be pumped. Drainage branches,
blowoffs, air vents and appurtenances shall be provided with
valves.
(5) Blowoffs shall not be connected to any sewer or submerged in any
manner that will permit back siphonage in the distribution system.
All blowoffs should be located out of paving.
(6) Valves in water mains shall, where possible, be located on the
street property lines extended. A cast iron valve box or a masonry
pit shall be provided for every valve which has no gearing or
mechanism or for which the gearing or operating mechanism is
fully protected with a cast iron grease case. A masonry valve pit
shall be provided for every valve which has exposed gearing or
operating mechanisms.
(7) Manholes shall be constructed of brick or concrete, with cast iron
frames and covers, or as approved by the Township Engineer.
(8) Fire hydrants shall be provided as an integral part of any public
water system. They shall be located no farther than 600 feet apart,
as measured along traveled ways. Each hydrant shall be connected
to the main with a minimum of six-inch ductile iron branch
controlled by a minimum of an independent six-inch gate valve.
(9) Hydrants shall be located in a manner to provide complete
accessibility and so that the possibility of damage from vehicles or
injury to pedestrians will be minimized. When placed behind the
§ 160-46 CONCORD CODE § 160-46
155:378
§ 160-47. Stormwater management.
All stormwater management practices shall be in accordance with the
applicable sections of Chapter 148, Stormwater Management (refer to the
Appendixes).
§ 160-48. Soil erosion and sedimentation control.
All soil erosion and sedimentation control practices shall be in accordance
with the applicable sections of Chapter 148, Stormwater Management
(refer to the Appendixes).
§ 160-49. Natural features protection standards. [Amended
12-22-2015 by Ord. No. 371]
All uses and activities established after the effective date of this chapter
shall comply with these standards, except for a minor subdivision involving
three or fewer residential dwelling units. Site alterations, regrading, filling
or clearing of vegetation prior to the approval of plans for subdivision or
curb, the hydrant barrel shall be set so that no portion of the
pumper or nozzle cap will be less than 24 inches from the gutter
face of the curb. When set in the lawn space between the curb and
the property line, no portion of the hydrant or nozzle cap shall be
within six inches of the sidewalk.
(10) All hydrant connections shall be reviewed by the fire company
having jurisdiction with a favorable recommendation by the Chief
of said fire company being required.
I. It is recommended that two sources of groundwater be provided for
each community water system due to the usual density and demand
served by such systems. Each should be capable of supplying the
average daily demand of the proposed dwelling units. Although a twowell
system is ideal, there are alternatives, as follow, which would
ensure an adequate water supply:
(1) A single well capable of providing twice the daily average demand,
as demonstrated by a pumping test of at least 48 hours duration,
producing a stabilized drawdown of unchanging water level for at
least five hours' duration.
(2) A single well capable of supplying the average daily demand with
an additional reliable surface water source.
(3) A single well capable of supplying the average daily demand, plus a
dependable connection to another satisfactory public water supply
system.
(4) A second well is recommended for use as a monitor of the aquifer
and as a standby in the event of an emergency.
§ 160-46 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-49
155:379
land development shall be a violation of this chapter. In addition to the
standards set forth in § 160-50 and § 160-81B, the following shall apply:
A. Consideration shall be shown for all natural features, such as notable
trees, heritage trees, watercourses, wetlands, rock outcroppings and
similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness
and value to the remainder of the subdivision or land development. No
property may be altered in a way that will reduce the aggregate
acreage required to be protected under this section. If any area is
subject to restriction with respect to two or more resources under this
section, the more restrictive regulation shall control.
B. Tree masses, notable trees, and heritage trees shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible, and in no event shall more than 20% of a tree
mass be graded, cleared or built upon, except for approved agricultural,
historical, and/or recreational uses. All structures should be located in
such a manner as to minimize damage to vegetation. Existing open
areas should be developed instead of wooded areas. Areas in which
trees are retained should remain undisturbed out to the canopy drip
line and at the original grade level to the maximum extent possible.
"Notable trees" are trees located outside of a tree mass having a
twenty-four-inch DBH or greater.
C. No more than 20% of the notable trees and heritage trees on any
property shall be removed, and notable trees and heritage trees shall
not be removed unless they are located within the proposed cartway or
sidewalk portion of a street right-of-way, within 15 feet of the
foundation area of a new building, within a utility easement, within a
proposed parking area or within an area where regrading necessary to
achieve land development may endanger the trees. The Board of
Supervisors may require the landowner or developer to plant one tree
of not less than three inches in caliper for each tree of 12 inches DBH or
more to be removed, and two trees of not less than three inches in
caliper for each tree of 24 inches DBH or more to be removed.
D. Where a proposed subdivision or land development necessitates the
clearing of notable trees, heritage trees, or portions of tree masses
within the limits permitted by § 160-49B and C, landowners or
developers shall be guided by the following criteria in selecting trees
for clearing:
(1) The existence of disease, rot, dieback or other damage to the tree;
(2) Susceptibility of the tree to insect and disease attack;
(3) Species longevity;
(4) Wind-throw potential and characteristic of the soil to hold trees;
and
(5) Protection of buildings (e.g., dead and large limbs hanging over a
building should be removed).
§ 160-49 CONCORD CODE § 160-49
155:380
E. Landowners or developers shall exercise care to protect trees from
damage during construction in accordance with § 160-50B(2). Tree
removal shall be limited to the actual construction site necessary to
build and move construction equipment.
F. Streams, watercourses, wetlands, wetland margins and ponds.
(1) Such areas shall not be altered, regraded, developed, filled, piped,
diverted or built upon except:
(a) Roads may cross streams, watercourses, and wetlands or
wetland margins where design approval is obtained from the
Township, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection and/or other applicable agency and where no other
reasonable access is available.
(b) Stormwater management facilities and fire ponds may be
placed in conjunction with a pond in accordance with this
chapter and Chapter 210, Zoning, when approved by the
Township.
(c) "Wetland margins." For wetlands of 5,000 square feet or larger
located upon a site, a wetland margin shall be provided. The
wetlands margin shall extend from the wetlands to the limit of
hydric soils or 75 feet, whichever is greater.
(2) In the event that a wetlands delineation, validated by the United
States Army Corps of Engineers, is shown to vary from the
wetlands boundary derived from the definition in Article II of this
chapter, the Corps' delineation will govern. The wetlands margin
will then be measured from the Corps' delineated boundary.
(3) Wetlands margins shall not be altered, regraded, filled or built
upon.
(4) Federal and state wetlands regulations. Whenever activities or
improvements would entail the regrading or placement of fill in
wetlands, the applicant shall provide the Township with proof that
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (Bureau
of Dams and Waterway Management) and the United States Army
Corps of Engineers have been contacted to determine the
applicability of state and federal wetland regulations for areas
identified as wetlands on the National Wetland Inventory (NWI)
Maps, United States Fish and Wildlife Service; which meet the
agencies' definitions of wetlands; or which are in accordance with
the Unified Federal Method.
(5) Land subject to flooding.
(a) Land subject to flooding or other hazards to life, health or
property and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable
shall not be platted for residential occupancy or for such other
§ 160-49 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-49
155:381
uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or
aggravate soil erosion or flood hazard until all such hazards
have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards against
such hazards are provided by the subdivision or land
development plans.
(b) Such land within the subdivision or land development shall be
set aside on the plat for uses as shall not be endangered by
periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce
unsatisfactory living conditions.
(c) Where flooding is known to have occurred within an area
shown on the plat, such area shall be clearly marked "subject
to periodic flooding" and shall not be platted in streets and lots
unless approved otherwise in accordance with Chapter 210,
Zoning.
(d) Floodplain elevations shall be as established in Chapter 210,
Zoning, Article XX, entitled "Floodplain Conservation District."
(6) Streams. Riparian buffers, extending at least 35 feet outward from
the top-of-bank of a watercourse, shall be established on each side
of each stream. These buffers shall not be altered, removed,
regraded, filled, piped, or built upon, except that roads may cross a
riparian buffer where design approval is obtained from the
Township and any other applicable governmental agency and
where no other reasonable access is available.
G. Steep and very steep slopes.
(1) The intent of these regulations is as follows:
(a) To conserve and protect steep and very steep slopes from
inappropriate development, such as excessive grading,
landform alteration and extensive vegetation removal.
(b) To avoid potential hazards to property and the disruption of
ecological balance which may be caused by increased runoff,
flooding, soil erosion and sedimentation, blasting and ripping
of rock and landslide and soil failure.
(c) To encourage the use of steep and very steep slopes for
conservation and other uses which are compatible with the
preservation of natural resources and protection of areas of
environmental concern.
(2) The following uses are permitted in a Natural Features Protection
Area within areas of very steep slope and steep slope:
(a) In areas of very steep slope, provided that they are also in
compliance with all other provisions of this Code:
[1] Parks and outdoor recreational uses.
§ 160-49 CONCORD CODE § 160-49
155:382
[2] Logging and woodcutting approved by the Board of
Supervisors.
[3] Grading for the minimum portion of a driveway necessary
to access a single-family dwelling when it can be
demonstrated that no other alignment which avoids very
steep slopes is feasible.
[4] Yard areas of any permitted building so long as such
building is itself not within the very steep slope area,
unless permitted as a conditional use.
[5] Public sewer and public water lines.
(b) In areas of steep slope, provided that they are also in
compliance with all other provisions of this Code:
[1] Parks and other outdoor recreational uses.
[2] Tree farming, forestry and other agricultural uses
conducted in conformity with good conservation practices
as approved by the Board of Supervisors.
[3] Any road necessary to provide primary access to a use
listed in § 160-49G(2) when no practical alternative exists
in an area of lesser slope.
[4] Accessory uses (other than swimming pools) necessary for
the operation and maintenance of the above uses.
[5] Yard area of any permitted building or use.
[6] Public sewer and public water lines.
(3) It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate or impair any
regulations set forth in any other articles herein, any regulations of
Chapter 210, Zoning, or any easements, covenants or deed
restrictions, except that where this section imposes greater
restrictions, its provisions shall prevail. Further, nothing contained
in this section shall diminish in any way the provisions of the Clean
Streams Law113 and/or Chapter 102 of the Department of
Environmental Protection's rules and regulations or any other
applicable state, federal, county or Township regulations, codes,
ordinances and the like.
(4) Areas of steep and very steep slopes are depicted on Figure A-3 of
the Comprehensive Plan114 (refer to the Topography: Slope map in
the Appendixes) and constitute only a general representation,
based on the analysis of the contours displayed on the United
States Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangles. As such, refined

§ 160-49 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-49
155:383
mapping will be required to more accurately define the district, as
specified in Subsection G(5) below.
(5) Interpretation of steep and very steep slope areas.
(a) In any application for subdivision and/or land development
where the lot includes areas of steep and very steep slopes, the
applicant shall, using two-foot contours, delineate slopes from
15% to 25% (steep slopes) and greater than or equal to 25%
(very steep slopes). Further, the applicant shall use an actual
field topographic survey or aerial survey as the source of
contour information and the basis for depicting such slope
categories.
(b) This section shall apply only to those steep or very steep slopes
which exist for three consecutive two-foot contour intervals
(six cumulative vertical feet of slope). All steep and very steep
slope areas shall be shown for the purpose of Township review
and verification, but only those occurring over three
consecutive two-foot contour intervals will invoke the
standards of Subsection G(7).
(c) Once delineated, the mapping provided by the applicant will be
reviewed by the Planning Commission and the Township
Engineer. The applicant will be required to follow all
regulations of this section for those areas which reflect steep
slope and very steep slope conditions as determined in
accordance with this section through the Planning
Commission's and Township Engineer's review.
(6) Application procedures. Before a permit is issued for any
construction or land disturbance activity on land within or affecting
steep and very steep slope areas, the following material shall be
submitted for review by the Township Engineer:
(a) Plans drawn to a scale of at least one inch equals 50 feet,
sealed by a registered professional engineer, depicting the
following:
[1] The location, dimensions and elevation of the property.
[2] Existing and proposed uses and development.
[3] An earth-moving plan of the property which indicates
existing grades with contour lines at two-foot intervals and
proposed grades within the area of any proposed activity,
disturbance or construction. All areas of steep and/or very
steep slope shall be graphically distinguished.
[4] A site plan indicating existing and proposed structures,
other impervious surfaces, storm drainage facilities and
retaining walls. The site plan also shall locate and identify
§ 160-49 CONCORD CODE § 160-49
155:384
existing vegetation, including woodlands, open areas and
their ground-cover type within areas of steep and very
steep slopes, as well as proposed landscaping material to
be installed.
[5] Typical cross sections and elevations of the property and
proposed structures at intervals prescribed by the
Township Engineer, as well as architectural plans,
elevations and sections.
[6] Photographs showing existing uses, vegetation and
topography within the steep and very steep slope areas.
[7] A statement, signed and sealed by a registered architect or
professional engineer, explaining the building methods to
be used in overcoming foundation and other structural
problems created by slope conditions, preserving the
natural drainage, preventing soil erosion and excessive
surface-water runoff to neighboring properties and/or
streets and the type of sewage disposal and water supply.
[8] Plan, profile and typical cross sections of any proposed
street, emergency access or driveway within areas of steep
and very steep slopes, with the seal of a registered
professional engineer thereon.
[9] A statement, signed by the owner or future occupant at the
time of subdivision, land development or building permit
application, that there is a full understanding of any
difficulties associated with access stemming from such
slopes. No plan shall be approved and no conditional use
shall be granted by the Board of Supervisors without the
Township Engineer's review of this material and his
recommendation thereon.
(7) Standards and criteria for applications. In evaluating any
application for subdivision, land development, building permit or
conditional use permit approval within steep slope areas and very
steep slope areas, the Board of Supervisors shall determine
consistency of the proposal with the following:
(a) Disturbance to particularly sensitive features of the site shall
be minimized; special emphasis in planning for the site shall be
given to the protection of:
[1] The steepest areas of steep slopes, i.e., those in the 20% to
25% range.
[2] Soils on the edge of steep and very steep slopes with
seasonal high-water table.

230; 2-6-2001 by Ord. No. 256]
[3] Underlying geology which comprises or contributes to a
major groundwater resource, including the flow of existing
springs.
(b) Disturbances shall be minimized where the length or area of
steep and very steep slope is extensive both on the site and on
adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site. The area which is
regraded and/or stripped of vegetation shall not exceed 30% of
each steep and very steep slope area.
(c) The proposed development, any impervious ground cover and
their resultant disturbance to the land and existing vegetative
cover will not cause surface water runoff and/or related
environmental problems off the site.
(d) Removal of or disturbance to existing vegetation in steep and
very steep slope areas shall be minimized. The proposed
impacts on existing vegetation shall be evaluated in terms of
the potentially detrimental effects on slope stability,
conveyance and recharge of stormwater, aesthetic
characteristics of the landscape and existing drainage
patterns. Further, it shall be demonstrated that any and all
reasonable mitigation techniques and procedures will be
utilized or have been considered in the preparation of the
subdivision and/or land development plan, such as
revegetation measures, control of soil erosion and
sedimentation, stormwater management and the like.

provide shade; to ameliorate stormwater drainage problems;
to replenish the groundwater table; and to provide for a more
attractive setting.
(b) Perimeter buffering. The outer perimeter of all parking areas
shall be screened. Effective screens shall be accomplished
through the use of plant materials, fencing or walls and/or
mounding through the use of earthen berms.
[1] Buffering along public road frontage. See Appendix D-5.117
[2] Buffering from residential uses. A screen five feet wide
(minimum), six feet high (minimum) must be planted to
buffer all residential uses from parking areas for over five
vehicles and from all service areas, and must be protected
by a two-and-one-half-foot space between the edge of the
planting and curbing or wheelstops. The screen should
consist of evergreen shrubs, planted on four-foot centers,
or evergreen trees planted on ten-foot centers. Where
proposed plantings are less than six feet in height, berms,
walls, or fencing may be used to provide the required
height.
[3] Buffering between zoning districts. A screen of at least five
feet wide and 4 1/2 feet high shall separate parking lots
from any property which is in a different zoning district.
Passageways for vehicles from one lot to the other may be
kept free from planting. The screen should consist of
evergreen trees or shrubs planted on eight-foot centers, or
deciduous shrubs placed on five-foot centers.
(c) All parking areas shall be landscaped. Each parking lot shall
have one three-inch-minimum-caliper shade tree for every five

buffers loading areas, the Board of Supervisors may waive the
requirement for additional screening.
D. All buildings for which landscaping is required shall be landscaped in
accordance with the following criteria:
(1) A combination of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs shall
be used as foundation plantings, i.e., plantings to be installed in
reasonably close proximity to the facades.
(2) One three-inch to three-and-one-half-inch caliper specimen
deciduous tree shall be planted for every one-hundred-foot length
of building perimeter, measured from end to end, of buildings,

streets in surrounding areas or conform to a plan for the
§ 160-60 CONCORD CODE § 160-60
155:404
neighborhood approved or adopted by the Board of
Supervisors to meet a particular situation where topographical
or other conditions make continuance or conformance to
existing streets impracticable.
(c) Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged.
(d) To facilitate snow removal and to permit easy access for firefighting
equipment and delivery trucks, dead-end streets (culsde-
sac), designed to be so permanently, shall be provided at the
closed end with a turnaround having an outside cartway radius
of at least 40 feet and a right-of-way line radius of at least 50
feet. Such streets shall be no longer than 700 feet, measured
from its intersecting center line to the center of the
turnaround, except where topographical or other conditions
make this limitation impracticable as determined by the Board
of Supervisors. [Amended 1-5-1998 by Ord. No. 221]
(3) Access to streets.

design and location of the green areas required by this section
shall be indicated on a development or subdivision or other
similar plan and be permanently maintained as such.
J. In addition to the requirements of Chapter 210, Zoning, the following
regulations shall also apply.
§ 160-60 CONCORD CODE § 160-60
155:410
(1) Arrangement. The common space shall be designed as a contiguous
area unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Board of Supervisors that two or more separate areas would be
preferable. The open space shall also have easily identifiable
pedestrian and visual accessibility to all residents of the mobile
home development, although all units do not have to abut the
common open space.
(2) Recreation. Recreation areas and facilities acceptable to the Board
of Supervisors shall be provided to meet the anticipated needs of
the residents of the development. Not less than 25% of the required
open space area, exclusive of lands within the required buffers,
shall be devoted to recreation. Recreation areas should be of a size,
shape and relief that is conducive to active and passive recreation.
K. Buffers.
(1) General requirements. Along all exterior property boundary lines
except those which abut another mobile home development, there
shall be a permanent buffer at least 15 feet in depth, unless this is
waived pursuant to Subsection K(4). A screen buffer (as defined
herein) shall be provided wherever the mobile home development
abuts existing residential zones and/or residential uses or any
existing street [as modified by Subsection K(3)], drive or parking
area and where abutting other types of uses when deemed
necessary by the Board of Supervisors to provide sufficient
buffering and transition. No less than a softening buffer (as defined
herein) shall be provided wherever the mobile home development
abuts existing commercial, office and industrial uses. No less than
an open buffer shall be provided where more extensive buffers are
deemed unnecessary by the Board of Supervisors.
(2) Components.
(a) Screen buffer. The primary component of a screen buffer shall
be a row of suitable evergreen trees at a height of not less than
six feet when planted and spaced not more than 10 feet apart
on center, and these trees shall be of such species to attain a
height at maturity of not less than 20 feet. Also required as a
secondary component of the buffer is one of the following:
mounding (the use of which is encouraged), provided that the
slopes shall be a maximum of 3 to 1; visually opaque fencing
not greater than six feet in height; and coniferous shrubbery.
Any combination of evergreen trees, coniferous shrubs,
mounding, fencing or other natural vegetation or man-made
material is allowable, provided that an effective visual screen
at least 15 feet in height above the adjacent ground elevation
in the mobile home development is achieved within a
reasonable time. But whenever only vegetation is used, there
shall be at least a double row of evergreen trees, with the trees
§ 160-60 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-60
155:411
in one row offset five feet from the trees in the other row and
the rows at least five feet apart.
(b) Softening buffer. The primary component of a softening buffer
shall be a row of trees spaced not more than 25 feet apart on
center, at least 25% of which shall be evergreens. The
evergreen trees shall be at least six feet in height when planted
and shall attain at least 20 feet in height maturity. Any
deciduous trees shall be at least 1 1/2 inches in caliper and
eight feet in height when planted and shall attain a height of
not less than 20 feet at maturity. These trees shall be
interspersed with other allowable components, including any
other type of trees, shrubs, mounding, fencing and/or similar
natural or man-made elements having a visible vertical
dimension or any combination thereof.
(c) Open buffer. The open buffer shall, as a minimum, consist of
grass, ground cover and/or similar vegetative material and
may include trees, shrubs or other natural or man-made
landscaping materials, but it shall be mostly vegetative rather
than paved.
(3) Street boundaries. Wherever necessary for adequate sight distance
or where the Board of Supervisors so determines that a sufficient
buffer exists to protect the welfare and safety of the community, a
single row of deciduous trees at least eight feet in height at
maturity and with a spacing of not more than 40 feet on center may
be provided along all property boundaries which abut a street.
(4) Existing buffers. In cases where an edge(s) of a mobile home
development occurs along natural features which function as
buffers, including but not limited to mature vegetation, significant
grade changes or stream valleys which are likely to be permanently
preserved, buffering may be waived along that edge(s) upon
approval of the Board of Supervisors.
(5) Maintenance. All vegetation shall be maintained permanently and,

ARTICLE X
Improvements
§ 160-70. Completion of improvements.
§ 160-71. Completion guaranty.
A. No subdivision and/or land development application shall be finally
approved unless the streets shown on such plan have been improved to
a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition or improved as
required by this chapter and any walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights,
fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers
and other improvements as required by this chapter have been installed
in accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for final plan approval, including
improvements or fees, the landowner or developer shall deposit
financial security with the Township in an amount sufficient to cover the
costs of such improvements or common amenities, including but not
limited to roads, stormwater detention and/or retention basins and
other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space
improvements or buffer or screen plantings which are or may be
required.
B. When requested by the landowner or developer, in order to facilitate
financing, the Board of Supervisors shall furnish the developer with a
signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plan
contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial
security. The final plan (record plan) shall not be signed nor recorded
until the financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution
or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be
revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within 90
days, unless a written extension is granted by the Board of Supervisors.
Such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed,
in writing, at the request of the landowner or developer.
A. In lieu of the completion of the streets and other improvements
required as a condition for the final approval of the subdivision and/or
land development plan, as set forth in § 160-13 and § 160-70, the
landowner or developer may deposit financial security acceptable to the
Board of Supervisors (except as set forth in this section) in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements, estimated,
calculated and determined as set forth below.
B. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security.
C. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution chosen by the
§ 160-70 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-71
155:427
party posting the financial security, provided that said bonding
company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such business
within the commonwealth.
D. Such bond or other security shall provide for and secure to the public
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
E. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the landowner or developer. The Township may adjust the amount of the
financial security annually by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for
the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of
the 90th day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a
rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the
Township may require the landowner or developer to post additional
security in order to assure that the financial security equals said 110%.
Any additional security shall be posted by the landowner or developer
in accordance with this subsection.
F. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by a landowner or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Township, upon the recommendation of the Township Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the landowner
or developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate,
then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Township and the landowner or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be
paid equally by the Township and the landowner or developer.
G. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
H. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plans by section
or stages of development, subject to such requirements or guaranties
§ 160-71 CONCORD CODE § 160-71
155:428
as to improvements in future sections or stages of development as it
finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
I. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the release, from time to time, of
such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall
be in writing, addressed to the Board of Supervisors, who shall have 45
days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Township
Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such
portion of the work upon the improvements has been completed in
accordance with the approved plan. Upon such certification, the Board
of Supervisors shall authorize release by the bonding company or
lending institution of an amount, as estimated by the Township
Engineer, fairly representing the value of the improvements completed,
or if the Board of Supervisors fails to act within said 45 day period, the
Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to have approved the release of
funds as requested. The Board of Supervisors may, prior to final release
at the time of completion and certification by its Engineer, require
retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
J. Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Board may require
the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of said
improvements, as well as the functioning of said improvements, in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plan for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as
otherwise required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed
15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
K. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Township, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this section.
L. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final plan approval, the
Township shall not condition the issuance of building, grading or other
permits relating to the erection or placement of improvements,
including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the final
plan upon actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the
approved final plan. Moreover, if said financial security has been
provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected
§ 160-71 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-71
155:429
§ 160-72. Release from improvement bond.
§ 160-73. As-built plan.
shall not be withheld following the improvement of the streets
providing access to and from existing public roads to such building or
buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition,
as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon
the approved final plan, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or
lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable
use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
A. When the landowner or developer has completed all of the necessary
and appropriate improvements, the landowner or developer shall notify
the Board of Supervisors, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of
the completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the Township Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall,
within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the
Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The
Township Engineer shall thereupon file a report, in writing, with the
Board of Supervisors and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the
landowner or developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall
be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the Township
Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Board of Supervisors.
Said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of
said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements
or any portion thereof shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the
Township Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for
such nonapproval or rejection.
B. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the landowner or developer within
15 days of receipt of the Township Engineer's report, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the action of the Board of Supervisors
with relation thereto.
C. If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements
will be deemed to have been approved and the landowner or developer
shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance guaranty
bond or other security agreement.
D. If any portion of said improvements shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the landowner or developer shall
proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
E. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
landowner's or developer's right to contest or question, by legal
proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the Board of
Supervisors or the Township Engineer.
§ 160-71 CONCORD CODE § 160-73
155:430
§ 160-74. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
In the event that any improvements which may be required under this
chapter have not been installed as provided in this chapter or in accordance
with the approved final plan, the Board of Supervisors may enforce the
bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the
proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered
by such bond or security, the Board of Supervisors may, at its option, install
or repair part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or
land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action
to recover from the land developer the moneys necessary to complete said
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from legal or equitable action brought against the landowner or developer
or both, shall be used solely for the installation of improvements covered by
such security.
§ 160-75. Dedication and acceptance of improvements.
Upon completion of the construction of improvements in accordance with
the approved subdivision and/or land development plan, the following
conditions shall apply to the offer of dedication of the same and the
acceptance thereof:
A. Within 30 days after completion of improvements and approval of the
same by the Township and before acceptance of such improvements,
the landowner or developer shall submit to the Board of Supervisors a
corrected set of as-built plans and profiles in accordance with § 160-17
and § 160-31. In the event that the as-built plan is not submitted in
complete and accurate form, all funds being withheld by means of a
completion guaranty shall not be released until such plan has been
satisfactorily completed.
B. The as-built plan shall be reproducible and drawn to the same scale as
the final plan, conservation plan and improvements construction plan
and shall be certified to by an engineer or surveyor and approved by the
Township Engineer.
C. Said Plan shall indicate the actual location, dimensions and/or
elevations of all completed improvements, including but not limited to
those set forth in § 160-31.
A. The Board of Supervisors shall have no obligation to take over and
make public any street or other improvement in or abutting a
subdivision or land development. If the Board of Supervisors elects to
accept an offer of dedication, such acceptance shall not occur unless
and until:
(1) The required improvements and monuments, as shown on the
approved subdivision and/or land development plan, conservation
plan and improvements construction plan, shall have been certified
§ 160-73 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-75
155:431
by the Township Engineer as having been constructed and installed
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and all other
ordinances, codes, regulations, plans and maps of the Township
and accurately delineated on an as-built plan.
(2) A maintenance guaranty is provided through the posting of
financial security, such as that deemed to be acceptable to the
Township as set forth in § 160-71A. Such guaranty shall assure the
structural integrity of required improvements, as well as the
functioning of said improvements, in accordance with the design
and specifications as depicted on the approved final plans for a
term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be in an amount equivalent
to 15% of the actual cost of installation of the required
improvements.
(3) A deed or deeds of dedication for all such improvements, prepared
and executed by the landowner or developer in accordance with
forms prescribed by the Board of Supervisors, shall have been
presented to the Board of Supervisors, together with a certificate
from the contractor or contractors evidencing the payment of all
labor and material costs and a policy of title insurance insuring the
fee title to said improvements as free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances and other objections to the title.
(4) At least 50% of all lots having access to the street has been
encompassed by completed dwellings, and the Board of
Supervisors shall determine that the public interest requires that
such improvements be accepted.
(5) Any offer of a deed of dedication must be accompanied by a
maintenance bond and the as-built plan(s) at least 90 days prior to
the anticipated date for the acceptance of the deed of dedication.
B. The Board of Supervisors shall have no responsibility with respect to
any improvements, notwithstanding any public use thereof, unless and
until such improvements are accepted for dedication by duly enacting
or adopting an ordinance or resolution therefor.

construction and placed on file.
§ 160-81. Modification of site and plan requirements.
The Planning Commission may recommend to the Board of Supervisors
that the site requirements of this chapter for a subdivision and/or land
development be modified or altered in order to encourage or promote
economy and ingenuity in the layout and design of subdivisions and land
development, to more effectively protect unique and/or sensitive natural
areas or to more effectively conform to the purposes of this chapter as
follows:
A. With respect to encouraging or promoting economy and ingenuity in
the layout and design of subdivisions and land developments, the
Planning Commission may recommend modifications to site
requirements for, but not limited to, the following types of proposals:
(1) Those which may involve earth-sheltered housing design.
(2) Those which may involve special forms of solar energy
conservation.
(3) Those which may involve the conversion, reuse and/or adaptation
of an existing structure or building.
(4) Utilization and layout of open space.
B. With respect to more effectively protecting various sensitive natural
areas, the Planning Commission may recommend modifications to site
requirements for, but not limited to, the following types of proposals:
(1) Those which would more effectively protect existing tree growth,
especially notable trees and tree masses with indigenous
vegetation.
(2) Those which would minimize extensive grading and the
displacement of soil.
§ 160-78 CONCORD CODE § 160-81
155:434
(3) Those which would enhance groundwater recharge.
(4) Those which would minimize surface water runoff and improve the
management of stormwater.
(5) Those which would preserve historic or cultural sites or structures.
(6) Those which would minimize visibility of development and protect
the visual quality of ridges and other exposed areas.
C. In granting modifications to the landowner or developer, the Board of
Supervisors may impose such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied
or modified.
D. In addition to the foregoing, one or more provisions of this chapter may
be modified by the Board of Supervisors upon recommendation of the
Planning Commission if the literal enforcement of the provisions will
exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the
land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to
the public interest and that the purpose and intent of this chapter is
observed.
(1) All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall
accompany and be a part of the preliminary or final plan
application for subdivision and/or land development. The request
shall state in full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or
hardship on which the request is based, the provision or provisions
of this chapter involved and the minimum modification necessary.
(2) The Planning Commission shall keep a written record of all action
on all requests for modifications.
(3) The Board of Supervisors may authorize a waiver of these
regulations. In granting any modification, the Board of Supervisors
shall prescribe any conditions that they deem necessary to or
desirable for the public interest. In making its findings, the Board
of Supervisors shall take into account the nature of the proposed
use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity and the
probable effect of the proposed subdivision and/or land
development upon traffic conditions, fire, police protection and
other utilities and services in the vicinity. No modification shall be
granted unless the Supervisors find:
(a) That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting
said property such that the strict application of the provisions
of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable
use of this land.
(b) That the modification is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant.
§ 160-81 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 160-81
155:435

deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following
applicants:

occupation with a primary place of employment within Concord Township
during the tax year. Each individual who exercises such privilege for any

provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the following

maintenance; reduction of property taxes; or property tax relief through

number of political subdivisions within which a person may be employed.
§ 170-10. Exemption and refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from

calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for the calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.

taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army

§ 170-8 CONCORD CODE § 170-10
166:452
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with Concord Township's
Tax Collector and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within Concord Township of less than $12,000 in
the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. The
exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the
employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within
Concord Township for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the
employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt
of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by
Concord Township or except as required by Subsection B(2), the
employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the
calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at
all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the
time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform
form provided by Concord Township.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by Concord Township that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within Concord
Township equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within Concord Township in an amount equal to or
in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall
withhold the local services tax from the person under Subsection
B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any

outstanding balance of tax due, and Concord Township may pursue
collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. Concord Township, in consultation with the Tax Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the General Municipal
Law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. Concord Township or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the Township of Concord, as well as those
employers located outside the Township of Concord but who engage in
business within the Township of Concord, is hereby required to collect
from each of the employees engaged by him or performing for him
within the Township of Concord and make a return and payment thereof
to the Tax Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to
deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether said
employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all
such services are performed within Concord Township.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest one
hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payrollperiod
basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For
purposes of this subsection, combined rate shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and Concord
Township.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
§ 170-10 CONCORD CODE § 170-11
166:454
§ 170-12. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of
the tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Tax Collector. If an
employer fails to file the return and pay the tax whether or not the employer
makes collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 170-13. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Tax Collector on or before the 30th day following the
end of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 170-14. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within Concord Township shall be required to comply with this
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. Concord Township shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to Concord Township if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 170-11B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 170-11 SWIMMING POOLS § 170-14

article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Tax Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 170-15. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 170-16. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of Concord Township but who perform services of any
type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within Concord
Township, do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
Concord Township. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within
Concord Township and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for
the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed person, and in the
event his or her tax is not paid, Concord Township shall have the option
of proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of
this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 170-17. (Reserved)
§ 170-18. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Tax Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors. It shall be the duty of the Tax Collector to accept and
receive payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the
amount received by him from each employer or self-employed person,
together with the date the tax was received.

§ 170-19. Suits for collection.
§ 170-20. Violations and penalties.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.
§ 170-21. Interpretation.
B. The Tax Collector is hereby charged with the administration of this
article and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to Township
approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate regulations relating to
the administration and enforcement of this article, including provisions
for the examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this
article, the examination and correction of any return made in
compliance with this article and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have
occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Collector
shall have the right to appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of
Rights under Act 50 of 1998.133
C. The Tax Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the Tax
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Tax Collector may sue for
the recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together
with interest and penalty.

ARTICLE II
Traffic-Calming Measures
[Adopted 9-1-2009 by Ord. No. 329]
§ 185-2. Intent.
The purpose of this article is to establish criteria and guidelines for the
installation of traffic-calming measures on Township-owned roadways. Such
measures are specifically designed to reduce the speed, but not necessarily
the volume, of motor vehicle traffic in residential areas, nor is their purpose
to move traffic to adjoining roadways. Traffic-calming measures shall also
consist of enforcement and education activities by the Pennsylvania State
Police Department.
§ 185-3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SPEED HUMP  Synonymous with "traffic-calming measure." A speed
hump is a raised hump in the pavement extending across the width of the
roadway at a right angle to the direction of the flow of traffic. A speed
table is considered an equal alternative to speed hump where deemed
appropriate per the Township Traffic Engineer.
§ 185-4. Policy for installation.
It is the policy of the Township to install speed humps on streets in
accordance with the procedures and criteria listed in §§ 185-5 and 185-6
herein.
§ 185-5. Application procedure.
A. Applicants may request that a study be conducted to construct speed
humps in a particular neighborhood. Requests shall be submitted in
writing, along with a petition described below, to the Board of
Supervisors for consideration at its next scheduled meeting.
B. Petition.
(1) All households on the affected street must be contacted by the
applicants and advised that speed humps are being considered for
their street.
(2) A signed petition must be submitted reflecting the support of at
least 90% of the households (determined by street address) on the
affected street i.e., the signature of one adult member of the
household is necessary.
(3) Support is also required from 90% of households located on streets
or cul-de-sacs whose only access is via the affected street i.e., the
signature of one adult member of the household is necessary.
§ 185-2 TRANSIENT RETAIL MERCHANTS § 185-6
176:495
§ 185-6. Criteria.
The following general criteria have been established as a means to limit the
use of speed humps to areas where they will be most effective and practical;
these criteria are subject to modification as recommended by the Township
Traffic Engineer:
§ 185-7. Recommendation and approval.
A. Speed humps will not be installed on state roadways or any roadway
classified higher than "local" within the Concord Township
Comprehensive Plan, as amended.
B. The legally posted speed limit on the street should not exceed 25 miles
per hour.
C. The minimum length of the street, or portion thereof, measured from
the nearest intersecting street, should be at least 1,000 feet.
D. The average vehicle speed (based upon the 85th percentile of the
speeds recorded during the traffic count) should not be less than five
miles per hour over the legally posted speed limit, which should be
determined by a speed study.
E. The distance between speed humps should not be less than 250 feet.
F. Speed humps should not be installed on hills or curves that could affect
the safe control of vehicles.
G. Speed humps should be no less than 12 feet in width.
H. Signs indicating "HUMP" should be installed in each direction at the
location of the hump and a sufficient distance before the hump to warn
approaching motorists. For increased visibility, reflective stripes should
be painted on the humps.
I. Pennsylvania's Traffic Calming Handbook, Penn Dot Pub. 383, as
revised, may be utilized by the Township Traffic Engineer in forming a
recommendation to the Board of Supervisors regarding any trafficcalming
measure.
A. All decisions regarding whether or not to recommend the installation of
speed humps shall be made by the Board of Supervisors in accordance
with the criteria contained herein.
B. All Township Traffic Engineer recommendations to install speed humps
in the petitioned area shall be subject to final approval of the Board of
Supervisors.

§ 187-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Concord Township
Engine Brake Ordinance."
§ 187-2. Legislative intent.
The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Concord, Delaware County,
Pennsylvania, finds, as a fact, that the operation of an engine brake on
a gasoline-powered or diesel-powered motor vehicle not equipped with
mufflers, or equipped with defective or modified exhaust mufflers, so as
to create excessive noise through the use of said engine brake, adversely
affects the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Concord
Township and, therefore, is a nuisance in fact.
§ 187-3. Use prohibited.
No gasoline-powered or diesel-powered motor vehicle shall be operated
on the streets, roads, alleys or highways within the Township of Concord
listed below utilizing, in said operation, an engine brake, without exhaust
mufflers, permitting excessive noise to be created by said motor vehicles
using the engine brake. The streets subject to this prohibition shall be as
follows:

emergency situation.
§ 187-5. Violations and penalties.
For each violation of the provisions of this chapter, unless another penalty
is specifically provided in the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code140, any person who
commits, permits, takes part in or assists in any such violation shall be
liable, upon conviction thereof in a summary proceeding, to pay a fine of
not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 for each offense, together with the
costs of prosecution. Each use of such engine brake in Concord Township
shall be considered a separate violation.

(1) Objectives. The single-family detached cluster development
concept is intended to permit flexibility in lot layout, lot size and
the efficient and economical placement of single-family detached
dwellings on lots. The purpose of this section is to permit such
flexibility and to apply such criteria as will result in single-family
detached dwellings with:
(a) A pattern of development that preserves trees, outstanding
natural topographic and geologic features, and historic and
scenic resources, and prevents soil erosion.
(b) A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development.
(c) An environment of a similar character to adjacent and
surrounding developed areas.
(d) Permanent open space. Open spaces, as approved by the
Township on cluster development site plans, shall not be
further subdivided or used for any other purpose than open
space.
(e) A contiguous network of interconnected open spaces, which
links with open spaces within the tract and to neighboring
tracts of existing or proposed open space.
(2) Plans must meet the following conditions:
(a) Clustering is confined to single-family detached dwellings.
(b) Single-family detached cluster development shall not involve a
tract of land of less than 10 acres of net lot area.
(c) The tract of land to be developed shall be in one ownership or,
if owned by more than one entity, shall be the subject of an
application filed jointly by the owners of the entire tract, and it
shall be agreed that the tract shall be developed under single
direction and in the manner approved.
(d) Public water and public sewer shall be provided. No sewage
disposal systems for servicing dwelling units shall be located in
open space areas or floodplains.
(e) The maximum number of lots shall not exceed one dwelling
unit per acre, provided a minimum of 40% open space is
provided. However, minimum lot areas for single-family
detached dwellings shall be exclusive of the features listed in
the definition of "lot area".

(c) Coordination with environment. In addition to the
requirements contained in Chapter 160, Subdivision and Land
Development, the site plan shall show a pattern of
development which preserves trees, outstanding natural
topography and geologic features, and historic and scenic
resources, prevents soil erosion, and which provides an
interconnected network of open spaces. The Board of
Supervisors may request the applicant to provide, in support of
the application, surveys and maps concerning the existing and
proposed traffic conditions, topographic conditions and
grading, other ground features, hydrologic conditions, soils,
historic resources and visual resources, and methods to

site, connection to it shall be mandatory, and the cost of the
eventual interconnection shall be borne by the developer or the
organization that is set up to own and operate the satellite system.
(5) If, after development occurs, the satellite water system is deemed
to be the cause of interference with existing water supplies or the
satellite sewer system is deemed to be the cause of any pollution,
extension of the centralized or public systems may be required at
that time. The cost of the extension and hookup shall be borne by
the developer or organization owning and operating the satellite
system.
I. Any tract intended for a mobile home development must have direct
access to a collector type road (or a road of a higher classification), as
§ 210-59 CONCORD CODE § 210-59
196:610
defined by the Township Comprehensive Plan or Ultimate Right-of-
Way Ordinance, which the Board of Supervisors deems capable of
accommodating the transport of mobile home units, upon
recommendation of the Township Engineer. Plans evidencing provision
of safe and efficient ingress and egress to and from the public streets
and highways servicing the mobile home development district, without
causing undue confusion or interference with the normal traffic flows,
shall be submitted to the Board of Supervisors and must be approved by
the Township Engineer, who shall make the determination based on the
adequacy of the thoroughfare to carry the additional traffic generated
by the mobile home development. The applicant shall demonstrate to

regulations promulgated thereunder.
A. Mobile homes.
(1) Setback from tract boundary. No mobile home or other primary
building may be located closer than 75 feet to any boundary of a
mobile home development regardless of whether that boundary
abuts a lot, water body, road or other right-of-way. In the event that
a mobile home development abuts another such development, this
provision will not apply unless said abutting mobile home
developments are separated by a public highway; however, all
other applicable setbacks prescribed herein shall apply. Should two
abutting mobile home developments be separated by a public
highway, then the seventy-five-foot setback requirement shall
apply.
(2) Lot area. All mobile home lots in a mobile home development,
regardless of tenure, shall have a minimum lot size of 5,000 square
feet, when on-lot parking is provided, excluding the area of any
private driveway to a rear lot, except that this may be reduced to no
less than 4,500 square feet when common parking is provided.
(3) Lot width. No individual mobile home lot shall be less than 55 feet
in width at the building setback line, although this may be reduced
to 45 feet where roofed additions are prohibited or where the
applicant can demonstrate that roofed additions can be added
without violating the provisions of Subsections A(5)(a) and B
herein. No individual mobile home lot shall be less than 25 feet in
width at the right-of-way line of a public street or the equivalent
right-of-way line or the edge of the pavement of a private street,
measured 50 feet from the center line of a public or private street
or right-of-way, as applicable. [Amended 3-5-1991 by Ord. No.
177]
(4) Building area. The maximum coverage of any individual mobile
home lot by all primary and accessory buildings and structures,
including covered patios or decks, shall be not greater than 25%.
(5) Minimum structure setbacks.
(a) Front yard. In no case shall the long side of a mobile home, or
any side of another primary building or accessory use, be
located closer than 50 feet from the center line of a public or
private street or right-of-way; provided, however, that the short
side of a mobile home may be located no closer to the ultimate
right-of-way than 15 feet. No more than six homes in a row
§ 210-59 CONCORD CODE § 210-60
196:612
shall have the same setback; where varied setbacks are
utilized, the difference shall be at least four feet.
(b) Side and rear yards.
[1] No mobile home or accessory building may be located
closer than four feet to any side or rear lot line of an
individual mobile home lot; provided, however, that all
minimum requirements of Subsection B below must be
met.
[2] Mobile homes placed on individual lots are encouraged to
utilize the minimal setbacks specified in Subsection
A(5)(b) and to be placed off center on the lots so as to
provide a large usable open yard space and outdoor living
area in one section of the lot. [Amended 3-5-1991 by
Ord. No. 177]
(6) Height. No structure built in a Mobile Home Development District
shall exceed a height of two stories or a maximum of 25 feet.
B. Conventionally built and modular homes. Relative to the required lot
size and setback requirements of the R-1 District, the lot size required
for conventionally built and modular homes in the R-MHD District may
be reduced a maximum of 25% and the lot width and yard setbacks may
be reduced a maximum of 15%. All other requirements applicable to
mobile homes as specified in Subsection A above remain applicable to
modular homes and conventionally built single-family homes.
C. Residential adult community. An adult residential community shall
comply with the yard and area regulations for mobile homes set forth in
§ 210-60A, except where otherwise provided below: [Added
1-12-1999 by Ord. No. 233]
(1) Setback from tract boundary. Where the primary buildings in an
adult residential community will parallel the boundary of the
mobile home development, the setback may be reduced to 55 feet.
In addition, should two mobile home developments which
substantially abut one another, both of which are adult residential
communities, be separated by a public highway, then the seventyfive-
foot setback requirements from the highway may be reduced to
55 feet from the highway.
(2) Building area. The maximum building coverage of any individual
mobile home lot in an adult residential community by all primary
and accessory buildings and structures, including covered patios or
covered decks, may be increased to not more than 40% if a garage
is built on the lot, provided that the maximum building coverage of
the adult residential community development as a whole does not
exceed 25%. Driveway areas, unroofed patios and unroofed decks
shall not be included in calculating the coverage of either an
§ 210-60 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-60
196:613
individual mobile home lot or the adult residential community
development.
(3) Minimum front yard structure setbacks. In no case shall the long
side of a mobile home, or any side of another primary building or

public or private street or right-of-way; provided, however, that the
short side of a mobile home may be located no closer to the
ultimate right-of-way than 15 feet. No more than eight mobile
homes in a row (unless faced parallel to the street) shall have the
same setback; where varied setbacks are utilized, the difference
shall be at least four feet.
D. Adult residential community of modular homes. An adult residential
community consisting exclusively of modular homes shall comply with
all applicable yard and area regulations set forth in § 210-60A, B and C
and § 210-61A and B, except where otherwise provided below: [Added
4-3-2001 by Ord. No. 257]
(1) Lot width. Eighty percent of the individual lots within an adult
residential community consisting exclusively of modular homes
shall be at least 55 feet in width at the building setback line. The
width of the remaining 20% of the individual lots may be reduced to
30 feet at the building setback line.
(2) Building area. The maximum building coverage on the individual
lots by all primary and accessory buildings and structures,
including covered patios or covered decks, within an adult
residential community consisting exclusively of modular homes
may be increased to not more than 55%, provided that the
maximum building coverage of the development as a whole does
not exceed 25%. Driveway areas, unroofed patios and unroofed
decks shall not be included in calculating the building coverage of
either an individual lot or the overall development.
(3) Minimum front yard structure setbacks. In no case shall the long
side of a modular home within an adult residential community
consisting exclusively of modular homes be located closer to the
legal right-of-way of any road than 15 feet. In the event that the

use shall be located within 25 feet of any common parking area.
B. Distance between structures.
(1) Mobile homes and roofed structures of areas attached thereto shall
be separated from each other, and from other buildings and
structures, other than accessory structures, at their closest points
by a minimum of 20 feet; provided, however, that whenever two
mobile homes have their longer sides parallel or essentially parallel
to each other for more than 25% of the length of either, the
minimum distance between the two mobile homes shall be 30 feet.
The sides shall be considered essentially parallel if they form an
angle of less than 45° when extended to intersect.
(2) Mobile homes and roofed structures of areas attached thereto in an
adult residential community shall be separated from each other,
and from other buildings and structures, other than accessory
structures, at their closest points by a minimum of 20 feet.
Provided further, however, that where an attached accessory
structure, such as a garage, parallels the longer walls of a mobile
home or accessory structure on an adjacent lot, the minimum
distance between two structures (whether primary or accessory)
may be 10 feet, but only for one wall of an accessory structure
which shall not exceed 27 feet. The sides shall be considered
essentially parallel if they form an angle of less than 45° when
extended to intersect. Unroofed patios and decks shall not be
considered to be a structure or an accessory structure for the

[Amended 2-4-1986 by Ord. No. 148]
§ 210-68. Purposes.
The purposes are:
§ 210-69. (Reserved)178
A. To recognize the need for rational direction for increasing land
development and to meet the growing need for housing of all types,
while at the same time minimize the loss of open countryside; to
preserve the atmosphere of the Township; to forestall inadequacies in
community services and facilities; and to protect property values in
existing residential areas.
B. To encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so
that the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in
type, design and layout of dwellings and by conservation and more
efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings.
C. To provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation for
all who are or will be residents of the Township.
D. To encourage a more efficient use of land and public services and to
reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the
economies so secured may enure to the benefit of those who need
homes.
E. To encourage more flexible land development which will respect and
conserve natural resources such as streams, lakes, floodplains,
groundwater, wooded areas, steeply sloped areas and areas of unusual
beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem.
F. In aid of these purposes, to provide a procedure which can relate the
type, design and layout of residential development to the particular site
and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of
development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the
property values within existing residential areas and to assure that the
increased flexibility of regulations over land development established
hereby is carried out pursuant to sound, expeditious and fair
administrative standards and procedures and to design the abovementioned
procedure so that it permits higher densities in the areas
recognized in the Comprehensive Plan as most capable of receiving and
supporting such densities.

and crown characteristics, susceptibility and dieback.
(b) Susceptibility to insect and disease infestation and air
pollution.
(c) Species longevity.
(d) Wind firmness and suitability of plant material to soil types.
(e) Wildlife values (ability of plant material such as oak, hickory,
dogwood and walnut to provide food for bird and animal life).
(f) Trees and shrubs which are prone to cause pavement heaving
or whose roots have a tendency to invade water and sewer
lines (i.e., poplar, willow, silver and Norway maple, beech) shall
not be planted where their presence will result in pavement
heaving or the clogging of mains and drains.
(g) Where land is open or barren, the planting of trees is
encouraged.
(4) The protection of trees of eight-inch caliper or over measured 4.5
feet off the ground shall be a factor in determining the location of

of natural amenities. Natural features, such as lakes, streams and
wooded slopes, shall be preserved and incorporated into the final
landscaping of the development, wherever possible and desirable.
The applicant shall demonstrate the means whereby trees and
other natural features shall be protected during construction.
Wherever possible, scenic points, historic spots and other
community assets and landmarks shall be preserved.
(6) Seeding, sodding and other planting shall be applied to stabilize
topsoil on steep slopes and to enhance the appearance of open
space. This program must be approved by the Soil Conservation
District of the Federal Soil Conservation Service. Excessive cuts
and fills shall be avoided. Topsoil shall not be stripped, covered or
removed from the development site.
(7) Erosion control measures, such as minimizing the areas of exposed
soil, mulching, building silt catchment basins and planting
temporary ground cover, shall be instituted as necessary. All
construction, including grading and regrading, shall be
accomplished under and in accordance with the conservation plan
required by § 210-77A of this article. Where adequate surface
drainage is not possible by grading alone, a supplementary
drainage system, approved by the Township Engineer, will be
required.
(8) All parking areas shall be landscaped. The interior of each lot shall
have one two-inch-caliper shade tree for every four cars.
(9) Wherever the site is not naturally wooded, shade trees shall be
provided along all streets. No fewer than two two-inch-caliper trees
measured 4.5 feet off the ground shall be planted for each twentyfive-
foot section of collector streets. For the purpose of these
regulations, street trees are limited to the following: honey locust,
red oak, columnar-type maples, sugar maple and sweet gum.
(10) Subject to the approval of the review agency, the planting strip or
utility strip between the curb and sidewalk may be moved and
placed into an acceptable public park area on an equal basis,
resulting in an integral curb, gutter and sidewalk treatment where
this is accomplished. Where integral curb, gutter and sidewalk is
permitted, a planting and utility easement shall be required. The
combined dimension of such sidewalk and planting and utility
easement together shall not exceed the residual dimension of road
right-of-way measured from the back of the curb to the right-of-way
line for each side, respectively. Such integral treatment shall,
however, not be permitted on arterial or collector thoroughfares.
Areas within planting strips cannot be used to enable larger lot
sizes or used for park purposes.

open space land; or
(c) Provide for and establish one or more organizations for the
ownership and maintenance of all common open space.
(2) In the case of Subsection A(1)(c) above, each organization shall be
a nonprofit homeowners' corporation, unless the developer
demonstrates that a community open space trust is a more
appropriate form of organization.
B. If a homeowners' association or open space trust is formed, it shall be
governed according to the following regulations:
(1) The organization is organized by the developer and operating with
financial subsidization by the developer, if necessary, before the
sale of any lots within the development.
§ 210-74 CONCORD CODE § 210-75
196:640
(2) Membership in the organization is mandatory for all purchasers of
dwelling units therein and their successors.
(3) The organization shall be responsible for maintenance of and
insurance and taxes on common open space.
(4) The members of the organization shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining and developing common open space, in accordance
with procedures established by them.
(5) The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and maintain the common open space.
(6) Maintenance.
(a) In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain a common open space, or any successor organization,
shall at any time after establishment of the planned residential
development fail to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the Township may serve written notice upon
such organization or upon the residents and owners of the
planned residential development setting forth the manner in
which the organization has failed to maintain the common open
space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within
30 days thereof and shall state the date and place of a hearing
thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At
such hearing the Township may modify the terms of the
original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension
of time within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies set
forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof shall
not be cured within said 30 days or any extension thereof, the
Township, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the planned residential development and to
prevent the common open space from becoming a public
nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and
maintain the same for a period of one year. Said entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
common open space except when the same is voluntarily
dedicated to the public by the residents and owners. Before the
expiration of said year the Township shall, upon its initiative or
upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible
for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public
hearing upon notice to such organizations or to the residents
and owners of the planned residential development, who shall
show cause why such maintenance by the Township shall not,
at the election of the Township, continue for a succeeding year.
If the Township shall determine that such organization is ready
and able to maintain said common open space in reasonable
condition, the Township shall cease to maintain said common
§ 210-75 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-75
196:641
open space at the end of said year. If the Township shall
determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain
said common open space in a reasonable condition, the
Township may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said
common open space during the next succeeding year and
subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year
thereafter. The decision of the Township shall be subject to
appeal to court in the same manner, and within the same
time limitations, as is provided for zoning appeals by the
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.184185
(b) The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the planned
residential development that have a right of enjoyment of the
common open space and shall become a tax lien on said
properties. Said assessments or charges shall be subordinate
in lien to the lien of any mortgage or mortgages on the
property which is subject to such assessments or charges
regardless of when said mortgage or mortgages were created
or when such assessments or charges accrued, provided that
such subordination shall apply only to assessments or charges
that have become payable prior to the passing of title under
foreclosure of such mortgage or mortgages, and the transferee
shall not be liable for payment of any assessments or charges
accruing prior to said foreclosure, but nothing herein shall be
held to affect the right herein given to enforce the collection of
such assessments or charges accruing after sale under
foreclosure of such mortgage or mortgages; and provided,
further, that such charges accruing after sale shall also be
subordinate in lien to the lien of any further mortgage or
mortgages which are placed on property subject to such
assessments or charges, with the intent that no such charges
shall at any time be prior to lien or any mortgage or mortgages
whatsoever on such property. The Township, at the time of
entering upon said common open space for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the office of the
Prothonotary of the county upon the properties affected by
such lien within the planned residential development.
(7) In accordance with Section 706 of Act 247,186 the provisions of the
development plan relating to the use, bulk and location of buildings
and structures, the quantity and location of common open space
and the intensity of use or the density of residential units shall run
in favor of the Township and shall be enforceable in law or in equity
by the Township, without limitation on any powers or regulation
otherwise granted the Township by law. The development plan shall

specify those of its provisions which shall run in favor of and be
enforceable by residents of the planned residential development
and, in addition, the manner in which such residents may modify or
release such rights.
C. The Township will consider floodplain land as particularly suitable for
dedication for public use for such purposes as walking and bridle paths.
While the Township is open to the dedication of land involving historic
sites and properties, it is also agreeable to the consideration of
imaginative use of such historic site and/or property by the developer or

tentatively approved plan and are of such size and location that they
constitute economically sound units of development. In no event shall
such stages contain less than 15% of the dwelling units receiving
tentative approval.
E. Gross residential density may be varied from stage to stage; provided,
however, that final approval shall not be given to any stage if the gross
residential density by type of dwelling of the area which includes stages
already finally approved and the stage for which final approval is being
sought exceeds by more than 10% the gross residential density for each
type of dwelling unit allowed for the entire planned residential
development in the tentatively approved plan. Where it is necessary to
allocate open space to early stages to avoid exceeding maximum gross
residential densities, the developer may be required to grant an open
space easement or covenant to the Township specifying the amount
and, if necessary, the location of open space.
A. Prior to application for tentative approval, the findings of the natural
features analysis and the community impact analysis of the site
explained in § 210-74A(1) and B(1) will be presented to the Board of

systems is contemplated, projections as to the required water
supply capacity and wastewater volumes generated by the PRD
shall also be included.
A. The application for tentative approval shall be executed by or on behalf
of the landowner and filed with the Township Secretary. An initial
deposit in the amount as set forth from time to time by resolution of the
Board of Supervisors shall be paid upon filing of the application to be
applied against such expenses, and additional deposits shall be made
from time to time as requested by the Township to be applied against
the expenses of processing the application, not to exceed actual
expenses incurred by the Township.187
B. The application for tentative approval shall include documentation
illustrating compliance with all of the standards for planned residential
development in § 210-74, and where necessary, the Board shall order
such documentation to aid it in its review.
C. Required documentation shall include but not be limited to documents
illustrating the following:

(1) In the event of such refusal, the landowner may either:
(a) Refile his application for final approval without the variations
objected; or
(b) File a written request with the Board of Supervisors that it hold
a public hearing on his application for final approval.
(2) If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action he may
do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final

or reconstruction shall be specified by the Board of Supervisors as
necessary by reasons of faulty construction, workmanship or
materials.
(4) To pay all costs, charges or rates of the utility furnishing electric
service for the streetlighting facilities installed by the developer

shall have been accepted or condemned by the Township for public
use and to indemnify and save harmless the Township from and
against all suits, actions, claims and demands for electric service
as aforesaid, or any part thereof, to the time that said streets
shall be accepted or condemned as public streets in the manner
hereinabove set forth.
(5) To post contemporaneous with the execution of such agreement a
bond, with corporate surety approved by the Township Supervisors,
in such amount not less than 110% of the cost of all improvements,

Township Solicitor), conditioned upon the developer's proper
completion of the improvements as set forth in Subsection A hereof
and the developer's maintenance and repair of the same for the
period of 18 months following completion.194

A. To recognize the need for rational direction for increasing land
development and to meet the growing need for housing of all types,
while at the same time to minimize the loss of open countryside, to
preserve the atmosphere of the Township, to forestall inadequacies in
community services and facilities and to protect property values in
existing residential areas.
B. To encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so
that the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in
type or design and layout of dwellings and by conservation and more
efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings.
C. To provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation for
all who are or will be residents of the Township.
D. To encourage a more efficient use of land and public services and to
reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the
economies so secured may enure to the benefit of those who need
homes.
E. To encourage more flexible land development which will respect and
conserve natural resources such as streams, lakes, floodplains,
groundwater, wooded areas, steeply sloped areas and areas of unusual
beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem.
F. In aid of these purposes, to provide a procedure which can relate the
type, design and layout of residential development to the particular site
and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of
development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the
property values within existing residential areas and to assure that the
increased flexibility of regulations over land development established
hereby is carried out pursuant to sound, expeditious and fair
administrative standards and procedures and to design the abovementioned
procedure so that it permits higher densities in the areas
recognized in the Comprehensive Plan as most capable of receiving and
supporting such densities.

development. Where possible, it shall be designed as a contiguous
area easily accessible to the residents, and preserving and
enhancing natural features.
(2) Areas set aside for open space shall be suitable for the designated
purpose and in any event shall be consistent with the plan policy for
future land use in the Township. Any such area shall contain no
structure other than a structure related to the purposes of open
spaces.
I. Fire lanes and hydrants.
(1) No dwelling unit or part of a unit shall be located more than 200
feet from a duly improved and accessible fire lane, as defined

A. There shall be provisions which ensure that the open space land shall
continue as such and be properly maintained.
§ 210-90 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-91
196:675
(1) The developer shall either:
(a) Dedicate such land to public use if the Township or another
public agency has indicated it will accept such dedication;
(b) Retain ownership and responsibility for maintenance of such
open space land; or
(c) Provide for and establish one or more organizations for the
ownership and maintenance of all common open space.
(2) In the case of Subsection A(1)(c) above, each organization shall be
a nonprofit homeowners' corporation, unless the developer
demonstrates that a community open space trust is a more
appropriate form of organization.
B. If a homeowners' association or open space trust is formed, it shall be
governed according to the following regulations:
(1) The organization is organized by the developer and operating with
financial subsidization by the developer, if necessary, before the
sale of any lots within the development.
(2) Membership in the organization is mandatory for all purchasers of
dwelling units therein and their successors.
(3) The organization shall be responsible for maintenance of and
insurance and taxes on common open space.
(4) The members of the organization shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining and developing common open space, in accordance
with procedures established by them.
(5) The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and maintain the common open space.
(6) Maintenance.
(a) In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain a common open space, or any successor organization,
shall at any time after establishment of the planned residential
development fail to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the Township may serve written notice upon
such organization or upon the residents and owners of the
planned residential development setting forth the manner in
which the organization has failed to maintain the common open
space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within
30 days thereof and shall state the date and place of a hearing
thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At
such hearing, the Township may modify the terms of the
original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension
§ 210-91 CONCORD CODE § 210-91
196:676
of time within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies
set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof
shall not be cured within said 30 days or any extension thereof,
the Township, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the planned residential development and to
prevent the common open space from becoming a public
nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and
maintain the same for a period of one year. Said entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use
the common open space except when the same is voluntarily
dedicated to the public by the residents and owners. Before the
expiration of said year the Township shall, upon its initiative
or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible
for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public
hearing upon notice to such organizations or to the residents
and owners of the planned residential development, who shall
show cause why such maintenance by the Township shall not,
at the election of the Township, continue for a succeeding year.
If the Township shall determine that such organization is ready
and able to maintain said common open space in reasonable
condition, the Township shall cease to maintain said common
open space at the end of said year. If the Township shall
determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain
said common open space in a reasonable condition, the
Township may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said
common open space during the next succeeding year and
subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year
thereafter. The decision of the Township shall be subject to
appeal to court in the same manner, and within the same
time limitations, as is provided for zoning appeals by the
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.203
(b) The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the planned
residential development that have a right of enjoyment of the
common open space and shall become a tax lien on said
properties. Said assessments or charges shall be subordinate
in lien to the lien of any mortgage or mortgages on the
property which is subject to such assessments or charges
regardless of when said mortgage or mortgages were created
or when such assessments or charges accrued, provided that
such subordination shall apply only to assessments or charges
that have become payable prior to the passing of title under
foreclosure of such mortgage or mortgages, and the transferee
shall not be liable for payment of any assessments or charges
accruing prior to said foreclosure, but nothing herein shall be
held to affect the right herein given to enforce the collection of

§ 210-91 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-91
196:677
§ 210-92. Development in stages.
A developer may construct a planned residential development in stages if
the following criteria are met:
such assessments or charges accruing after sale under
foreclosure of such mortgage or mortgages; and provided,
further, that such charges accruing after sale shall also be
subordinate in lien to the lien of any further mortgage or
mortgages which are placed on property subject to such
assessments or charges, with the intent that no such charges
shall at any time be prior to lien or any mortgage or mortgages
whatsoever on such property. The Township, at the time of
entering upon said common open space for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the office of
the Prothonotary of the county, upon the properties affected by
such lien within the planned residential development.
(7) In accordance with Section 706 of Act 247,204 the provisions of the
development plan relating to the use, bulk and location of buildings
and structures, the quantity and location of common open space
and the intensity of use or the density of residential units shall run
in favor of the Township and shall be enforceable in law or in equity
by the Township, without limitation on any powers or regulation
otherwise granted the Township by law. The development plan shall
specify those of its provisions which shall run in favor of and be
enforceable by residents of the planned residential development
and, in addition, the manner in which such residents may modify or
release such rights.
C. The Township will consider floodplain land as particularly suitable for
dedication for public use for such purposes as walking and bridle paths.
While the Township is open to the dedication of land involving historic
sites and properties, it is also agreeable to the consideration of
imaginative use of such historic site and/or property by the developer or
by a homeowners' association.
A. The application for tentative approval covers the entire planned
residential development and shows the location and approximate time
of construction for each stage, in addition to other information required
by this article.
B. At least 15% of the dwelling units in the plan given tentative approval
are included in the first stage.
C. At least 33% of the dwelling units in any stage are rented or sold before
any commercial development shown in that stage shall be completed.

196:678
§ 210-93. Feasibility review.
§ 210-94. Application for tentative approval.
D. The second and subsequent stages are completed consistent with the
tentatively approved plan and are of such size and location that they
constitute economically sound units of development. In no event shall
such stages contain less than 15% of the dwelling units receiving
tentative approval.
E. Gross residential density may be varied from stage to stage; provided,
however, that final approval shall not be given to any stage if the gross
residential density by type of dwelling of the area which includes stages
already finally approved and the stage for which final approval is being
sought exceeds by more than 10% the gross residential density for each
type of dwelling unit allowed for the entire planned residential
development in the tentatively approved plan. Where it is necessary to
allocate open space to early stages to avoid exceeding maximum gross
residential densities, the developer may be required to grant an open
space easement or covenant to the Township specifying the amount
and, if necessary, the location of open space.
A. Prior to application for tentative approval, the findings of the natural
features analysis and the community impact analysis of the site
explained in § 210-90A(1) and B(1) will be presented to the Board of
Supervisors. The review will not affect the application procedures of the
applicant but is intended to thoroughly familiarize both the applicant
and the review agency with the potential of the site for planned
residential development.
B. Materials illustrating the following information will be presented at the
review:
(1) A site map or maps at one inch equals 100 feet illustrating the
hydrology, geology, soils, topography and vegetation of the site as
explained in § 210-90B(2). The combined impact of the natural
features upon the development potential of each specific area of
the site will be clearly illustrated on the map.
(2) Materials indicating the impact of the completed planned
residential development upon public facilities, utilities and
roadway systems. Projections as to the number of school children
in the PRD and the vehicular traffic generated by the PRD shall be
included. Where connection to public water supply and sewer
systems is contemplated, projections as to the required water
supply capacity and wastewater volumes generated by the PRD
shall also be included.
A. The application for tentative approval shall be executed by or on behalf
of the landowner and filed with the Township Secretary. An initial
deposit in the amount as set forth from time to time by resolution of the
§ 210-92 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-94
196:679
Board of Supervisors shall be paid upon filing of the application to
be applied against such expenses, and additional deposits shall be
made from time to time as requested by the Township to be applied
against the expenses of processing the application, not to exceed actual
expenses incurred by the Township.205
B. The application for tentative approval shall include documentation
illustrating compliance with all of the standards for planned residential
development in § 210-90, and where necessary the Board shall order
such documentation to aid it in its review.
C. Required documentation shall include, but not be limited to, documents
illustrating the following:
(1) The location and size of the area involved and adjoining areas; and
the nature of the landowner's interest in the planned residential
development.
(2) The proposed use areas and the net residential and commercial
density of each proposed land use.

to be imposed upon the use of land, buildings and structures,
including proposed grants and/or easement for public utilities.
(8) The provision for parking of vehicles and locations, rights-of-way
and cartway widths of proposed streets and public ways.
(9) In the case of plans which call for development in stages, a
schedule showing the time within which applications for final
approval of all parts of the planned residential development are
intended to be filed, and which shall be updated annually on the
anniversary of submission for final approval.
(10) The application shall, insofar as possible, indicate compliance with
the provisions set forth herein, governing the requirements for
final approval.
D. Application for tentative approval shall include but not be limited to the
following documents:

E. Said application shall also include a written statement by the landowner
setting forth the reasons why, in his opinion, the planned residential
development would be in the public interest and would be consistent
with the Township's Comprehensive Plan.
F. One copy of every application for tentative approval received by the
Township Secretary shall be promptly forwarded to the Township
Planning Commission and to the Delaware County Planning
Commission for study and recommendation as required by the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.206 The Township Planning
Commission and the Delaware County Planning Commission shall
review and report upon the application to the Board within 30 days of
such referral. One copy of the reports of the respective Planning
Commissions shall be furnished to the landowner not less than five days
before appointed time of this public hearing provided for in § 210-95 of
this article.
G. The landowner, the Board of Supervisors, the Township Planning
Commission and the Delaware County Planning Commission may

§ 210-96. The findings.
A. Within 60 days after the filing of an application for tentative approval of
a planned residential development pursuant to this article, a public
hearing pursuant to public notice on said application shall be held by
the Board of Supervisors in the manner prescribed in the Concord
Township Zoning Ordinance for the enactment of an amendment.207 The
Chairman or, in his absence, the Acting Chairman of the Board of
Supervisors or its designated agency may administer oaths and compel
the attendance of witnesses. All testimony by witnesses at any hearing
shall be given under oath and every party of record at a hearing shall
have the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses.
B. A verbatim record of the hearing shall be caused to be made by the
Board of Supervisors whenever such records are requested by any
party to the proceedings; but the cost of making and transcribing such a
record shall be borne by the party requesting it and the expense of
copies of such record shall be borne by those who wish to obtain such
copies. All exhibits accepted in evidence shall be identified and duly
preserved or, if not accepted in evidence, shall be properly identified
and the reason for the exclusion clearly noted in the record.
A. 208The Board of Supervisors within 60 days following the conclusion of
the public hearing provided for in this article shall, by official written
communication to the landowner, either grant tentative approval of the
development plan as submitted, grant tentative approval subject to
specified conditions not included in the development plan as submitted
or deny tentative approval to the development plan. Failure to so act
within said period shall be a grant of tentative approval of the
development plan as submitted. In the event, however, that tentative
approval is granted subject to conditions, the landowner may, within 30
days after receiving a copy of the official written communication of the
Board of Supervisors, notify such Board of Supervisors of his refusal to
accept all said conditions, in which case, the Board of Supervisors shall
be deemed to have denied tentative approval of the development plan.
In the event that the landowner does not, within said period, notify the
Board of Supervisors of his refusal to accept all said conditions,
tentative approval of the development plan, with all said conditions,
shall stand as granted.
B. The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of
fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for
the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said
communication shall set forth with particularity in what respects the
development plan would or would not be in the public interest,

including but not limited to findings of fact and conclusions on the
following:
(1) Those respects in which the development plan is or is not
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of the
municipality.
(2) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and

reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be in the
public interest.
(3) The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the
planned residential development, the reliability of the proposals for
maintenance and conservation of the common open space and the
adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common
open space as related to the proposed density and type of
residential development.
(4) The physical design of the development plan and the manner in
which said design does or does not make adequate provision for
public services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic and
further the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual
enjoyment.
(5) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed residential
development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be
established.
(6) In the case of a development plan which proposes development
over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions

development plan.
C. In the event that a development plan is granted tentative approval, with
or without conditions, the Board of Supervisors may set forth in the
official written communication the time within which an application for
final approval of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a
development plan which provides for development over a period of
years, the periods of time within which applications for final approval of
each part thereof shall be filed. Except upon the consent of the
landowner, the time so established between grant of tentative approval
and application for final approval shall not be less than three months
and, in case of development over a period of years, the time between
applications for final approval of each part of a plan shall be not less

Zoning Map and in the records of the Secretary of the Township.
A. An application for final approval may be for all the land included in a
development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative approval, a
section thereof. Said application shall be made to the Township
Supervisors and within the time or times specified by the official written
communication granting tentative approval. If the application for final

not offered for dedication and not required to be offered for
dedication, he shall submit a copy of statements cosigned by
the Township Solicitor that he has made an agreement on
behalf of his heirs and assigns with the Township. Said

together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in
support thereof, and as required by this article and the official written
communication of tentative approval, the Township shall, within 45
days of such filing, grant such development plan final approval.211
D. 212In the event that the development plan an submitted contains
variations from the development plan given tentative approval, the
Board of Supervisors may refuse to grant final approval and shall,
within 45 days from the filing of the application for final approval, so
advise the landowner, in writing, of said refusal, setting forth in said
notice the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the
public interest.

(6) Maintenance.
(a) In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain a common open space, or any successor organization,
shall at any time after establishment of the planned active
adult community fail to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the Township may serve written notice upon
such organization or upon the residents and owners of the
planned active adult community setting forth the manner in
which the organization has failed to maintain the common open
space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within
30 days thereof and shall state the date and place of a hearing
thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At
such hearing, the Township may modify the terms of the
original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension
of time within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies set
forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof shall
not be cured within said 30 days or any extension thereof, the
Township, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the planned active adult community and to
prevent the common open space from becoming a public
nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and
maintain the same for a period of one year. Said entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
common open space except when the same is voluntarily
dedicated to the public by the residents and owners. Before the
expiration of said year the Township shall, upon its initiative or
upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible
for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public
hearing upon notice to such organizations or to the residents
and owners of the planned active adult community, who shall
show cause why such maintenance by the Township shall not,
at the election of the Township, continue for a succeeding year.
If the Township shall determine that such organization is ready
and able to maintain said common open space in reasonable
conditions, the Township shall cease to maintain said common
open space at the end of said year. If the Township shall
determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain
said common open space in a reasonable condition, the
Township may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said
common open space during the next succeeding year and
subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year
thereafter. The decision of the Township shall be subject to
appeal to court in the same manner and within the same time
§ 210-107 CONCORD CODE § 210-107
196:708
limitations as is provided for zoning appeals by the
Municipalities Planning Code.224 225
(b) The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the planned
active adult community that have a right of enjoyment of the
common open space and shall become a tax lien on said
properties. Said assessments or charges shall be subordinate
in lien to the lien of any mortgage or mortgages on the
property which is subject to such assessments or charges
regardless of when said mortgage or mortgages were created
or when such assessments or charges accrued, provided that
such subordination shall apply only to assessments or charges
that have become payable prior to the passing of title under
foreclosure of such mortgage or mortgages, and the transferee
shall not be liable for payment of any assessments or charges
accruing prior to said foreclosure, but nothing herein shall be
held to affect the right herein given to enforce the collection of
such assessments or charges accruing after sale under
foreclosure of such mortgage or mortgages; and provided,
further, that such charges accruing after sale shall also be
subordinate in lien to the lien of any further mortgage or
mortgages which are placed on property subject to such
assessments or charges, with the intent that no such charges
shall at any time be prior to lien of any mortgage or mortgages
whatsoever on such property. The Township, at the time of
entering upon said common open space for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the office of the
Prothonotary of the county upon the properties affected by
such lien within the planned active adult community.
(7) In accordance with Section 706 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, as amended,226 the
provisions of the development plan relating to the use, bulk and
location of buildings and structures, the quantity and location of
common open space and the intensity of use or the density of
residential units shall run in favor of the Township and shall be
enforceable in law or in equity by the Township, without limitation
on any powers or regulation otherwise granted the Township by
law. The development plan shall specify those of its provisions
which shall run in favor of and be enforceable by residents of the
planned active adult community and, in addition, the manner in
which such residents may modify or release such rights.

residential density by type of dwelling of the area which includes stages
already finally approved and the stage for which final approval is being
sought exceeds by more than 10% the gross residential density for each
type of dwelling unit allowed for the entire planned active adult
community in the tentatively approved plan. Where it is necessary to
allocate open space to early stages to avoid exceeding maximum gross
residential densities, the developer may be required to grant an open
space easement or covenant to the Township specifying the amount,
and if necessary, the location of open space.

[Added 6-4-2013 by Ord. No. 348; amended 9-24-2013 by Ord. No.
352247]
§ 210-160.1. Intent; purpose; use regulations.
A. Intent. Pursuant to the power and authority granted by the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act No. 247,248 as
amended, the regulations of the Loop Road Overlay District are
intended to meet the following criteria:
(1) The Loop Road Overlay District shall be deemed an overlay district
on the specific parcels identified on the Zoning Map. The
regulations, requirements and restrictions set forth in this article
shall apply to development in the Loop Road Overlay District and
shall supersede the regulations, requirements and restrictions
applicable to the underlying zoning district.
(2) The purpose of establishing the Loop Road Overlay District shall be
to allow the development of a well-planned, designed, built and
maintained shopping center on a large parcel of ground crossing
municipal boundaries and designed around a new loop road. The
planned shopping centers in the Loop Road Overlay District may
provide for a variety of uses within the same complex. Such centers
shall have all necessary services and facilities comprehensively
provided in accordance with an approved development plan.
Provisions of this district are formulated to achieve harmoniously
designed structures upon a well-designed and well-landscaped site.
(3) The Loop Road Overlay District may be applied to those parcels of
land, as designated by the Township from time to time, that are
zoned LI, Light Industry District.
(4) The Loop Road Overlay District may be applied to those parcels of
land that include in their development plan the completion of the
Wilmington-West Chester Pike and Baltimore Pike Loop Road as
recommended in the Comprehensive Plan Update of Concord
Township dated June 6, 2000.
(5) The Loop Road Overlay District may be employed to mitigate
zoning provision differences with other municipalities when a
parcel of land is situated in two municipalities and different zoning
provisions apply, thus creating a more coordinated, efficient and
well-planned development.
B. Use regulations for the Loop Road Overlay District.

(9) Off-street parking and loading requirements.
(a) For developments in the Loop Road Overlay District, all uses
shall be parked at a minimum of 4.5 spaces for each 1,000
square feet of gross floor area, except as set forth below:
[1] Restaurant uses: 4.5 for each 1,000 square feet of gross
floor area, provided that the gross floor area of all
restaurants in the Loop Road Overlay District does not
exceed 10% of the total gross floor area. If the gross floor
area of all restaurants in the Loop Road Overlay District
exceeds 10% of the total gross floor area, the gross floor
area in excess of 10% shall be parked at 15 spaces for each
1,000 square feet of gross floor area. Because
developments in the Loop Road Overlay District
necessarily provide for shared and overflow parking, an
outdoor seating area shall not be counted as gross floor

Main Street lifestyle centers in excess of 400,000 square feet, all
uses shall be parked at 4.5 spaces for each 1,000 square feet of
gross floor area, except as set forth below:
(a) Retail sales and service uses: 4.5 spaces for each 1,000 square
feet of gross floor area, excluding accessory outdoor retail
areas such as sidewalk displays and kiosks.

ownership or shall be the subject of an application filed jointly by
the owners of the entire tract in which it shall be agreed that the
tract will be developed under single direction in accordance with
an approved master development plan.
(3) Further subdivision of tract. After the Board of Supervisors
approves a final development plan for a lot containing approval for
the construction of more than one building, the subsequent division
of that lot into a separate lot for each building for purposes of
financing and/or conveyancing shall be permitted and is exempted
from additional plan review requirements and/or the lot design
criteria requirements of the Concord Township Code, Chapter 160,
Subdivision and Land Development, provided that the deeds
conveying such separate lots for each building depicted on said
final development plan contain covenants requiring the purchasers
to, at all times, operate and maintain such lots in good order and
repair and in a clean and sanitary condition; that cross-easements
for parking areas and all appurtenant ways, pedestrian access and
utilities shall be maintained between such lots; and that such

the applicant for a Main Street lifestyle center shall provide plans
showing that the tract will be provided with a unified stormwater
management plan. The plan shall show the proposed locations and
general design of stormwater detention basins; however, detailed
stormwater engineering and calculations shall not be required until
subdivision/land development plans are submitted.
N. Traffic. A traffic impact study shall be required and submitted as part of
the conditional use application. The applicant shall provide credible
evidence that the Main Street lifestyle center will include sufficient
road improvements to mitigate the traffic impacts of the development

hazards consistent with the provisions of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.
O. Design guidelines. Applicant shall submit design guidelines for the
Main Street lifestyle center to the Township during the conditional use
hearing, which shall be reviewed and approved by the Township as part
of the conditional use application, if such application is approved. The
design guidelines shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the

(6) Maintain an updated inventory which clearly identifies buildings,
sites, structures, objects and districts and their respective
classifications on the Historic Resources Map.
(7) Consider, promote and, with the approval of the Board of
Supervisors, apply for technical and financial assistance from
appropriate local, county, state, federal and other agencies in the
preservation of significant historical and architectural sites within
the Township and to report all related actions to the Board of
Supervisors.
(8) Prepare and submit a yearly budget to the Board of Supervisors for
sums deemed necessary to carry out the objectives of the

Township Board of Supervisors.
A. No Class I or Class II historic resource, as defined on the Historic
Resources Map, may be demolished unless the property owner obtains
a permit and complies with this section. Demolition includes demolition
by neglect which refers to leaving a building or structure or other
resource open to vandalism or vulnerable to decay by the elements.
Unoccupied structures are required to be tightly sealed and fenced off
and the utilities turned off for safety.
B. Permit requirements. No Class I or Class II historic resource within
Concord Township shall be demolished unless in compliance with the
applicable standards and procedures of the Township building and fire
codes. In particular, the Building Inspector, or such other person or
agency charged by the Board of Supervisors with the issuance of
permits for demolitions, shall not issue a permit for any proposed
demolition that is not in compliance with those requirements and, as
applicable, with the requirements of this section. If such a resource is
determined to be a victim of neglect and the owner fails to rehabilitate
the resource or apply for a demolition permit, the Township may then
determine that the property is being demolished and may request a
demolition permit application from the owner and require the owner to
participate in the permit process.
§ 210-183.5 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-183.6
196:803
C. Proposed demolition of historic resources. All applications to demolish
a Class I or Class II historic resource, as defined on the Historic
Resources Map, that are received by the Township will be forwarded to
the Board of Supervisors for acceptance at its next public meeting. This
meeting will begin the review period, at the end of which, or prior if
appropriate, the Board of Supervisors will render a decision. The
review period begins with the acceptance of the application and ends at
the Board's monthly meeting three calendar months after acceptance of
the application.
D. Following the Board's acceptance of the application, the Historical
Commission shall review the application and may appoint a Project
Manager to work with the property owner on processing the
application.
E. Application requirements for historic resources. In addition to
applicable requirements under the Township building and fire codes,
any property owner seeking a permit to demolish a Class I or Class II
historic resource shall provide a written report of the following with
regard to that historic resource. Some of the information required may
be obtained through the Historical Commission; however, it is the
property owner's responsibility to produce the report.
(1) Owner of record.
(2) Identification, description and classification from the Historic
Resources Map.
(3) Site plan showing all buildings and structures and all historic
resources on the property.
(4) Recent photographs of the resource proposed for demolition.
(5) Reasons for the demolition.
(6) Method of demolition.
(7) Future uses of the site and of the materials from the demolished
resource.
(8) Alternatives to demolition.
F. Review by the Concord Township Historical Commission. After the
property owner has provided the information required and the
Historical Commission has reviewed the findings and discussed
alternatives with the property owner, the Historical Commission will
review the application at its next public meeting. The property owner
shall be notified of the meeting and requested to present evidence or
testimony pertaining to the demolition at the meeting. In reviewing the
application, the Commission shall take into account:
§ 210-183.6 CONCORD CODE § 210-183.6
196:804
(1) The effect of demolition on the historical significance and
architectural integrity of neighboring contributing historic
resources.
(2) Economic feasibility of adaptively reusing the resource proposed
for demolition.
(3) Alternatives to demolition of the resource.
(4) Special incentives to encourage the owner to maintain the
structure, such as including the historic resource as part of the
open space contribution, including it as part of a homeowners'
association or including the resource in the conditional use
provisions under § 210-183.7.
G. Initial recommendation of the Concord Historical Commission. Within
the review period, unless the property owner has agreed, in writing, to
an extension of time, the Commission shall recommend one of the
following courses of action to the Board of Supervisors:
(1) The Commission may recommend that the Board issue a certificate
of appropriateness to the Building Inspector to issue the demolition
permit.
(2) The Commission may elect to request additional time, as specified
in Subsection H below, to provide adequate opportunity for the
Commission to document the resource proposed for demolition,
prior to the actual demolition of the resource. Such documentation
may include photographs, floor plans, measured drawings,
archaeological survey and any other comparable form of
documentation required by the Commission.
(3) The Commission may recommend that the demolition permit be
denied because an economically viable alternative use has been
found for the historic resource. This alternative use may be in
concurrence with the property owner, or may require additional
time as specified in Subsection H below, to resolve the issues
around the alternative use.
H. Time extension. The Commission or the property owner may request an
extension of the review period in order to resolve the issues around the
issuance of the demolition permit as stipulated in Subsection G above.
Each extension shall be mutually agreed upon and shall be for a
specified period of time.
I. Action by Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors, within the
time frame specified herein and after reviewing all available
information, shall take final action upon the application and, where
appropriate, issue a certificate of appropriateness to the Building
Inspector.

196:820
§ 210-186. Identification of floodplain areas.
or relocated, in noncompliance with the article may be declared by the
Supervisors to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
A. Identification. The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of the
Township of Concord which are classified as special flood hazard areas
(SFHA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated November 18, 2009, and
September 2, 2015, or the most recent revision thereof issued by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including all digital
data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study, or the Floodplain
Conservation District Map for Concord Township, dated October 1971,
as revised December 1977, whichever is more restrictive. The abovereferenced
FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments, are hereby adopted by Concord Township and declared to
be a part of this article.
B. Description and special requirements of floodplain areas. The identified
floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
(1) The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and
the FIRM as Floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. The term shall
also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and
FIRM.
(a) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless a permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
(2) The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
(a) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
§ 210-185 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-186
196:821
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(3) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base elevation shall be determined
by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified
floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu of the
above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the
elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications,
who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses,
computation, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the Township.
(4) The Floodplain Conservation District Map for Concord Township,
dated October 1971, as revised December 1977 identifies local
flood hazard or ponding areas using best available topographic
data and locally derived information such as flood of record,
historic high water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.
C. Changes in identification of area. The identified floodplain area may be
revised or modified by the Board, where studies or information
provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such
revision. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after
the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify
FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting
technical or scientific data. See § 210-187 for situations where FEMA
notification is required.
D. Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
Township, and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
E. Jurisdictional boundary changes. Prior to development occurring in
areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard
data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The community
shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those
in 44 CFR 60.3.
§ 210-186 CONCORD CODE § 210-187
196:822
§ 210-187. Technical provisions.
A. General.
(1) No encroachment, alteration or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality and until all required permits or approvals have been
first obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office. No encroachment, alteration, or
improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse unless
it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the
flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way. In addition,
FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or
relocation of any watercourse.
(2) Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed
within any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the provisions contained in this article and any
other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
(3) When a community proposes to permit the following
encroachments: any development that causes a rise in the base
flood elevations within the floodway; any development occurring in
Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of
more than one foot in the base flood elevation; alteration or
relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing
culverts and bridges); the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part
65.12):
(a) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(b) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of
map change and prior to approving the proposed
encroachments, a community shall provide evidence to FEMA
of the adoption of floodplain management ordinances
incorporating the increased base flood elevations and/or
revised floodway reflecting the post-project condition.
(c) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final
map revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance
with 44 CFR Part 67.
(4) Within any identified floodplain area, no new construction or
development shall be located within the area measured 50 feet
landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless a permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.

applicant's antenna support structure at a greater height than is
required by the applicant.
D. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed antenna and
antenna support structure are safe and the surrounding properties will
not be negatively affected by antenna support structure failure, falling
ice or other debris. All antenna support structures shall be fitted with
anti-climbing devices, as approved by the manufacturers and the
Township.
E. In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in
the Township in the future, the proposed antenna support structure
shall be required to accommodate, where possible, other users,
including other wireless communication, cellular communication and
personal communication service provider companies, and local police,
fire and ambulance companies. Applicants shall provide evidence that
all other authorized users have been contacted by the applicant with an
offer of collocation on the applicant's proposed antenna support
structure.

A. The Zoning Officer shall be appointed by the Concord Township Board
of Supervisors and is authorized to process applications for sign
permits and enforce and carry out all provisions of the Sign Ordinance
both in letter and in spirit. The Zoning Officer is empowered, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter or inspect any building,
structure or premises in the Township for the purpose of inspection of a
sign and its structural and electrical connections to ensure compliance
with all applicable codes and ordinances. Such inspections shall be
carried out during business hours unless an emergency exists.
B. Application for permits. Application for a sign permit for the erection,
alteration or relocation of a sign shall be made to the Zoning Officer
upon a form provided by the Zoning Officer and shall include the
following information:
(1) Name and address of the owner of the sign.
(2) Street address or location of the property on which the sign is to be
located, along with the name and address of the property owner.

established by resolution of the Concord Township Board of Supervisors
from time to time.
D. Issuance and denial. If a sign complies with this article, the Zoning
Officer shall issue a permit for the erection, alteration or relocation of
the sign within 30 days of receipt of a valid application. In all
applications involving a matter of interpretation, the more specific

misrepresentation of fact in the application.
E. Permit conditions, refunds and penalties. If a permit is denied, the
permit fee will be refunded to the applicant. A permit issued by the
Zoning Officer becomes null and void if work is not commenced within
60 days of issuance or if the sign is not completed within 180 days of
permit issuance. If any sign is installed or placed on any property prior
to the receipt of a permit, the specified permit fee shall be doubled.
However, payment of the doubled fee shall not relieve any person from
complying with any other requirement or penalty prescribed in this
article.

exists, the Zoning Officer shall issue a written order to the alleged
violator. The order shall specify those sections of this article of
which the individual may be in violation and shall state that the
individual has 10 days from the date of the order in which to
correct the alleged violation.
(2) If, upon inspection, the Zoning Officer finds that a sign is
abandoned or structurally, materially or electrically defective or in
any way endangers the public, the Zoning Officer shall issue a
written order to the owner of the sign and occupant of the premises
stating the nature of the violation and require the owner and
occupant to repair or remove the sign within three days of the date
of the order.
(3) In cases of emergency the Zoning Officer may, without notice,
cause the immediate removal of a dangerous or defective sign.
Signs removed in this manner must present a hazard to the public
health, welfare and safety.

appropriate state and federal regulations. Should this article be in conflict
with any state and federal regulations, the more stringent regulations shall
apply.
§ 210-216. Liability for damages.
Provisions of this article shall not be construed to relieve or to limit in any
way the responsibility or liability of any person, firm or corporation who or
which erects or owns a sign for personal injury or property damage caused
by the sign, and the provisions of this article shall not be construed to
impose upon the Township, its officers or its employees any responsibility
or liability by reason of the approval of any sign under the provisions of this
article.
shall be mailed to the sign owner stating the nature of the work and
the date on which it was performed and demanding payment of the
costs as certified by the Zoning Officer.
(2) If the amount specified in the notice is not paid within 30 days of
the notice, it shall become an assessment upon a lien against the
property of the sign owner and will be certified as an assessment
against the property. The owner of the property upon which the
sign is located shall be presumed to be the owner of the sign
thereon unless facts to the contrary are brought to the attention of
the Zoning Officer, as in the case of a leased sign.
I. Appeal of Zoning Officer sign permit application denial. An applicant
whose application for a sign permit has been denied by the Zoning
Officer may submit to the Concord Township Zoning Hearing Board an
appeal and/or a petition for variance. The appeal or petition must be
filed with the Township not later than 30 days after the notice of denial.

Nonconforming Uses, Buildings, Lots
§ 210-226. Purpose.
§ 210-227. Continuation of lawful nonconforming condition or use.
§ 210-228. Extension or alteration.
A. Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that
may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, uses of land and
structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this
chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future
amendment.
B. The regulations governing existing nonconforming uses are set forth in
this article and are intended to provide a gradual remedy for the
incompatibilities resulting from such nonconforming uses. While such
uses are generally permitted to continue, these regulations are
designed to restrict further investment in such uses, thereby keeping
them from becoming more permanent establishments in inappropriate
locations.
C. These regulations are thus designed to preserve the character of the
districts established in this Zoning Code in the light of their peculiar
suitability to particular uses, and thus to promote and protect health,
safety and general welfare.
A. Any lawful nonconforming condition or use of a building or lot existing
at the effective date of this chapter (i.e., December 7, 1982) or any
subsequent amendment hereto or authorized by a building permit
issued prior to the adoption of this chapter (i.e., December 7, 1982),
may be continued, although such condition or use does not conform to
the provisions of this chapter, if all other requirements governing the
condition or use are complied with, and subject to the provisions of
§ 210-230 of the Zoning Ordinance. [Amended 6-4-1991 by Ord. No.
181]
B. Any lawful nonconforming condition or use of a building or lot existing
at the effective date of this chapter or any subsequent amendment
hereto or authorized by a building permit issued prior to the adoption of
this chapter may be continued, although such condition of use does not
conform to the provisions of this chapter, if all other requirements
governing the condition or use are complied with.
A. Nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use of a building or lot may be
extended or enlarged either within an existing building or by an
addition to it on the same lot, provided that:
(1) Such extension shall be permitted only by special exception.
§ 210-226 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-228
196:887
(2) The extension conforms to all district regulations for buildings and
lots.
(3) The part of the building into which the use is to be extended has
been manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time such
use became nonconforming.
(4) The part of the lot into which the use is to be extended was
reasonably held for future inclusion in such use at the time such
use became nonconforming.
B. Nonconforming lots.
(1) A building may be erected or extended on any lot or contiguous lots
held at the effective date of this chapter or any amendment thereto
in single and separate ownership, which lot is not of the required
minimum area or width or is of such unusual dimensions that the
owner would have difficulty in providing the required open spaces
for the district in which such lot is situated, provided that the
building shall comply with the front, side and rear yard
requirements of the district in which such lot is situated, unless
otherwise authorized as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing
Board, and in any case where Zoning Hearing Board review is
required, the building shall comply with the yard requirements of
the district to the maximum extent practicable.
(2) When two or more nonconforming lots with contiguous frontage
are in single ownership, the Zoning Officer shall consider them a
single piece of land, and use of it, or any portion of it, shall be in
accordance with the Zoning Ordinance then in existence.
C. Nonconforming buildings.
(1) If use is conforming:
(a) Nonconforming structures may be altered, reconstructed or
enlarged, provided that such alteration, reconstruction or
enlargement does not increase the extent of the nonconformity
existing on the effective date of this chapter.
(b) If a nonconforming structure is moved wholly or partially
within or off of the lot, the part moved must conform to the
regulations of the district where it is moved.
(2) If use is nonconforming:
(a) The extension or alteration in the structure must meet the
requirement for the extension or alteration of a nonconforming
use, as given in Subsection A(1), (2), (3) and (4). [Amended

the height, area and volume of the building destroyed. If the use is
conforming, the reconstructed building may be built to any height,
area or volume, provided that Township ordinances and codes are
observed.
A. If a nonconforming lot or building is abandoned and not used for a
continuous period of one year or more, subsequent use of such lot or
building shall be in conformity with the then provisions of this chapter
governing the district in which the lot or building is located.
B. Abandonment of regulations shall not apply to agricultural uses.
C. All nonconforming junk storage areas, storage areas and similar
nonconforming use of open land, when discontinued for a period of 90

construction or designated use of a structure for which a building permit
was issued more than 30 days prior to the adoption of this chapter or
change in zoning district and the construction of which is begun within
three months after such adoption of change and diligently carried on.
The approved plans shall not be altered in any way to increase the
nonconformity.
§ 210-233. Violations. [Amended 3-5-1991 by Ord. No. 177]
A nonconforming building altered or erected or a nonconforming use
created in violation of any previous provision shall be regarded as
continuing in such violation and shall not enjoy the privilege of legal
continuance conferred by this article upon other nonconforming buildings
and uses.

No. 177]
§ 210-235. District changes. [Amended 3-5-1991 by Ord. No. 177]
Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer
an area from one district to another district of a different classification,
the foregoing provisions shall also apply to any nonconforming uses or
structures existing therein.
A. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive
months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of nonbearing
walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 10% of
the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or
nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided
that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not
be increased.
B. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack
of repairs and maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized
official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall
not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
C. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to
be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon
order of such official.

conditional uses, as authorized by Act of 1968, P.L. 804, No. 247, as
reenacted and amended (the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, § 603 (C)(2) and (2.1) and § 913.2. The provisions consist of:
(1) The standards and criteria to be applied to the various conditional
uses in the review process.
(2) The procedure to be followed for review of the application.
B. The reason for a use being made conditional is the unusual impact it
may exert upon one or more of the following: the public health, safety,
morals, general welfare, coordinated and practical community
development, proper density of population, emergency management
preparedness and operations, airports and national defense facilities,
the provisions of adequate light and air, access to incident solar energy,
police protection, vehicle parking and loading space, transportation,
sewerage, schools, recreational facilities, public grounds, the provision
of a safe, reliable and adequate water supply for domestic, commercial,
agricultural or industrial use and other public requirements.
C. In addition, the purpose of the use being made conditional is to prevent
one or more of the following: overcrowding of land, blight, danger and
congestion in travel and transportation, loss of life, health or property
from fire, flood, panic or other dangers.
D. In addition, the purpose of the use being made conditional is to
preserve the natural, scenic and historic value in the environment and
preserve forests, wetlands, acquifers and floodplains.
A. If, in reviewing an application for development, the Zoning Officer rules
that the processing of the application requires approval of a conditional
use, the Zoning Officer shall refer the application to the Board of
Supervisors and shall send copies to the Township Planning
Commission for review. The application shall be in such form and with
such supporting data as the Board of Supervisors may prescribe. The
appropriate application fee, prescribed by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors from time to time, shall be paid in advance.
B. Upon receipt of complete application and fees for conditional use, the
Planning Commission shall schedule it for preliminary consideration
and discussion at a regular or special meeting. The Planning
Commission shall advise the Board of Supervisors whether the general
§ 210-236 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-237
196:891
and specific standards and criteria are met and whether conditions and/
or restrictions should be attached to any approvals.
C. The Planning Commission shall be authorized to require of the
applicant such further engineering data, test reports, maps, surveys,
plot plans, landscape plans, technical information, offers of dedication,
bonds and other undertakings as may be necessary to determine and
ensure compliance with the standards and criteria hereinbefore and
hereinafter set forth.
D. If the application involves a land development, a detailed plan review
shall be required by the Township after the application of the
conditional use has been acted upon by the Board of Supervisors. This
review shall be in accordance with procedures outlined in the
Subdivision and land Development Ordinance. If the applicant wishes to
provide the necessary documentation, the Township may consider the
concurrent review of the conditional use requested and the detailed
plans for the development. Time limits for review of the detailed plans,
if necessary, will be governed by Chapter 160, Subdivision and land
Development provisions of the Township Code.
E. No conditional use shall be approved by the Board of Supervisors
unless, or except to the extent that, the general and specific standards
and criteria are met and appropriate conditions and restrictions are
attached to the approval to ensure continuing compliance therewith.
The general standards and criteria are set forth below.
(1) Taking into consideration the character and type of development in
the area surrounding the proposed conditional use, such use, as
permitted, shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and
shall not substantially injure or detract from the use of surrounding
property or from the character of the neighborhood.
(2) Existing public roads shall be adequate to serve additional traffic
reasonably likely to be generated by the proposed use.
(3) Development of the property for the proposed use shall promote or
be consistent with the coordinated and practical community
development, the provision of adequate public and community
services, the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
(4) If the proposed site would be created by subdivision of a larger
tract or parcel, the balance of such tract or parcel remaining shall
be adequate and appropriate for its existing and continuing use in
accordance with the foregoing standards.
(5) Development of the property for the proposed use shall, if
approved, be subject to and governed by the provisions of the
Concord Township Code, Subdivision and Land Development, as
amended,274 except as modified by this article and by the
274. Editor's Note: See Ch. 160, Subdivision and Land Development.

requirements of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department
of Environmental Protection.
(6) Development of the site for the proposed use shall be susceptible of
regulation by appropriate conditions and restrictions to:
(a) Ensure compatibility of any building to be erected or altered
with the surrounding area in terms of size, shape, materials
and placement of structures; and preservation and restoration
of any historic buildings.
(b) Control traffic, noise, signs, lights, parking and other
anticipated activity upon the premises to avoid or minimize any
adverse effect upon the peace, quiet, privacy and the character
of the surrounding area.
(c) Require such additional landscaping pursuant to an approved
landscape plan for protective buffering and screening of
adjoining residential or other permitted uses, as specified in
Article XXI, § 210-193.

agreements to impose upon the property such deed
restrictions as are, in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors,
necessary and reasonable to assure the continuation of
conditions imposed upon approval of the development.
(e) Require that the applicant make provision for the safe flow of
anticipated normal daily traffic in the immediate vicinity of the
development and and provide more than one means of ingress
and egress and adequate deceleration lanes.
(f) Permit staged development and set deadlines for such
development and staging and conditions for the proper
maintenance of that portion of the property not being
developed.
F. The Board of Supervisors shall conduct a full review of the application
and shall hold at least one public hearing thereon not later than 60 days
from the date of the applicant's request for a hearing. The cost of such
public hearings shall be borne by the applicant. Notice of the public
hearing shall be given to those persons and agencies who would be
entitled to notice if the same premises were the subject of an
application to the Zoning Hearing Board for special exception and to all
others who have registered their names with the Zoning Officer for that
purpose.
G. After a full review of the application, the Board of Supervisors shall
renter a written decision, or when no decision is called for, make
written findings on the application. Where the application is contested
or denied, the decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact or
conclusions based thereon, together with any reasons therefor. Such

the development.
K. Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of approval, the applicant
shall be entitled to proceed with the submission of either land
development or subdivision plans within a period of six months from the
date of approval. The Board, as a condition of approval, may require the
applicant to proceed with the submission of either land development or
subdivision plans within a period of six months of the date of approval.
A. The Township shall approve any conditional use proposed if it finds that
the use meets all the applicable objectives and requirements indicated

better conserve or preserve critical environmental and cultural
resources.
(2) Where development of less than the entire tract is intended, or
where the tract is intended to be developed at less density than

historical significance to the Township or possessing unique
value and deserving of being preserved due to age,
architectural significance or association in the perception of
the public with a prominent person or family of the state,
county or Township. An inventory of such existing structures is
set forth in the Delaware County Historic Survey of June 1983

homestay facility, shall be occupied and used solely
by the residential occupant and members of his/her family.
(2) Standards of facility.
(a) No more than three guest rooms may be located in or used for
guests in any facility.
§ 210-238 CONCORD CODE § 210-238
196:896
(b) Each facility shall have at least two bathroom facilities for the
exclusive use of the guests, provided that a facility containing
only one guest room need only provide one bathroom facility.
The bathroom facility shall contain a toilet, wash basin and a
bath and/or shower, as certified and permitted by the Township
Plumbing Inspector.
(c) Each facility shall be serviced by an adequate sewage system
for both the main use and the accessory use, as certified and

(d) Each facility shall provide on the premises a minimum of one
off-street parking space for each guest room, and one for each
employee on the shift having the greatest employment, in
addition to adequate and separate parking facilities for the

applicable ordinances of the Township and any conditions imposed
upon the grant of the conditional use. Each application for a permit
or a renewal permit shall be accompanied by a permit fee in an
amount as determined from time to time by the Township.
E. Adult entertainment uses. [Added 11-7-1995 by Ord. No. 200]
(1) Objectives.
(a) Because adult entertainment uses tend to bring with them
secondary concerns that impact on the health, safety and
general welfare concerns of Concord Township, the Township
desires to restrict or limit the location where such uses can
locate.
(b) The Township does not intend to affect or suppress any
activities protected by the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution, but instead address these secondary
effects. Neither is it the intent nor effect of these provisions to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
Neither is it the intent to permit any use which is prohibited by
the provisions of Ordinance No. 198 and Ordinance No. 199.275
(c) Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in
reports made available to the Board of Supervisors, and on
findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Northend Cinema, Inc. v.
Seattle, 585 P.2d 1153 (Wash. 1978), and on studies in other
communities, including but not limited to Phoenix, Arizona;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Manatee
County, Florida; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle,
Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Beaumont, Texas,
and also on findings found in the Report of Attorney General's
Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Board of
Supervisors finds that:
[1] Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that may go uncontrolled
by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is
presently no mechanism to make the owners of these
establishments responsible for the activities that occur on
their premises.
275. Editor's Note: See Ch. 70, Article I, Display, Sale and Distribution of Obscene Materials,
and Article II, Establishments Serving Alcoholic Beverages, respectively.
§ 210-238 CONCORD CODE § 210-238
196:898
[2] Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined
in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in
higher incidence of certain types of sexually oriented
behavior at these businesses than employees of other
establishments.
[3] Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex,
occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those
which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for
viewing films, videos or live sex shows, as defined under
this chapter as adult bookstores, adult novelty shops, adult
video stores, adult motion-picture theaters or adult
arcades.
[4] Offering and providing such space encourages such
activities, which create unhealthy conditions.
[5] Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and
other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of
engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually
oriented businesses.
[6] At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses,
including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human
immunodeficiency virus infection (AIDS), genital herpes,
hepatitis B, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections.
[7] Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an
increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS
caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the
United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984,
8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
[8] As of May 1, 1995, there have been 13,559 reported cases
of AIDS in the State of Pennsylvania.
[9] Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an
increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive
for the HIV antibody test in Delaware County,
Pennsylvania.
[10] The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis
in the United States reported annually has risen, with
33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through
November of 1990.
[11] The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States
reported annually remains at a high level, with over onehalf
million cases being reported in 1990.
§ 210-238 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-238
196:899
[12] The surgeon general of the United States, in his report of
October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that
AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual
contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected
blood and blood components and from an infected mother
to her newborn.
[13] According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally
transmitted by sexual acts.
[14] Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses
are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted
there are unhealthy and, in part, because of the
unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the
owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate
those activities and maintain those facilities.
[15] Numerous studies and reports have determined that
semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses
where persons view adult oriented films.
[16] The findings noted in Subsection E(1)(c)[1] through [15]
raise substantial governmental concerns.
(d) The purpose of these conditional use provisions is to minimize,
where conditions permit, the secondary concerns which
include difficulties for law enforcement, municipal
maintenance, trash, deleterious effects on business and
residential property values, increased crime, particularly
corruption of the morals of minors and prostitution, and
encouraging residents and businesses to move elsewhere.
(2) Yard and area regulations.
(a) In addition to the yard and area regulations applicable to all
uses permitted pursuant to the provisions of Article XVII, no
adult entertainment use shall be located:
[1] Within 1,000 feet of:
[a] A church, synagogue, mosque, temple or building
which is used primarily for religious worship and
related religious activities;
[b] A public or private educational facility, including but
not limited to child day-care facilities, nursery schools,
preschools, kindergartens, elementary schools,
private schools, intermediate schools, junior high
schools, middle schools, high schools, vocational
schools, secondary schools, continuation schools,
special education schools, junior colleges and
§ 210-238 CONCORD CODE § 210-238
196:900

does not include the facilities used primarily for
another purpose and only incidentally as a school;
[c] A licensed premises, licensed pursuant to the
alcoholic beverage control regulations of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania;
[d] Any other adult entertainment use;
[2] Or within 800 feet of a boundary of a residential district as

[3] Or within 500 feet of:
[a] A public park or recreational area which has been
designated for park or recreational activities,
including but not limited to a park, playground, nature
trails, swimming pool, reservoir, athletic field,
basketball or tennis courts, pedestrian/bicycle paths,
wilderness areas, or other similar public land within
the Township which is is under the control, operation
or management of the Township park and recreation
authorities, or other similar land within the Township
which is under the control, operation or management
of private parties and open and available for use by
the general public;
[b] An entertainment business which is oriented primarily
towards children and family entertainment;
[4] Or within 400 feet of the right-of-way line of U.S. Route 1
(Baltimore Pike), Wilmington-West Chester Pike (Route
202) or Pennsylvania highway Route 322 (Conchester
Highway).
(b) For the purpose of Subsection E(2)(a), Yard and area
regulations, of this section, measurement shall be made in a
straight line, without regard to the intervening structures or
objects, from the nearest portion of the building or structure
used as the part of the premises where a sexually oriented
business is conducted to the nearest property line of the
premises of a use listed in Subsection E(2)(a). Presence of a
municipal, county or other political subdivision boundary shall
be irrelevant for purposes of calculating and applying the
distance requirements of this Subsection E(2).
(3) Screening and buffering. Any lot which is to be used for any adult
entertainment use shall contain screening and buffering along
property lines adjoining other zoning districts in accordance with
the provisions of Article XXI, Landscaping.
§ 210-238 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-238
196:901
(4) Data. Sufficient additional data shall be submitted to enable the
Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors to determine
that the requirements of this chapter and other ordinances of the
Township relevant to the proposed use have been fulfilled and that
the owners and operators of proposed adult entertainment facilities
demonstrate a desire and ability to comply with the ordinances of
the Township and to prevent their establishments from being used
for any illegal activities.
F. Personal care facility. [Added 3-4-1997 by Ord. No. 210]
(1) Objectives: to set forth the criteria for the use of a property as a

196:903
buildings sited as compactly as is reasonably feasible and in
a manner intended to duplicate the appearance and feel of a
small, integrated community or village. The physical design of

the side or rear of the buildings, shall be adequate in size, shall
be so arranged that they may be used without blockage or
interference with the use of the accessways or parking
facilities, shall be located as far as possible from the residential
areas of the personal care facility and shall be constructed so
as to be as unobtrusive as possible and screened from abutting
properties through landscaping, berming, fencing or other
appropriate measures. There shall additionally be at least one
entrance to which there is unobstructed access in accordance
with the provisions of Article XXIV, § 210-220, of the Zoning

number of spaces calculated under the formula set forth
above need be constructed at the time that occupancy of
the personal care facility first begins. The construction
of the remaining 25% of the total number of spaces
calculated under the formula set forth above may be
required at any later time at the sole discretion of the
Supervisors of Concord Township, upon a finding that the
parking required for the facility requires the extra spaces.
[2] Off-street parking for residents, employees and visitors
shall be placed in the rear or on the side of the facility and
shall be made as unobtrusive as possible through the use
of berming and landscaping that complies with Article

I. Transfer of development rights. [Added 5-1-2007 by Ord. No. 311]
(1) Purpose. The primary purpose of transfer of development rights
(TDR) is to permanently preserve features such as prime farmland,
critical environmental areas, and open space that would be lost if
land were to be developed. In addition, this section is intended to
protect property rights by allowing landowners whose land is
proposed for preservation to transfer their right to develop to other
areas of the Township deemed appropriate for higher intensity
development based on the availability of infrastructure (public
water, public sewer, better roads). It is the particular intention of
this section that the transfer of development rights be utilized to
preserve and conserve the resources such as, but not limited to:
(a) Prime farmland soils and agricultural land.
(b) Woodland and forest resources.
(c) Stream valleys.
(d) Historic resources and places having unique historical,
architectural or patriotic interest or value (in accordance with
Section 605(2)(vi) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code279).
(2) Concept.
(a) The provisions of this section which permit transfer of
development rights allow landowners in areas of Concord
Township proposed for preservation and conservation, called
"sending areas," to sell the right to develop all, or a portion of
their land to landowners in areas of Concord Township
proposed for additional development, called "receiving areas."
The Transfer of Development Rights provisions set forth below
are specifically authorized under Section 603(c)(2.2) and 619.1
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,280 under the
279. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10605(2)(vi).
280. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10603(c)(2.2) and 10619.1.
§ 210-238 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-238
196:907
terms of which development rights are acknowledged to be
severable and separately conveyable from a sending area to a
receiving area.
(b) The sending areas shall be from the R-1, R-2, R-2D, or R-3
Districts, as limited by the sending area qualifications below.
(c) The receiving areas shall apply to the C-1 District portion of
the Concordville Village Overlay District, and as further limited
by the receiving area qualifications below.
(d) When landowners in a sending area sell their right to develop
all, or a portion of their land, they must create a restrictive
covenant or a conservation easement against any future
development on that portion of land from which development
rights are sold. However, the land may still be used for
purposes that do not involve development, such as agriculture
or forestry. When landowners in a receiving area buy the
development rights from landowners in a sending area, they
receive the right to build at a greater intensity or density on
their land than would otherwise be permitted if they had not
purchased development rights.
(e) Restrictive covenants or conservation easements imposed in a
sending area will not affect the landowner's ability to sell the
property after the development rights have been sold, although
such land cannot ever be used for development purposes. The
restrictive covenant or conservation easement on the land from
which the development rights have been sold shall run in favor
of the Township or an approved conservation organization.
(f) The owner of the tract in a sending area from which the
development rights are sold or any subsequent purchaser or
purchasers of the development rights may declare the
development rights for sale, may hold the development rights
or may resell the development rights. The only use which may
be made of the development rights is the ultimate transfer to a
developer with a tract in a receiving area. The Township shall
have no obligation to purchase the development rights which
have been sold from a tract in a sending area.
(3) Sending area qualifications and calculations. Owners of tracts
which meet the following requirements may sell their development
rights:
(a) Sending area qualifications.
[1] A sending area tract of land shall be located within the R-1,
R-2, R-2D, or R-3 Districts. The tract shall have a minimum
land area of 10 gross acres, and shall contain at least one
of the following resource features, such as, but not limited
to:
§ 210-238 CONCORD CODE § 210-238
196:908
[a] Prime farmland soils or agricultural land.
[b] Woodland and forest resources.
[c] Stream valleys.
[d] Historic resources and places having unique
historical, architectural or patriotic interest or value.
[2] By the time of sale of development rights from a sending
area tract, a minimum area of a sending area tract shall be
restricted from future development in accordance with
Subsection I(3)(c) and (d).
[3] The land within the sending area tract to be restricted
shall be contiguous, and shall be of a regular configuration
not less than 150 feet in width at the narrowest
dimensions, except where infeasible due to the preexisting
configuration of the tract.
[4] The portion of the sending area tract which will not be
restricted shall be usable for the exercise of the retained
development right(s) under the use, area, dimensional,
performance, and other applicable standards of the Zoning
Ordinance and the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.281
(b) Calculation of transfer of development rights.
[1] The total number of development rights which may be sold
shall be based upon the maximum number of single-family
detached dwellings which are permitted to be developed
on the net transferable area of a sending area tract under
the zoning regulations for the R-1, R-2, R-2D, or R-3
Districts.
[2] Net transferable area shall be measured in acres and shall
be determined by subtracting the following from the gross
tract acreage:
[a] The features excluded under the "lot area" definition.
[b] The number of existing dwelling units on the tract
multiplied by the minimum lot area required under the
R-1, R-2, R-2D, or R-3 District regulations.
[c] Land used for nonresidential purposes unless used for
agriculture, public parkland or similar use. The
amount of land subtracted for each nonresidential use
shall be at least as large as the minimum lot area
required under the R-1, R-2, or R-2D District
281. Editor's Note: See Ch. 160, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 210-238 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-238
196:909
regulations and shall be large enough to fully contain
the use and all required yard setbacks for such use.
[d] Development rights previously sold or land previously
restricted from development by restrictive covenant,
or conservation easement, shall be subtracted from
any application of transfer of development rights to
the extent of the restriction(s) in force unless and until
such time as said restrictive covenant or conservation
easement is dissolved or rescinded with agreement of
all beneficiaries of such restrictive covenant or
conservation easement.
[3] The landowner shall produce calculations to indicate:
[a] The gross tract acreage of the sending area tract of
land.
[b] The acreages of the items set forth in Subsection
I(3)(b)[2] (re: calculation of net transferable area).
[4] The net transferable area, in square feet, shall then be
divided by the minimum required lot area for single-family
detached dwellings in the R-1, R-2, R-2D, or R-3 Districts
to produce the maximum number of dwellings permitted
on the tract and the maximum number of transfer of
development rights available on the sending area tract. (If
a fractional number results, then it should be rounded
down.)
[5] The maximum number of transfer of development rights
based on the number of lots or dwelling units feasible
under the base zoning district regulations shall be subject
to review by the Township to confirm that the indicated
number of lots is feasible in accordance with the
ordinances of Concord Township, and based on the
Township's geographic information system (GIS) mapping.
However, the Township reserves the right to request that
the landowner provide plans to determine development
feasibility if the analysis of GIS mapping needs to be
supplemented as determined by the Township Engineer.
(c) Sale of transfer of development rights.
[1] Transfer of development rights which have been severed
shall be conveyed by a deed of transferable development
rights duly recorded in the Office of the Delaware County
Recorder of Deeds. The deed of transferable development
rights shall specify the tract or tracts of land within
eligible receiving area(s) to which the rights shall be
permanently attached or that the rights shall be
§ 210-238 CONCORD CODE § 210-238
196:910
transferred to the Township, retained by the owner of the
sending area tract, or another person in gross.
[2] The deed of transferable development rights which
pertains to the sale of development rights from the
sending area tract(s) shall be accompanied by restrictive
covenants or conservation easements suitable in form and
substance to the Township Solicitor, which shall
permanently restrict future development of the sending
area tract(s) as provided in Subsection I(3)(d), and which
shall be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds at
the time of, or prior to, the deed of transferable
development rights.
[3] All deeds of transferable development rights and
restrictive covenants or conservation easements shall be
endorsed by the Township prior to recording, which
endorsement shall not be unreasonably withheld. Deeds
submitted to the Township for endorsement shall be
accompanied by a title search of the sending area tract(s)
and a legal opinion of title affirming that the development
rights being transferred by the deed have not been
previously sold from, or prohibited upon, the sending area
tract. A title report should be prepared within 10 days
prior to submission of the deed, and the legal opinion of
title must meet the reasonable approval of the Township
Solicitor.
[4] The deeds and covenants or conservation easements shall
be accompanied by a map or plan of the sending area
tract, drawn to a scale of at least one inch equals 100 feet.
Such plan shall:
[a] Include a notation of the number of development
rights retained; and
[b] Graphically represent the geographic extent and
applicability of the conservation restrictions as well as
the general future location(s) available for the use of
any retained development rights.
[5] If less than all of the development rights eligible for
transfer hereunder are to be transferred, the applicant
shall indicate in the deed the disposition of the remaining
development rights.
(d) Sending area restrictive covenant or conservation easement.
Except for retained development rights (not to be transferred),
if any, a sending area tract shall be permanently restricted
from future residential, commercial, or other nonagricultural
development by a restrictive covenant or other conservation
easement which meets the following requirements:
§ 210-238 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-238
196:911
[1] Except where any retained development rights are
specified, the restrictive covenant or conservation
easement shall permanently restrict the land from future
development of any nonagricultural uses, except for public
parkland, conservation areas, and similar uses.
[2] The restrictive covenant or conservation easement shall be
approved by the Board of Supervisors, in consultation with
the Township Solicitor. Final plan approval will be
contingent upon the recording of the deed of transfer of
development rights, and the restrictive covenant or
conservation easement, at the Office of the Recorder of
Deeds of Delaware County.
[3] The restrictive covenant or conservation easement shall
designate Concord Township, and/or a bona fide
conservation organization acceptable to the Township at
its sole discretion, as the beneficiary/grantee, and may, if
the Township so elects, also designate both all future
owners of all or a portion of a sending parcel, and all
future owners of any portion of a receiving area parcel as
having separate and independent enforcement rights with
respect to the restrictive covenants or conservation
easements.
[4] The restrictive covenant or conservation easement shall
apply to a sending area tract of land from which
development rights are sold, and shall specify the number
of development rights to be transferred as well as any to
be retained based on the net transferable area of the tract.
No portion of the net transferable area to be transferred
shall be used to satisfy minimum yard setbacks or lot area
requirements for any development rights which are to be
retained, or for any other development.
(4) Receiving area qualifications and calculations. Owners of tracts
which meet the following requirements may use development
rights that are purchased from sending area landowners:
(a) Receiving area qualifications. The receiving area tract of land
shall be located in the portion of the C-1 District within the
Concordville Village Overlay District. The receiving area tract
shall possess all of the following attributes:
[1] A minimum land area of five gross acres.
[2] A public water system.
[3] A public sanitary sewerage system.
(b) Calculation of potential development at receiving area sites.
§ 210-238 CONCORD CODE § 210-238
196:912
[1] For each development right purchased and transferred
from the R-1, R-2, R-2D, or R-3 Districts sending area,
landowners in the C-1 Commercial District portion of the
Concordville Village Overlay District receiving area shall
have the right to build as a conditional use, five apartment
units in a live-work unit, subject to § 210-125.1D(4)(b) and
F.
(5) Plan submittal process. An applicant shall submit a preliminary
plan showing development with purchase of development rights.
This plan shall meet all requirements of the Concord Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.282 Along with the
preliminary plan, an applicant shall submit:
(a) An agreement of sale for all development rights proposed to be
purchased from the sending area site.
(b) A note on the plan showing the total number of lots or dwelling
units proposed on the receiving area site in the Concordville
Village Overlay District.
(c) A note on the plan showing the total number of lots or dwelling
units that could be built in the Concordville Village Overlay
District when development rights are purchased, the number
of lots or dwelling units that can be built under base density,
and the difference between the two. This difference represents
the number of additional lots or dwelling units that could be
constructed on the site.
(d) A plan of the sending area site(s) from which the applicant
proposes to purchase development rights. This plan shall show
all information needed to determine the number of
development rights which may be sold, as shown in Subsection
I(3). In addition, the plan shall be accompanied by a metes and
bounds description of the property(s), as well as each
property's parcel number, and owner name. If the applicant is
purchasing development rights from a portion of a sending
area site, this portion shall be shown on the plan and described
with metes and bounds.
(e) In order to receive final plan approval, the applicant shall
agree to record restrictive covenants or conservation
easements for all sending area land whose development rights
are being used by the applicant. The restrictive covenant or
conservation easement on the sending area land shall be
recorded first, followed by a deed of transfer, in accordance
with the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended, which transfers the development rights
from a sending area landowner to a receiving area landowner.

283. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 210-239 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-242
196:915
the person who administers the Concord Township Zoning Ordinance
had failed to follow prescribed procedures or had misinterpreted or
misapplied any provision of a valid ordinance or map or any valid rule
or regulation governing the action of the Zoning Officer or the person
who administers the Concord Township Zoning Ordinance.
B. Challenge to the validity of any ordinance or map. The Board shall hear
challenges to the validity of this chapter or to the Zoning Map which
properly comes before the Board in accordance with the code and shall
take evidence, decide contested questions, make findings on all
relevant issues of fact and make a record thereof, as prescribed by said
code and by this chapter.
C. Variances.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant.
(2) A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by
the Board unless and until a written application for a variance is
submitted by the applicant who shall have the burden of
establishing that:
(a) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(b) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and
that the authorization of the variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property.
(c) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
§ 210-242 CONCORD CODE § 210-242
196:916
(3) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of the Municipalities Planning Code284 and the zoning
ordinance of Concord Township.
D. Special exceptions.
(1) Where the Board of Supervisors in the Zoning Ordinance has stated
special exceptions to be granted or denied by the Board pursuant to
express standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide
requests for such special exceptions in accordance with such
standards and criteria. In granting a special exception, the Board
may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition
to those expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and the
Municipalities Planning Code.285
(2) An applicant for a special exception shall have the burden of
establishing both:
(a) That his application falls within the provision of this chapter
which accords to the applicant the right to seek a special
exception; and
(b) That allowance of the special exception will not be contrary to
the standards of law.
(3) In determining whether the allowance of a special exception or a
variance is contrary to the standards of law, the Board shall
consider whether the application, if granted, will:
(a) Substantially increase traffic congestion in the streets.
(b) Increase the danger of fire or panic or otherwise endanger the
public safety.
(c) Overcrowd the land or create an undue concentration of
population.
(d) Impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property.
(e) Be consistent with the surrounding zoning and uses.
(f) Adversely affect the Comprehensive Plan of the Township.

shall have established by evidence the possibility that an allowance
of the application will have any of the effects listed in Subsection

the burden presenting credible evidence sufficient to persuade the
Board that allowance of a special exception or variance will not
violate the Zoning Ordinance with respect to the criteria so placed
in issue. [Amended 3-5-1991 by Ord. No. 177]
(2) Standards for specific uses. In addition to the general requirements

Reasonable fees, based on cost, are to be paid by the applicant and by
persons requesting any notice not required by ordinance established by
the Board of Supervisors. In addition to the notice provided herein,
notice of said hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected

officer. Where the Board fails to render a decision within the period
required by this subsection or fails to hold the required hearing
within 60 days from the date of the applicant's request for a

because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as
herein provided, the Township shall give public notice of said
decision within 10 days in the same manner as provided in
Subsection A of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall
prejudice the right of any party opposing the application to urge
that such decision is erroneous.
J. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the
findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him
not later than the day following its date. To all other persons who have
filed their name and address with the Board not later than the last day

or challenges which properly come before the Board in accordance with
the requirements of the Planning Code and all appeals to court shall be
subject to the time limitations and requirements of Article X 289and any
other applicable provision of said Code. The proceedings set forth in
said Article X shall constitute the exclusive mode for securing review of

pursuant to the Planning Code. Appeals to court shall be taken to the

pursuant to § 210-242A through D, the Board shall also hear all appeals
which an applicant may elect to bring before it with respect to any
municipal ordinance or requirement pertaining to the same
development plan or development. In any such cases, the Board shall
have no power to pass upon the nonzoning issues, but shall take
evidence and make a record thereon as provided in § 210-243. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall make findings on all relevant
issues of fact which shall become part of the record on appeal to the
court.

C. Parties appellant before Zoning Board. Appeals under § 210-242A and
proceedings to challenge an ordinance under § 210-242B may be filed
with the Board, in writing, by any officer or agency of the Township or
any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance under § 210-242C and
for special exception under § 210-242D may be filed with the Board by
any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such landowner.
D. Time limitations. The time limitations for raising certain issues and
filing certain proceedings with the Board shall be the following:
(1) No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board
later than 30 days after any application for building permit or any
other application has been approved or rejected by an appropriate
Township officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to
secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such
person alleges and proves that he had not notice, knowledge or
reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person
has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound
by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
(2) The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision on a tentative or preliminary plan pursuant to
Section 709 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code290 or
from an adverse decision by a zoning officer on a challenge to the
validity of an ordinance or map pursuant to Section 916.2 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code291 shall preclude an
appeal from a final approval except in the case where the final
submission substantially deviates from the approved tentative or
preliminary approval. [Amended 1-5-1998 by Ord. No. 221]
E. Stay of proceedings. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to
§ 210-244C of this chapter and during its pendency before the Board,
all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or
approval of the Zoning Officer or the person who administers the
Concord Township Zoning Ordinance or of any agency or body and all
official action there under shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or
any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property,
in which case the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the
Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition
after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body.
When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been
duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the applicant,
the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing
the proceedings before the Board. After the petition is presented, the

Code.
It is the intent of the Supervisors of Concord Township that the provisions
of this Article XXVIII comply with the requirements of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code as the same exists from time to time.292
Therefore, any amendment to the provisions of the Planning Code or any
inconsistency between the provisions of the Planning Code and the
provisions of this Article XXVIII shall be resolved by applying the provisions
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code as the same may then
exist, and such provisions shall be deemed to supersede any inconsistent or
contrary provision of this Article XXVIII.
court shall hold a hearing to determine if the filing of the appeal is
frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of
the case. After consideration of all evidence presented, if the court
determines that the appeal is frivolous and is for the purpose of delay,
it shall grant the petition. The right to petition the court to order the
appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver
may be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of
the court. The question whether or not such petition should be granted
and the amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the
court. [Amended 1-5-1998 by Ord. No. 221]

PBPD Planned Business Park District
[Added 10-13-1998 by Ord. No. 225]
§ 210-260. Purpose.
It is the purpose of the Planned Business Park District to provide for
the combining of offices, stores and shops, service establishments, hotels
and inns, conference facilities and limited industrial uses in a planned
development alongside the principal arterial streets within the Township,
which are U.S. Route 1, PA Route 202 and PA Route 322. It is the purpose of
these regulations to encourage a diversification of uses in a unified project
and, through interrelationship of uses and structures, to promote innovative
design, efficient and effective circulation systems and to encourage the
conservation of land and energy resources, minimization of auto travel and
the location of employment, hotels and inns and retail centers in proximity
to one another. In addition, the specific intent of the district is:
A. To encourage the development of land and buildings along U.S. Route 1,
PA Route 202 and PA Route 322 for a variety of uses, either individually
or within the same building, for compatible mixed-use developments.
B. To permit the development of functionally related land uses in a manner
that is more efficient, environmentally sensitive and mutually
supporting than conventional lot-by-lot independent development of
each use.
C. To minimize potential traffic hazards along U.S. Route 1, PA Route 202
and PA Route 322 by encouraging planned, physically integrated,
multiple-use facilities which are easily accessible from those principal
arterial streets and which utilize a reduced number of access driveways
along those principal arterial streets when compared to conventional
strip-type development.
D. To minimize auto travel by maximizing opportunities for pedestrian
movement and patronage of multiple facilities in a development which
emphasizes the interrelationship of uses and structures.
E. To establish a procedure that provides for:
(1) The overall design and approval of the roads, streets, sewer, water,
stormwater control facilities and common open space to be
included in a planned business park at the inception of the business
park; and
(2) The phased design, approval and construction of some or all of the
buildings to be included in the planned business park at a later date
or dates.

C. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain open
space or any successor organization shall at any time after designation
§ 210-276 WATER CONSERVATION § 210-276
196:947
fail to maintain the open space in reasonable order and condition
in accordance with any and all approved plans, the Township may
serve written notice upon such organization or upon the residents and
owners setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to
maintain the open space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall
include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within
30 days thereof and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon
which shall be held within 14 days of the notice.
(1) At such hearing the Township may modify the terms of the original
notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of the time
within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in the
original notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be cured
within said 30 days or any extension thereof, the Township, in order
to preserve the taxable values of the properties and to prevent the
open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said
open space and maintain the same for a period of one year at the
expense of the organization. The cost of any such maintenance
shall be borne by the owners of lots within the development from
which the open space was derived. Said entry and maintenance
shall not vest in the public any rights to use the open space except
when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the
residents and owners.
(2) Before the expiration of said year, the Township shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization responsible for
the maintenance of the open space, call a public hearing upon
notice to such organization or to the residents and owners of the
project to show cause why such maintenance by the Township shall
not, at the election of the Township, continue for a succeeding year.
If the Township shall determine that such organization is ready and
able to maintain said open space in reasonable condition, the
Township shall cease to maintain said open space at the end of said
year. If the Township shall determine such organization is not ready
and able to maintain said open space in a reasonable condition, the
Township may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said open
space during the next succeeding year and subject to a similar
hearing and determination in each year thereafter. The decision of
the Township in any such case shall constitute a full administrative.
decision subject to judicial review at the expense of the
homeowners' association.
(3) The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the project that have a right of
enjoyment of the open space and shall become a municipal lien on
said properties. The Township, at the time of entering upon said
open space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of
such lien in the office of Judicial Support of Delaware County upon
the properties affected.

Continuing Care Retirement Community Overlay District
[Added 12-7-2004 by Ord. No. 285]
§ 210-278. Purpose; legislative intent.
The Continuing Care Retirement Community Overlay District is designed to
promote a campus-setting continuing care retirement community (CCRC)
use on tracts of a minimum of 75 acres, as an overlay to certain portions
of the PIP Planned Industrial Park District and incorporating a small area
of the adjacent R-2 Residence District. Section 605 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code permits additional classifications to be made
within any district for the purpose of making transitional provisions at and
near boundaries of districts [Section 605(1)] and for the regulation of uses
and structures at, along or near major thoroughfares, their intersections
and interchanges and transportation arteries [Section 605(2)(i)]. The
Township of Concord has determined that there exists a need within the
Township to provide for a campus-setting CCRC use, consisting of mixeduse
housing and associated services for seniors, with integrated
independent apartment living, assisted living and skilled nursing
alternatives, in close proximity to the retail and commercial uses located
along Route 1 and to major transportation thoroughfares such as Route
1 and Route 322, in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of
the community, including the easing of traffic congestion along arterial
roads and the providing of housing and health-care alternatives for seniors,
and to locate such CCRCs as a transitional use between the significantly
higher-density commercial and retail uses along Route 1 and the nearby
low-density residential housing. The overlay district is designed to provide
regulations and controls relative to size, density and other area and bulk
requirements.
§ 210-279. CCRC use regulations.
Buildings and lots may be used or occupied for the following uses:
§ 210-280. Yard and area regulations.
A. Uses permitted by right:
(1) Continuing care retirement community (CCRC).
(2) CCRC independent living units.
(3) CCRC assisted living facilities.

slope and very steep slope, areas of floodway and floodplain
and floodprone areas (hereinafter "gross tract size"). The
minimum tract size for development of a CCRC shall not
prevent the development from proceeding in sections or
stages.
(b) Density. The maximum permitted density in a CCRC shall be 18
CCRC independent living units per gross acre of the gross tract
size, calculated on a minimum of 75 acres. In addition to and in
conjunction with the CCRC independent living units, the CCRC
may also contain up to 0.25 units or beds in the CCRC assisted
living facilities and the CCRC skilled nursing facilities for each
approved CCRC independent living unit in the CCRC.
(c) Impervious coverage. CCRCs shall be designed so that total
impervious coverage shall not exceed 40% of the gross tract

Route 202 is physically divided by land and private property. The properties
subject to the Route 202 Median Overlay District are uniquely affected
because of their location between the northbound and southbound lanes of
Wilmington-West Chester Pike, a principal arterial highway in the Township,
and the impact that existing and required future rights-of-way for principal
arterial highways, as applied through the Code of Concord Township and
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's rules and regulations,
have on the development potential of those properties. Provisions are made
for allowance of billboards, off-premises signs, and certain convenience
stores or mini-markets between northbound and southbound lanes of
Wilmington-West Chester Pike, consistent with the safety of the traveling
public and the health and welfare of adjacent property owners.
