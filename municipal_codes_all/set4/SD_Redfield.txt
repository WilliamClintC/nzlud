REDFIELD, SOUTH DAKOTA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Redfield, South Dakota 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 7, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Redfield, South Dakota Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1986, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Ms. Joan Marlette, city finance officer. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 06-2018, passed October 15, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 7, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

Chapter 13.16 - SEWER CHARGES 
Sections: 

13.16.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to generate sufficient revenue to pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the system on proportion to each user's contribution to the total loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength (BOD and TSS), volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to each user (or user class). 
(Ord. 3-82 § 1) 
13.16.020 - Total annual operations cost. 
    The city or its city engineer shall determine the total annual costs of operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment, replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests, and a reasonable contingency fund. 
(Ord. 3-82 § 2) 
13.16.030 - User or user class share determination. 
A.  The city or its city engineer shall determine for each user or user class the average daily volume of wastewater discharged to the wastewater system, which shall then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharged to the wastewater system to determine such user's volume contribution percentage. The amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude infiltration and inflow. 
B.  The city or its city engineer shall determine for each user or user class the average daily poundage of five-day, twenty-degree-Celsius biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all five-day BOD discharged to the wastewater system to determine such user's BOD contribution percentage. 
C.  The city or its city engineer shall determine for each user or user class the average daily total suspended solids (TSS) poundage discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all TSS discharged to the wastewater system, to determine such user's TSS contribution percentage. 
D.  The volume contribution percentage, BOD contribution percentage and TSS contribution percentage for each user or user class shall be multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the total volume flow, total five-day twenty-degree-Celsius BOD and total TSS, respectively. 
(Ord. 3-82 § 3) 
13.16.040 - Nonresidential BOD and TSS surcharge. 
    The city or its city engineer will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the cost of treating their above-normal strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to be two hundred ppm BOD and two hundred fifty ppm TSS. The surcharge rate structure for such above-normal strength waste dischargers is attached (Appendix A). 
(Ord. 3-82 § 4) 
13.16.050 - Annual nonresidential charge. 
    Each nonresidential user's wastewater treatment cost contributions as determined in Sections 3 and 4 shall be added together to determine such user's annual wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class of user and an equitable service charge may be determined for each based on an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The governing body may classify industrial, commercial, and other non-residential establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user with respect to volume, total suspended solids, and BOD. Each user's wastewater treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the rate schedule codified in Appendix B to this chapter. 
(Ord. 3-88; Ord. 3-82 § 5) 
13.16.060 - Wastewater facilities replacement fund.

13.16.080 - Review of charges. 
    The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage not less often than every two years and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the service charge system established in this chapter and to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. The city shall apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the costs of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next year and adjust the rate accordingly. If a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant modifications which would change that user's wastewater contribution percentage the user can present, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body, such factual information and the city shall then determine if the user's wastewater contribution percentage is to be changed. The city shall notify the user of its findings as soon as possible. 
(Ord. 3-82 § 8) 
13.16.090 - Annual notice of rates. 
    Each user will be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable to wastewater treatment services. 
(Ord. 3-82 § 9) 
13.16.100 - Rate schedule-Generally.

A.  Sewer service charges shall be based on the water consumption billed on the December 1 bill each year. 
B.  The city council shall have the power, by resolution, to reclassify the users of sewer facilities other than as set forth above, and to fix other just and reasonable rates of charges or rentals according to such reclassification, and to do this without necessity of amending this section, and to fix charges for premises in cases where the charge based upon water consumption of city metered water is inequitable, but according to the rates set forth in this section. 
C.  Such person as may be appointed by the city council from time to time to collect water rents due the city, shall also compute the amount due the city for sewage charges, and render a statement thereof, which may be made a part of any statement submitted for water used, to the owner or occupant of any premises served, or to both. All amounts due are payable to the collector of water rentals, together with the payment of such water rentals, but such amounts shall be kept in a separate fund known as the sewer rental fund. 
D.  The sewer charge shall be a charge against the owner, lessee or occupant of the premises, and against any or all of them, and any such claim for unpaid sewer service charges may be collected in a civil action brought for that purpose in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. 6-01 (part); Ord. 7-96 (part); Ord. 12-90 (part)) 
13.16.110 - Rate schedule-Out-of-town users.

Appendix A - SURCHARGE RATE SCHEDULE FOR ABOVE NORMAL STRENGTH WASTES 
    The city of Redfield, or its engineer, has determined that the average total suspended solids (TSS) and five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average residential user are two hundred ppm BOD and two hundred fifty ppm TSS. The city of Redfield, or its engineer, has assessed a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the average residential user. The surcharge will be sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users' above-normal strength wastes. Such users will pay an additional service charge of two cents per one thousand gallons for each twenty-five ppm over two hundred ppm of BOD and one cent per one thousand gallons for each twenty-five ppm over two hundred fifty ppm TSS. 
APPENDIX B - RATE SCHEDULE 
    All users with BOD no greater than two hundred ppm and TSS no greater than two hundred fifty ppm will pay a flat rate charge of four dollars and fifty cents per one thousand gallons per month for all flows. 
    Any nonresident user with BOD and TSS greater than the strength defined in paragraph one will pay a surcharge as shown in Appendix A.

2.  No other front yard on such lot shall have less than half the full depth required generally. 
G.  Depth of required front yards shall be measured at right angles to a straight line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines.

C.  Width of a required side yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the side lot line.

In such cases, the administrative official shall require a yard with minimum dimensions as generally required for a side yard or a rear yard in the district, determining which shall apply by the relation of the portion of the lot on which the yard is to be placed to the adjoining lot(s), with due consideration to the orientation and placement of structures and buildable areas thereon.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 06-2010, Arts. I-V, adopted Aug. 16, 2010, amended ch. 17.56 to read as set out herein. Former ch. 17.56, §§ 17.56.010-17.56.190, pertained to floodplain district (FP) and derived from prior code §§ 14.0901-14.0907, 14.09A01-14.09A04, 14.09B01-14.09B06; Ord. 31-85(part); and Ord. 3-89, §§ 1, 3-8, 10. 

17.56.010 - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods. 
A.  Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of South Dakota has in (statutes) SDCL 9-36 and 7-18-14 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Redfield, South Dakota, does ordain as follows: 
    The City of Redfield elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The National Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas of the town having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program was broadened and modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The National Flood Insurance Program is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of Redfield are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
C.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
7.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
D.  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 06-2010, Art. I, 8-16-2010) 
17.56.020 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its' most reasonable application. 
    "Area of future-conditions flood hazard" means the land area that would be inundated by the one-percent-annual-chance (100-year) flood based on future-conditions hydrology. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Area of special flood-related erosion hazard" is the land within a community which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After the detailed evaluation of the special flood-related erosion hazard area; in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone E may be further refined. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V.

"Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Existing structures"-See existing construction. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

3.  Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph A.2. of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
B.  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph A.1. of this definition. 
    "Flood elevation determination" means a determination by the administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.

    "Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Structure, for insurance purposes, means: 
A.  A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; 
B.  A manufactured home ("a manufactured home," also known as a mobile home, is a structure: built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or 
C.  A travel trailer without wheels built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. 
    For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in paragraph C. of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
A.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
B.  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

2.  The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. 
3.  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
4.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state office of emergency management upon issuing a variance. 
5.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half-acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection C.2. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half-acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
6.  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance (Section 17.56.010C). 
7.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
8.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
9.  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
i.  showing a good and sufficient cause; 
ii.  determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
iii.  determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
iv.  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
10.  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  the criteria outlined in Section 17.56.040D.1.-9. are met; and 
b.  the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. No. 06-2010, Art. IV, 8-16-2010) 
17.56.050 - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.  General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
1.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
2.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
3.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
4.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
5.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
6.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and, 
7.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
B.  Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) Section 17.56.030B., (ii) Section 17.56.040B.8., or (iii) subsection C.3., the following provisions are required: 
1.  Residential Construction-New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to at least one above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Section 17.56.040C.1.a., is satisfied. 
2.  Nonresidential Construction-New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to least one foot above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
3.  Manufactured Homes-Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
C.  Standards for Subdivision Proposals. 
1.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with Section 17.56.010B, C, and D. 
2.  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Development Permit requirements of Section 17.56.030C; Section 17.56.040C; and the provisions of Section 17.56.050. 
3.  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 17.56.030B or Section 17.56.040B.8. 
4.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
5.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
D.  Penalties for Noncompliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than two hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Redfield (community) from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(Ord. No. 02-2009, 4-6-2009) 
Chapter 17.64 - NONCONFORMING USES 
Sections: 

17.64.010 - Intent. 
A.  Within the districts established by this title or amendments that may later be adopted there exist (1) lots, (2) structures, (3) uses of land and structures, (4) characteristics of use, and (5) signs, which were lawful before this title was passed or, amended, but which, would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this title or future amendment. It is the intent of this title to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this title that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
B.  Nonconforming uses are declared by these regulations to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of land and structure in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of the ordinance codified in this title by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
C.  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction; provided, that work shall be carried on diligently. 
(Prior code § 14.1501) 
17.64.020 - Nonconforming lots of record. 
A.  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title; notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this title. Such lots must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided, that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the city council. 
B.  In any district, if two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership and of record at the time of passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this title, and no portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this title, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below requirements stated in this title. 
(Prior code § 14.1502) 
17.64.030 - Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only). 
A.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title. 
B.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title. 
C.  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district in which such land is located. 
D.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirement of this title shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
(Prior code § 14.1503) 
17.64.040 - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title that could not be built under the terms of this title by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
A.  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
B.  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent of its (reasonable fair market value) (replacement cost) at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this title. 
C.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
D.  Notwithstanding, if the property be damaged by fire or other natural disaster, the owner of the property may rebuild or repair the property to its prior condition or improve same and continue to use the property as a new nonconforming use property providing that the rebuilding or repair is completed within twenty-four months from the date of the fire or natural disaster. 
(Ord. 9-91; prior code § 14.1503) 
17.64.050 - Repairs and maintenance. 
A.  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current (reasonable fair market value) (replacement cost) of the nonconforming structure of nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be; provided, that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
B.  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with regulations of the district in which it is located. 
C.  Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(Prior code § 14.1504) 
17.64.060 - Conditional uses shall not be nonconforming uses. 
    Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this title (other than a change through city council action from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use at the date of adoption of this title. 
(Prior code § 14.1505) 
Chapter 17.68 - PENALTIES 
Sections: 

17.68.010 - Complaints regarding violations. 
    Whenever a violation of this title occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint.

Violation of the provisions of this title or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of various or conditional uses) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this title or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than one hundred dollars and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
B.  The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may be found guilty of a separate offense, and suffer the penalties herein provided. 
C.  Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Prior code § 14.2102) 
17.68.030 - Remedies. 
    In the event any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained or any building, structure or land is used in violation of this title, the appropriate authorities of the city may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use; to restrain, correct or abate such violation; to prevent the occupancy of the building, structure or land, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises.
