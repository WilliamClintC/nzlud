FOREWORD
History
This comprises the recodification of the ordinances of the City of Hermitage. Located in
Mercer County and first settled in 1796, the Township of Hickory was incorporated in
1833 from portions of Shenango and Pymatuning Townships. Following the incorporation
of the cities of Sharon and Farrell and the Boroughs of Sharpsville and Wheatland,
the remainder of the Township was incorporated into a First Class Township.
The Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law, Act 62 of 1972, provided all local governments
in Pennsylvania a unique opportunity of true “home rule.” On August 9, 1972,
Ordinance 13-72 was enacted by the Board of Commissioners, providing for a referendum
on electing a Governmental Study Commission of nine members. On November 7,
1972, the electors voted in favor of a Commission and selected nine members with the
task of studying present Township government and the alternatives of an Optional Plan
of Government or a Home Rule Charter.
On March 13, 1974, the final report of the Government Study Commission recommended
a Home Rule Charter, which was approved on May 21, 1974, by a vote of 1, 375
to 546. The Charter was to become effective on January 1, 1976.
A resolution of April 9, 1975, stated the Board of Commissioners’ intent to start an informational
campaign to consider the possibility of a name change for the Township. A
survey was conducted to determine possible names. In July, 1975, the Commissioners
petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County pursuant to the Act of June 14,
1957, P.L. 330. The petition contained almost double the signature requirement of 10%
of the registered electors of the Township. The questions to be placed on the ballot were
whether the name of the Township should be changed, and if so, which name — “Hermitage,”
“Mount Hickory” or “Hickory Hills.”
In November 4, 1975 municipal elections the voters approved, by 2,986 to 695, a change
in name and selected “Hermitage.” The Honorable John Q. Stranahan, President Judge
of the Mercer County Court of Common Pleas, issued an order on December 11, 1975,
decreeing that the name of the Township of Hickory shall be and is hereby changed to
Hermitage, Pennsylvania, effective January 2, 1976.
During 1975, the Commissioners also authorized the codification of Township ordinances
beginning with Ord. 1-49, August 4, 1949. From that date through December 10,
1975, 416 ordinances and one resolution of legislative nature had been enacted. In the
preparation of the codification, these 416 ordinances and the subdivision resolution
1954 were taken into consideration. Each was carefully analyzed and compared with
State law, court decisions and any later enactments on the same subject, and was further
considered as to modern needs and conditions in the Township. They were also
studied in light of the soon to be effective Home Rule Charter.
In July 14, 1983, the Hermitage Board of Commissioners ordained and enacted into law
the placement of a referendum on the question of an amendment of the Home Rule
Charter of the Municipality of Hermitage to be submitted to the electors of the Municipality
at the general election on November 8, 1983. The question presented to the electors
of the Municipality was as follows: “Shall the Home Rule Township of Hermitage
become the Home Rule City of Hermitage?”
The official certified election results on the question as submitted were 1,971 in favor
and 1,846 opposed; and with the passage of said referendum, the Hermitage Board of
Commissioners desired to put into effect the change of classification of the Township of
Hermitage to the City of Hermitage. Ordinance No. 18-83 ordained and enacted December
22, 1983, reclassified the Home Rule Township of Hermitage to the Home Rule City
of Hermitage.
The recodification of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Hermitage was prepared by
Penns Valley Publishers, a division of Fry Communications, Inc., and adopted by the
Board of Commissioners of the City of Hermitage on September 23, 1998 by Ordinance
Number 11-98.
Organization
The Code contains four parts which are one the valid current ordinances of the City of
Hermitage contained in Chapters 1 through 27,(2) the Appendix, which lists by abstracted
title all ordinances of a temporary or “one time” nature, (3) the Key to the disposition
of each ordinance ever enacted by the City, and four the Index, which is an alphabetical
arrangement of subjects.
In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific ordinances can be
located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each Chapter. The Index
may also be used to search for a subject when one is looking for general information on a
particular subject, or if it is not known in which Chapter the subject might be found.
The Appendix consists of several general categories containing a chronological listing of
short subject descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of
enactment, if known.
The Key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Board of Commissioners
of the City of Hermitage with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An ordinance
has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another ordinance, (3)
is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in the Appendix. Annual tax
rate and budget ordinances are located only in the Key. The Key is a cross reference to
the original ordinance books of the City, and to the location within the Code of each ordinance
by number.

PART 4
IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS
§ 8-401. Identification. [Ord. 3-2014, 5/28/2014]
1. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the City of Hermitage
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated June 9, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study; and
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments, are hereby adopted by the City of Hermitage and declared to
be a part of this Chapter.
§ 8-402. Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain
Areas. [Ord. 3-2014, 5/28/2014]
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM
as floodways and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at
any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information for those
special flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of
the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA
8:17 12/17/2014
§ 8-402 HERMITAGE CODE § 8-403
for which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has
been delineated.
(2) The AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has
been determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more
than one foot at any point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any
watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM
included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available,
the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point
on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the municipality.
§ 8-403. Changes in Identification of Area. [Ord. 3-2014, 5/28/2014]
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the City of Hermitage
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the special flood
hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes
available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the Special Flood
Hazard Area by submitting technical or scientific data. See § 8-501.2 for situations
where FEMA notification is required.

§ 8-404 FLOODPLAINS § 8-405
§ 8-404. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. 3-2014, 5/28/2014]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator, and any party
aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Zoning Hearing
Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 8-405. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes. [Ord. 3-2014, 5/28/2014]
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood
hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The community shall
adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to annexation or corporate
boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

TECHNICAL PROVISIONS
§ 8-501. General Provisions. [Ord. 3-2014, 5/28/2014]
1. Alteration or Relocation of Watercourse.
A. No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may
be affected by such action have been notified by the municipality, and
until all required permits or approvals have first been obtained from
the Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
B. No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity will
not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse in
any way.
C. In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or
relocation of any watercourse.
2. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments: any
development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the
floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without
a designated floodway which will cause a rise of more than one foot in the
base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not
limited to installing culverts and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR
65.12):
A. Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
B. Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased base
flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the post-project
condition.
C. Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community shall
provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map revision
upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44 CFR 67.
3. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within any
identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the
provisions contained in this Chapter and any other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.

subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is
shown on the FIRM as Zone A or AE.
START OF CONSTRUCTION — Includes substantial improvement and other
proposed new development and means the date the permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,

columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include
land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction"
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of

transfer of ownership or building or lot development; provided, however, that
the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into parcels of more
than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of access or any
residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE — Damage from any cause sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT — Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage or repetitive loss, regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
8:41 12/17/2014
§ 8-902 HERMITAGE CODE § 8-902

adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999, applicable to new
construction in all municipalities, whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to

administrative search warrant, pursuant to law, and upon obtaining
said warrant, enter the premises to conduct the inspection.

occupant or their designee who is 18 years or older unless the
inspection is conducted pursuant to an administrative search warrant
and the landlord and occupant both refuse to be present during the
inspection, in which event the Rental Official shall document the

completion. Failure of a landlord to pay the fee within 30 days of its invoice
shall be a violation of this Part.

1. Whenever the Rental Official, or his or her designee, determines that a
dwelling or dwelling unit is in violation of this Part, he or she shall, within
three business days of that determination, personally serve, or serve written
notice by certified and first-class mail, return receipt requested, a notice to

in or about the dwelling or dwelling unit, and service of notice in this
manner shall constitute service under this Part.

any tenant or occupant of the structure.
§ 11-109. Violations Creating Immediate Threat of Harm. [Ord. No. 2-2019, 2/
27/2019]
Upon inspection, if the Rental Official, or his or her designee, determines that a
violation creates an immediate threat to life, health or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or warn
the occupants in the event of fire or because the structure is so damaged, decayed,
dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of such faulty construction or unstable
foundation that partial or complete collapse is likely, or there is an immediate
threat of bodily injury to the occupants, the dwelling or dwelling unit will be
deemed uninhabitable, and the proper City official, or his designee, is authorized
and empowered to order and require the occupants to vacate the dwelling or
dwelling unit immediately. The landlord's license will be immediately revoked until
such time as the violation is corrected and the proper City official, or his designee,
has reinspected the premises and certified that the dwelling or dwelling unit is in
compliance with this Part.

his or her guests or invitees, or the general public, or an alleged violation of this
Part.

1. No license shall be issued to any person or landlord as defined herein for
purposes of renting or making available or permitting a non-owner to occupy
the premises if the person or landlord resides outside the County of Mercer
or a bordering county, unless such person or landlord provides to the City
the name, address and telephone number of a designated responsible agent
who shall be an individual, and who shall reside or maintain a place of
business within the County of Mercer or a bordering county. Such
authorization to designate a responsible agent shall be in writing and signed

service of process of the initial and subsequent pleadings on behalf of the
owner or landlord which may be necessary or deemed to be appropriate by

amount of no more than $1,000 and/or be sentenced to a term of

§13-602. Initial Review of Basic Cable Rates.
1. Notice. Upon the adoption of this Part and the certification of the City by the
FCC, the City shall immediately notify all cable operators in the City of Hermitage,
by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the City intends to regulate
subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized

views; and,
(2) Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable operator
filed its basic cable rates with the City.
B. If the Board of Commissioners takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City, the proposed
rates will continue in effect.
(13, PART 6)
12/20/2006 13-25
4. Extended Review Period.
A. If the Board of Commissioners is unable to determine whether the rates in
issue are within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the
Board of Commissioners shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator
filed its basic cable rates with the City and by adoption of a formal resolution,
invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to
make a final determination:
(1) Ninety days if the Board of Commissioners needs more time to ensure
that a rate is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or,
(2) One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-ofservice
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
B. If the Board of Commissioners has not made a decision within the 90 or 150
day period, the Board of Commissioners shall issue a brief written order at
the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep an accurate account
of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose
behalf the amounts are paid.
5. Public Hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on
the proposed rate, the Board of Commissioners shall hold at least one public hearing
at which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
6. Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed
initial basic rate may request the City Secretary to record the objection during the
public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the decision
resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the
objector must provide the City Secretary with the objector’s name and address.
7. Benchmark Analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate
schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, the
Board of Commissioners shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in
accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the Board of
Commissioners’ findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
A. If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall
become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator’s rates will be
capped at that level.
B. If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the
greater of the cable operator’s per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced
by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any
LICENSES, PERMITS AND GENERAL BUSINESS REGULATIONS
13-26 12/20/2006
change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992,
and the initial date of regulation.
C. If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator’s
per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the
initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation.
8. Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to
the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a costof-
service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic cable rates above the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard. The Board of Commissioners will review a costof-
service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The
Board of Commissioners may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark
if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-ofservice
determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable
operator’s September 30, 1992, rates minus 10% will prescribe the cable operator’s
new rates.
9. Decision.
A. By Formal Resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator’s
proposed rates, the Board of Commissioners shall adopt its decision by formal
resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
(1) If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or is justified
by a cost-of-service analysis, the Board of Commissioners shall
approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or,
(2) If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard and
the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the Board of Commissioners shall establish initial basic cable rates
that are within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or that are justified
by a cost-of-service analysis.
B. Rollbacks and Refunds. If the Board of Commissioners determines that the
initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or
that the cable operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the
Board of Commissioners may order the rates reduced in accordance with
subsection (7) or (8) above, as applicable. In addition, the Board of Commissioners
may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the
excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates
published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional
tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any
refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as
directed in the Board of Commissioners’ decision resolution.
C. Statement of Reasons for Decision and Public Notice. If rates proposed by a
cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part or if there were objections
(13, PART 6)
12/20/2006 13-27
made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision and the Board of Commissioners must give public
notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in
the official newspaper of the City.
10. Appeal. The Board of Commissioners’ decision concerning rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable Federal regulations.
(Ord. 6-94, 6/16/1994, §2)
§13-603. Review of Request for Increase in Basic Cable Rates.
1. Notice. A cable operator in the City of Hermitage who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the City
and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the cable operator desires the increase
to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually and
not until at least one year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates.
2. Expedited Determination and Public Hearing.
A. If the Board of Commissioners is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap,
the Board of Commissioners shall:
(1) Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their
views; and,
(2) Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date the cable
operator filed its request with the City.
B. If the Board of Commissioners takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the City, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
3. Extended Review Period.
A. If the Board of Commissioners is unable to determine whether the rate increase
is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the
Board of Commissioners shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make final determination.
LICENSES, PERMITS AND GENERAL BUSINESS REGULATIONS
13-28 12/20/2006
(1) Ninety days if the Board of Commissioners needs more time to ensure
that a rate is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as determined
by the applicable price cap; or,
(2) One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-ofservice
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
B. The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period.
C. If the Board of Commissioners has not made a decision within the 90 or 150
day period, the Board of Commissioners shall issue a brief order at the end
of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf
the amounts are paid.
4. Public Hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on
the requested rate increase, the Board of Commissioners shall hold at least one
public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
5. Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed
initial basic rate may request the City Secretary to record the objection during the
public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the decision
resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the
objector must provide the City Secretary with the objector’s name and address.
6. Delayed Determination. If the Board of Commissioners is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period,
the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund
if the Board of Commissioners later issues a decision disapproving any portion
of the increase.
7. Price Cap Analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as
being in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, the Board of Commissioners shall
review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form
authorized by the FCC. Based on the Board of Commissioner’s findings, the basic
cable rate shall be established as follows:
A. If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established
by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates.
B. If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by
the FCC, the Board of Commissioners shall disapprove the proposed rate increase
and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
8. Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in
an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the Board of Commis(
13, PART 6)
12/20/2006 13-29
sioners will review the submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service
review. The Board of Commissioners may approve a rate increase above the price
cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator’s
then current rate will prescribe the cable operator’s new rate.
9. Decision. The Board of Commissioners’ determination concerning the requested
rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by
other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons
for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting
the objection be recorded or may be submitted in writing at any time before
the decision resolution is adopted.
10. Refunds.
A. The Board of Commissioners may order refunds of subscribers’ rates payments
with interest if:
(1) The Board of Commissioners was unable to make a decision within
the extended time period as described in subsection (3) above.
(2) The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of the
extended review period.
(3) The Board of Commissioners determines that the rate increase as
submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator
failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the
Board of Commissioners disapproves any portion of the rate increase.
B. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance
with FCC regulations as directed in the Board of Commissioners’ decision
resolution.
11. Appeal. The Board of Commissioners’ decision concerning rates for the basic service
tier and associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable Federal regulations.
(Ord. 6-94, 6/16/1994, §3)
§13-604. Cable Operator Information.
1. City May Require.
A. In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed
an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the Board of
Commissioners may require the cable operator to produce information in
LICENSES, PERMITS AND GENERAL BUSINESS REGULATIONS
13-30 12/20/2006
addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to
make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request
the information be kept confidential in accordance with this Section.
B. In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate
standard, the Board of Commissioners may request additional information
only in order to document that the cable operator’s rates are in accord with
the standard.
2. Request for Confidentiality.
A. A cable operator submitting information to the Board of Commissioners may
request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for
public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of
the information and all copies of the information to which it applies.
B. If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically
separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this
is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies
shall be identified.
C. Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection
and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based.
D. Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of the subsection
shall not be considered.
3. Board of Commissioners Action. Requests which comply with the requirements of
subsection (2) herein will be acted upon by the Board of Commissioners. The
Board will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a preponderance of
the evidence a case for nondisclosure consistent with the applicable Federal regulations.
If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of
the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a
case for nondisclosure and the Board of Commissioners denies the request, the
Board shall take one of the following actions:
A. If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction
from the City, the cable operator may request that the City return the information
without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with this
request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires
will the information be made available for public inspection.
B. If the information was required to be submitted by the Board of Commissioners,
the information will be made available for public inspection.
4. Appeal. If the Board of Commissioners denies the request for confidentiality, the
cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working
(13, PART 6)
12/20/2006 13-31
days of the Board’s decision, and the release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
(Ord. 6-94, 6/16/1994, §4)
§13-605. Automatic Rate Adjustments.
1. Annual Inflation Adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator
may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually
by the final GNP-PI index.
2. Other External Costs.
A. The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the
basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the
extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These
factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, State and
local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service and costs of
franchise requirements. The total costs of an increase in a franchise fee
may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to
its relation to the GNP-PI.
B. For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and
franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for
which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on
which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation, or February 28,
1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be
adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred
before October 6, 1994.
3. Notification and Review. The cable operator shall notify the City of Hermitage at
least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items.
The City shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify
as automatic adjustments. If the City makes no objection within 30 days of receiving
notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect.
(Ord. 6-94, 6/16/1994, §5)
§13-606. Enforcement.
1. Refunds. The City may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion
of previously paid rates under the following circumstances:
A. A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in excess
of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment.
LICENSES, PERMITS AND GENERAL BUSINESS REGULATIONS
13-32 12/20/2006
B. The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the
City.
2. Fines. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order,
the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of $500 for each day the cable operator
fails to comply.

(2) Extraordinary Waste. In addition to the rental for "ordinary waste"
indicated in Table A, an additional surcharge will be made for
"extraordinary waste." The surcharge shall be computed by use of the
following formula:
Ds = CFV [(SS-350) + (BOD-300)]
Ds = the surcharge amount in dollars
C = cost per pound of removing pollutants (in dollars
expressed to the nearest tenth of a cent)
F = 6.24 — factor for converting parts per million to
1,000,000 pounds per million cubic feet
V = volume of waste discharged to the sewer system in
cubic feet.
SS = parts per million of suspended solids
350 = allowable parts per million of suspended solids below
which there is no surcharge
BOD = parts per billion biochemical oxygen demand
300 = allowable parts per million BOD below which there is
no surcharge
18:31
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
12/16/2015
§ 18-304 § 18-305
In the event either SS or BOD is less than the allowable limit while
the other exceeds the allowable limit, the surcharge shall be
computed only for the pollutant which exceeds the allowable limit. It
shall be added to the real amount based on meter size and flow, and
no reduction shall be made for the pollutant which is within the
allowable limit. The C factor shall be calculated annually by dividing
the annual cost of operating and maintaining the pollution control
plants by the pounds of pollutants (SS and BOD) removed. Such
calendar shall be made immediately following the end of the calendar
year, and the resulting C utilized for all billing for the succeeding
calendar year.
(3) In the event any user of the City sewer system desires to discharge
extraordinary waste into the City sewer system, which waste requires
treatment not contemplated in the formula set forth in Subsection
C(2) above, the City reserves the right to impose a surcharge on such
wastes based on its formula relating to the costs incurred to the
quarterly rental indicated in Table A.
D. Trailer Parks. Charge on the same as Subsection C — Industrial Commercial
and Personal Care Boarding Homes, except that in no case shall a trailer
park be billed less than the total of the existing single family dwelling rate
times the number of trailers.
E. All other classifications. Charged on the same basis as Subsection C —
Industrial, Commercial and Personal Care Boarding Homes.

E. Any other relative essential data as may be determined by the City as
necessary to determine the acceptability and suitability of permitting
such waste discharge into the public system.
No person, firm or corporation shall discharge, cause to be discharged
or attempt to discharge any extraordinary waste as defined in this
Part or Ordinance 6-68 [18, Part 1] to any public sewer in the City of
Hermitage until they shall have obtained a proper permit for such
action as outlined herein.
2. Industrial Classifications. Users shall be classified as Industrial according to

by the U.S. Bureau of the Census in their periodic "Census of
Manufacturers," a copy of which shall be available to the public for
examination in the City of Hermitage Municipal Building offices during
normal office hours.
3. Sewage Strength Determination for Surcharge. The strength of sewage
discharged to the public sewer shall be determined in one of the following
ways, at the option of the City:
A. Sampling; Average Characteristics. Samples of the sewage discharge
shall be taken at a sampling point provided by the property owner and
acceptable to the City, in accord with this Part and Ordinance 6-68
[Part 1]. Sufficient samplings shall be made to enable the
determination of a reasonable average value for the quality and
characteristics of the sewage discharge satisfactory to the City.
Samplings and laboratory evaluation shall be made by the City in
accord with the current edition of "Standard Methods for Examination
of Water and Wastewater" as published by the American Public
Health Association or regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection. The average characteristics thus
determined shall be used as the basis for extraordinary waste
surcharge calculations. The City shall review such average
characteristics as often as it deems necessary to maintain an average
characteristic with reasonable accuracy and at least once yearly.
B. Sampling; Individual Characteristics. When in the opinion of the City
a reasonable average sewage characteristic cannot be obtained as
outlined in Subsection (3)(A), installation of a device capable of
automatic sampling may be required. Such device shall be of a type
acceptable to the City, shall be installed in accordance with plans and
specifications having prior City approval, shall be installed in a
control manhole as indicated in Ordinance 6-68 [Part 1], and shall be
installed, maintained and repaired by the owner at his expense.
Sampling by means of this instrument shall be at times and in the
manner directed by the City in order to secure a reasonable and
18:33
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL

premises, discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids into the City sewer system either directly or indirectly obtains part or
all of the water used by him from a source other than the Shenango Valley
Water Company, then such water supply or source shall be metered in a
manner acceptable to the City. If the water from such water supply is not
measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter not acceptable
to the City of Hermitage, then in such case the City shall install a suitable
meter or have such a meter installed so as to properly measure all water
consumption on the premises. The meter size shall be determined by the
Township according to standard engineering procedures for sizing water
meters.
2. Meter Installation Costs. All costs for water meter installation including the
cost of the meter shall be paid by the City. The property owner shall be
required to provide access for meter placement and for subsequent readings.
The property owner shall also be required to pay a deposit for the meter
according to the meter size as shown in Subsection (4). This deposit will be
refunded in full by the City upon presentation of the receipt for deposit
payment together with return of the meter to the City in acceptable working
condition. The City reserves the right to withhold from any meter deposit
any sums necessary to cover unpaid sewer rentals or charges as of the date
of removal of the meter and any damage done to the meter while in the
possession of the property owner.
3. Notice of Intention to Remove Meter. Any property owner having a Cityinstalled
meter on his premises who sells or vacates the premises or for any
other reason desires to have the meter removed and a refund of his deposit
made to him shall give the Township written notice of his intention to sell or
vacate the premises or to install or have installed a meter supplied by the
Shenango Valley Water Company if such Company makes water available to
the premises. This notice shall be given to the City at least 24 hours in
advance of the time for removal of the meter in order that the Township may
have a final reading made, establish a final billing for the premises and
make arrangements to have the meter removed.

§ 18-308. Reduction in Sewer Charges For Water Excluded From Sewers.
[Ord. 11-70, 5/13/1970, § 8; as amended by Ord. 18-83, 12/22/1983]
1. Request for Reduction. Any user of the City sewer system paying sewer
rentals or charges on the basis of metered water who discharges less than
his total water usage into the sewer system may make written application to
the City for a reduction in his sewer rental because of water excluded from
the City sewer system. Such application shall be in a form acceptable to the
City and shall contain the applicant's name, address, and supporting data
fully describing other sources of water (if any) as well as disposition of water
alleged to be excluded from the City sewer system. The application shall be
accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale showing the plan of the
property, water distribution systems, sewer layout, existing meters and
proposed meters in the scheme proposed for determining the quantity of
water excluded from the City sewer system.
2. Metering Required. If it is established to the satisfaction of the City that a
portion of the water utilized by the premises does not and cannot enter the
City sewer system, then the City may require or may permit the installation
of additional meters at the owner's or interested party's expense in such a
manner as to measure either the quantity of water actually excluded from
the City sewer system or the actual quantity of water discharged thereto.
Meters shall be of a type suitable for the service they are to perform, shall
meet with the approval of the City, and shall be installed and maintained in
a manner satisfactory to the City. If it is desired to meter the water excluded
or diverted from the City sewer system, then all outlets for such water shall
be consolidated and measured by one single meter. If it is desired to meter
the actual flow to the City sewer system, a City-approved flow measuring
device shall be installed in a suitable manhole similar to that set forth in
Ordinance 6-68, Article VII, Section 8 [18, § 18-168]. All such meters or
measuring devices shall be under the control of the City, and they shall be
accessible to the City at any reasonable hour for inspection. If the City has
sufficient reason to believe that any such meter or measuring device is
inaccurate or in need of repair, the owner at his expense shall have it tested
and/or repaired and restored to accuracy to the satisfaction of the City. Such
testing or restoration to accuracy shall be completed within 60 days of notice
from the City of necessity for such action. A reasonable interim sewer rental
rate may be established by the City for that period during which suitable
metering is not provided by the owner, or the owner may be required to
establish suitable interim metering subject to City approval.
3. Sewer Rental When Reduction Allowed. Persons complying with the
provisions of Subsections (1) and (2), above, may be granted a reduction in
their sewer bills. The amount of the reduction shall be based on the volume
of the water excluded from the City sewer system. The rental rates shall
then be based on the net amount of the discharge to the City sewer system
plus any surcharges or other rental modifications, but in no event shall any
user pay less than the minimum rate for his classification as set forth in
§ 18-304.

4. Exception to Meter Requirements. If the City finds it is not practical to
measure either the actual sewage or the flow of diverted water, it may in its
discretion approve some other manner of computing or estimating the
amount of water diverted from the City sewer system.
§ 18-309. Rental Payments. [Ord. 11-70, 5/13/1970, § 9; as amended by Ord. 3-
81, 2/11/1981; and by Ord. 18-83, 12/22/1983]
1. Charges and Penalties. Bills for sewer rentals and charges hereby imposed
shall be rendered quarterly by the City on the first day of January, April,
July and October of each year for the calendar quarter immediately
preceding the date of the bill. Such bills shall be due when rendered and
shall be subject to a 5% penalty if not paid within 30 days from the date
thereof. If not paid within 60 days after becoming due, the bill plus the
penalty shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or fraction thereof
until paid in full. If any person refuses or neglects to pay charges for sewer
service or the connection fee as herein before provided within 60 days after
the same shall become due, the City Solicitor shall collect the same as
provided by law, by an action of assumpsit, or by distress of personal
property on the premises, or by a lien filed in the nature of a municipal lien.
In addition to the foregoing, the City shall have the right to discontinue
sewer service to the delinquent premises and to refuse to restore the same
until all delinquent bills and the costs of cutting off and restoring such
service shall have been paid. In addition if the owner or occupant of premises
served by the Shenango Valley Water Company shall neglect or fail to pay
any bill rendered to him for sewer rental or charge for use of the City sewer
system, the Shenango Valley Water Company is hereby directed, upon
request of the City, to shut off the supply of water to such premises until
such overdue rentals, rates and charges, together with any penalties and
interest thereon and the costs of cutting off and restoring such service shall
have been paid; provided, 10 days written notice of an intention so to do has
been mailed to the person liable for payment of the rentals or charges and
there has been posted a written notice at the main entrance to the premises.
2. Records. The City shall maintain such records as are necessary to document
compliance with all applicable EPA regulations as set forth in 40 CFR
§ 35.929-3 and as may otherwise be required by Federal statutes and
regulations. Said record system shall be maintained so as to enable review of
the user rental charge system at least every two years.
3. Inconsistent Agreements. The user rental charge system established by the
ordinances of the City shall take precedent over any terms or conditions of
agreements or contracts between the City and users (including industrial
users, special districts, other municipalities, or Federal agencies or
installations) which are inconsistent with the requirements of all applicable
Federal acts and regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency.

the ratio of water actually used to the "Allowable Quarterly Usage
Without Flow Charge" for the size of water meter installed. The ratio
thus obtained shall be applied to the "Quarterly Base Charge" except
that the minimum base charge of $22.25 shall be used for premises
with meters one inch in size or smaller. Any surcharges applicable
shall be applied prior to prorating. If no water has been used, the
rental shall be prorated on the basis of calendar months as detailed in
Subsection (1) with the ratio thus obtained applied to the "Quarterly
Base Charge" or the "Minimum Base Charge," whichever is applicable
as previously detailed herein.
B. Whenever sewer service begins after the first day or terminates before
the last of any calendar quarter and the cubic feet of water used
exceeds the cubic feet designated in Table A as the "Allowable
Quarterly Usage Without Flow Charge," the rental shall be the "Base
Quarterly Charge" plus the flow charge for the excess over the
allowable quarterly usage as designated in Table A and including any
applicable surcharges notwithstanding that the property is served for
less than the full quarter.

SCHEDULE "C"
Surcharge Schedule for Certain Types of Industrial Waste
18:48
HERMITAGE CODE
12/16/2015
§ 18-506 § 18-506
1. Although the sewage treatment works will be capable of treating certain
abnormal industrial wastes, the actual treatment of such wastes may
increase the cost of operating and maintaining the public sanitary sewage
system. Therefore, there will be imposed by the City upon each person
discharging such industrial waste into the public sanitary sewage system a
surcharge, or surcharges, which are intended to cover such additional cost.
Such surcharges shall be in addition to the regular sewage collection,
transportation and treatment charges set forth in the Joint Sewer Rate
resolution of the Authority, and shall be payable as other rates and charges
are payable.
2. The strength of any industrial waste, the discharge of which is to be subject
to surcharge, shall be determined monthly or more frequently as the Joint
Authority and the City shall determine, from samples taken either at the
manhole or metering chamber or at any other sampling point mutually
agreed upon by the Joint Authority and the City and the producer of such
waste. The frequency and duration of the sampling period shall be such as, in
the opinion of the Joint Authority and the City, will permit a reasonably
reliable determination of the average composition of such waste, exclusive of
stormwater runoff. Samples shall be collected or their collection supervised by
a representative of the Joint Authority and shall be in proportion to the flow
of waste, exclusive of stormwater runoff, and composited for analysis in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water and Wastewater." Except as hereinafter provided, the strength of
the waste so found by analysis shall be used for establishing the surcharge or
surcharges. However, the Joint Authority, if it so elects, may accept the
results of routine sampling and analyses by the producer of such wastes in
lieu of making its own samplings and analyses.
3. In the event any industrial waste is found by the Joint Authority, to have a
BOD in excess of 300 milligrams per liter, the producer of said waste shall be
surcharged an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in
thousand gallons per billing period, exclusive of stormwater runoff,
discharged to the public sanitary sewage system and the BOD surcharge rate.
The BOD surcharge rate shall be determined by the following formula:
RC = 0.00834 P (C — 300)
Where
RC = the BOD surcharge rate in cents per 1,000 gallons of waste
discharged.
P = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost of
secondary treatment process per pound of BOD received at
the treatment works. (Prior to completion of the first year of
operation the value of "P" shall be assumed to be $0.04.
C = the average BOD of the industrial waste expressed in
milligrams per liter as determined in accordance with
subsection (2) of this schedule.
The figure "300" appearing in the above formula corresponds to the maximum
BOD permissible without surcharge. The figure "0.00834" is the factor to
convert milligrams per liter to pounds per 1,000 gallons. No discount will be
permitted for sewage or industrial wastes having a BOD less than 300
milligrams per liter.

§ 18-506 § 18-509
4. In the event any industrial waste is found by the Joint Authority, to have an
average suspended solids concentration in excess of 350 milligrams per liter,
the producer of such waste shall be surcharged an amount equal to the
product of the actual volume of wastes in thousand gallons per billing period,
exclusive of storm runoff, discharged to the public sanitary sewage system
and the "suspended solids surcharge rate." The "suspended solids surcharge
rate" shall be determined by the following formula:
Rs = 0.00834 x B (S — 350)
Where
Rs = the suspended solids surcharge rate in cents per 1,000
gallons of waste discharged.
B = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost of
the sludge digestion, sludge drying and sludge disposal
operations per pound of suspended solids received at the
treatment works. (Prior to completion of the first year of
operation the value of "B" shall be assumed to be $0.04)
S = the average suspended solids concentration of the abnormal
industrial waste expressed in milligrams per liter as
determined in subsection (2) above.
The figure "350" appearing in the above formula corresponds to the maximum
suspended solids concentration permissible without surcharge. The figure
"0.00834" is the factor to convert milligrams per liter to pounds per 1,000
gallons. No discount will be permitted for sewage or industrial wastes having
a suspended solids concentration less than 350 milligrams per liter.
5. The surcharges provided for in this schedule shall be added to the sewage
collection, transportation and treatment charges imposed by the City.
§ 18-507. Municipal Sewer Rental Receipts. [Ord. 1-77, 1/3/1977, § 1]
All sewer rates and charges received by the City hereunder shall be promptly
deposited to the appropriate municipal account and shall be used to the extent
required to meet the obligations of the City of Hermitage to the Joint Authority
under and pursuant to the provisions of the Service Agreement between the Joint
Authority and its service municipalities.
§ 18-508. Municipal Rental Payment to Joint Authority. [Ord. 1-77, 1/3/1977,
§ 1]
The City shall pay monthly or quarterly as it may determine to the Joint Authority
the sum of $6.30 per month for each EDU that is furnished with sewer service by
the joint sewer system of the Joint Authority.
§ 18-509. Effective Date of Rate Schedule and Charges. [Ord. 1-77, 1/3/1977,
§ 1]
The rate schedule and charges imposed by this Part shall become effective after the
City of Hermitage is connected to the joint sewer system and on the date set forth in
a written notice to be given to the City of Hermitage by the Joint Authority fixing
the date when the rate schedule and charges become effective for the City.

B. The City may authorize the industrial users, subject to Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, to forgo sampling of pollutants regulated
under the Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the industrial user
has demonstrated, through sampling or other technical factors, that
the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
industrial user's discharge, or is present only at background levels
from intake water and without an increase in the pollutant due to
activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the
following conditions: (1) the waiver may be authorized where a
pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary
wastewater discharged from the facility, provided that the sanitary
wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and
otherwise included no process wastewater; (2) the monitor waiver is
valid only for the duration of the effective period of the industrial
user's wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five
years. The industrial user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual
wastewater discharge permit; (3) in making a demonstration that a
pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide date from at
least one sampling point of the facility's process wastewater prior to
any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all
wastewater from all processes; (4) the request for a monitoring waiver
must be signed by an authorized or duly authorized representative of
the industrial user and include their certification statement in 40 CFR
403.6(a)(2)(ii); (5) nondetectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved
method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection
level for that pollutant was used for analysis; (6) any authorization by
the City of a monitoring waiver must be included as a condition in the
industrial user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the industrial user in its request for the
waiver must be maintained by the City for three (3) years after the
expiration date; (7) upon authorization of the monitoring waiver and
revision of the industrial user's permit by the City, the industrial user
must certify on each report with the requirements and statement in
40 CFR 403.12 9(e)(2)(v) that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its wastewater discharge stream due to activities of the
industrial user; (8) in the event that a waiver pollutant is found to be
present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in
the industrial user's operations, the industrial user must immediately
comply with monitoring requirement of 40 CFR 403.12(3)(e); and (9)
this provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in the Categorical Pretreatment Standards,
except as otherwise specified in the Categorical Pretreatment
Standards.

immediately implement procedures to achieve compliance with the more stringent
limitation and shall notify the City in accordance with the requirements set forth in
this Part.
§ 18-713. Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
[Ord. 2-1998, 2/25/1998, § 203]
Where the City local water pollution control system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by Federal pretreatment standards, the City may apply to the
approval authority for modifications of specific limits in the Federal pretreatment
standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean the reduction in the amount of a
pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment
system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the
system in 95% of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set
forth in § 403.7(c)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, "General
Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution" promulgated

a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal categorical pretreatment
standards or with any other pollutant specific limitations developed by the City or
State.
§ 18-717. Accidental Discharge or Operational Malfunction. [Ord. 2-1998,
2/25/1998, § 207]
Each user shall provide protection from the discharge of prohibited materials or
other substances regulated by this Part. Facilities to prevent discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the City for review and shall be approved by the
City before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan
by the date identified in the wastewater discharge permit. No user who commences
contribution to the WPCF after the effective date of this Part shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until the discharge procedures have been
approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
shall not relieve the user from any responsibility to modify the user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this Part.
A. Initial Reporting. In the case of a discharge, it is the responsibility of the
user to immediately telephone and notify the WPCF of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration
and volume and corrective actions.
B. Written Report. Within five days following a discharge, the user shall submit
to the City a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge,
the duration of the discharge, the exact dates and times of noncompliance
and in the event the noncompliance continues, the time by which the
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored, and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WPCF, fish kills or any
damage to person(s) or property(ies); nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by
this Part or other applicable law.
§ 18-718. Notice to Employees. [Ord. 2-1998, 2/25/1998, § 208]
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other

§ 18-726. Reporting Requirements for Permittee. [Ord. 2-1998, 2/25/1998,
§ 306; as amended by Ord. 1-2007, 3/28/2007, § 8; and by Ord. 9-2010,
8/25/2010, § 6, 7]
1. Compliance Report. Within 30 days following the date for final compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source,
18:76
HERMITAGE CODE
12/16/2015
§ 18-726 § 18-726
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into WPCF, any
user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
City a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards or requirements and the average and, maximum daily flow for
these process units in the user facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards are requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance by the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by
an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a
qualified professional.
2. Periodic Compliance Reports.
A. Any user subject to pretreatment requirements shall submit periodic
compliance reports indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in their discharge. The frequency of monitoring and
reporting shall be as prescribed in the wastewater discharge permit.
Results of sampling above the minimum required shall also be
reported if analyses were conducted according to methodology herein.
(1) All significant users shall, at a frequency specified in their
wastewater discharge permit, but in no case less than twice per
year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the
nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and measured or
estimated average maximum daily flows for the reporting
period.
(2) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement
facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained
in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep
its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
(3) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this Section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required herein,
the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
B. The City may impose mass limitations on users where the imposition
of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required
by subsection ((2)(A) of this Section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature of the concentration or production and mass where requested
by the City, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
18:77
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
12/16/2015
§ 18-726 § 18-726
applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall
be prescribed in the wastewater discharge permit. All analyses shall
be performed with the procedures set forth in the USEPA publication,
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments
thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the administrator.
(1) The City may convert the mass limits of the Categorical
Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations
applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at
the discretion of the City. When converting such limits to
concentration limits, the City will use the concentration listed
in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455
and document that dilution is not being substituted for
treatment as prohibited by 40 CFR 403.6(c)(6). In addition, the
City will document how the equivalent limits were derived for
any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa
and make this information publicly available.
3. Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed
by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the authorized agent
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the authorized agent within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. The user is not required to resample if the authorized agent
monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the authorized
agent samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user
receives the results of this sampling.
4. Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the authorized agent
of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which
might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days
before the change.
A. The authorized agent may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 18-723 of this Part.
B. The authorized agent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
§ 18-724 of this Part or modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
C. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of 20%, or greater, and the discharge of
any previously unreported pollutants.
18:78
HERMITAGE CODE
12/16/2015
§ 18-726 § 18-726
5. Reports of Potential Problems.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause
potential problems for the WPCF, the user shall immediately
telephone and notify the authorized agent of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by
the user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the authorized agent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WPCF,
natural resources, or any other damage to person or property, nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other
liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Part.
6. Analytical Requirements. All pollutants analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR, Part 136, does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by
USEPA.
7. A categorical industrial user or noncategorical industrial user may request a
decrease in monitoring if its flow or loading is (1) the smaller of 5,000 GPD
or 0.01% of the WPCF's dry weather hydraulic capacity as measured by a
continuous flow monitoring device unless the IU discharges in batches; (2)
0.01% of the WPCF's design organic capacity; (3) 0.01% of the WPCF's
maximum allowable head works loading; (4) the industrial user has not been
in significant noncompliance for any time in the past two years; and (5) the
industrial user does not have daily flow rates, production rates or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement
for the industrial user would result in data that is not representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period. When all of the conditions
are met, the reporting frequency may be reduced to at least once per year or
more frequently if required by the applicable standard or require notification
of changes and resumption of full monitoring. The industrial user shall
notify the City immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no
longer meet the conditions as stated herein. Upon notification, the industrial
user shall immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting as
indicated in 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1). The City shall retain all documentation to
support the City's determination that a specific industrial user qualifies for a
18:79
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
12/16/2015
§ 18-726 § 18-728
reduced reporting requirement for a period of three years after the expiration
of the term of the industrial user's permit.
§ 18-727. Monitoring Facilities. [Ord. 2-1998, 2/25/1998, § 307]
1. The significant user shall provide and operate at the significant user's sole
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises but
the City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public rightof-
way and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping, parked
vehicles or pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
2. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating conditions at the expense of the users.
3. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the City or as specified in the user's wastewater
discharge permit.
§ 18-728. Inspection and Sampling. [Ord. 2-1998, 2/25/1998, § 308]
The City may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purposes of
this Part are being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or
occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the
City representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises
for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance
of any of their duties. The City, the PADEP and the USEPA shall have the right to
set up, on the user's property, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations and shall have the
right to copy records and reports of industrial users. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before
entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their
security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from
the City, the PADEP and the USEPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for
the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
A. Sampling Procedure. All measurements, tests and analyses of the
characteristics of water and waste to which reference is made in this Part,
shall be determined at the monitoring manhole. In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the monitoring manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at
which the building sewer is connected. Compliance determinations with
18:80
HERMITAGE CODE
12/16/2015
§ 18-728 § 18-728
respect to the prohibitions and limitations as stated in this Part shall be
made as determined by the City or as stated in the wastewater discharge
permit.
B. Cost of Sampling Operations. The cost of sampling, when completed by the
City, shall be borne by the user or owner as the City shall determine.
However, the City shall look to the owner of the property for any amount
which remains unpaid and which may be placed on the property as a lien to
be collected in the same manner as other fees. Normal operations of gauging
and sampling of any manhole or any point of discharge shall be the time
required, as determined by the City, to obtain representative samples of the
effluent discharged. Cost shall be based on an hourly rate for the person
sampling and any other cost that might be necessary to procure a
representative sample.
C. Cost of Analytical Work Performed. All costs for analytical tests which are
performed by the City, or by any other testing facility at the discretion of the
WPCF, and performed for an industry because of its discharge to a public
sewer and to determine compliance, shall be borne by the owner or user
being tested.
D. Cost of Installation Involving Overtime. Where a user discharges its effluent
to a manhole or manholes used as gauging and sampling points and the
effluent is of such volume and duration that the installation of hydraulic
equipment cannot be made until the user ceases operation by close down, the
costs of making the installation, involving overtime pay, shall be at the
expense of the owner or user. If the plant or premises elects to make the
hydraulic installations with their own personnel, the installations shall be
set up in a manner approved by the City. In the event that a period in excess
of five day, forty-hour week is required for City personnel to properly gauge,
sample and analyze the discharge effluent, the extra costs shall be at
expense of the owner or user.
E. Sampling by Users. If sampling by a user indicates a violation, the user shall
notify the City within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the City within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation.
F. Supplemental Report Requirement for Users. If a user subject to reporting
requirements monitors any pollutants more frequently than required by the
City using the procedures prescribed herein, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in the report.
G. Conflict of Laboratory Results. In the event that analysis of wastes, as
determined by the sampling and gauging of wastes from the user by the City
personnel, does not agree with an analysis of wastes submitted by the
industry or user to the City, a program of resampling and regauging with
subsequent chemical determination may be instituted as follows:
18:81
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
12/16/2015
§ 18-728 § 18-728
(1) The interested user must submit a request for resampling and
regauging and for subsequent chemical determination of the wastes.
(2) The chemist or engineer employed by the user responsible for the
analysis to be submitted to the City shall first confer with the City to
establish the length of resampling and the mediums to be used to
determine the flow and to sample the flow.
(3) The chemist or engineer engaged by the user may be present during
the resampling and regauging operation and also in the WPCF
laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis.
(4) The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and quality
of the flow, shall be considered the analysis of the wastes discharged
to the WPCF, or to a watercourse, by the user and the surcharge, if
applicable, or penalties shall be determined from the strength of the
wastes as reported in the analysis.
(5) In the event an analysis of wastes determined from the routinely
scheduled sampling and gauging of wastes from the user is not
considered representative because of breakdown or manufacturing
processes, or of treatment or pretreatment facilities during the
operation, and such breakdown or conditions are accepted by the City
as legitimate reasons, the user can request resampling or regauging of
the wastes after the breakdowns are remedied. However, the user
shall agree to bear all costs of the resampling and regauging
operation, plus the costs of analytical determinations. In such cases,
the City shall schedule the operation as soon as possible but not to
interfere with the rescheduled operations. All analytical results so
found shall be current and no retroactive refunds shall be made for
any differential in concentration established.
(6) It shall be assumed by the City that any user that has treatment or
pretreatment facilities and any routinely scheduled sampling and
gauging operations conducted that all test results shall be considered
representative of the user's discharge. If in the course of routinely
scheduled sampling and gauging operations the user claims that the
results of such sampling and gauging are not representative because
of breakdown or other interruption of the treatment or pretreatment
facilities, the City shall assume that such facilities are, in fact, not
being properly maintained and the results of the sampling and
gauging operations shall be used for purposes of determining the
penalty at the full discretion of the City until such time as another
routinely scheduled sampling and gauging operation shall be
conducted.

comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all Federal
categorical pretreatment standards and the user's wastewater
discharge permit within the time limitations as specified by the
Federal pretreatment regulations and the user's wastewater discharge
permit. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated and maintained at
the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review
and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility.
B. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as
necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the
provisions of this Part. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable
to the City prior to the user's initiation of the charges.
2. The City shall publish annually in the newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction served by the
Hermitage Water Pollution Control Plant a list of users which at any time
during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
noncompliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial users.
3. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the USEPA or PADEP upon request.
4. The pretreatment facility shall be subject to inspection by the City every 12
months, or more often if necessary. The user shall maintain operation
records and shall submit to the WPCF a report of the character of the

§ 18-743. Pollutant Surcharge. [Ord. 2-1998, 2/25/1998, § 403]
1. The Board may, by resolution, adopt a surcharge fee to provide for the
transport and treatment of a wastewater containing pollutant loadings in
excessive of the background domestic wastewater for which the WPCF was
designed and constructed to process. The daily surcharge shall be completed
by the following formula; a surcharge may be applied to multiple pollutants
as may be required to reflect the total cost to process the wastewater:
DS = CFV (pollutant — normal background concentration)
Pollutant = the pollutant concentration for the users
discharge determined by historical data or the
monitored value as outlined in the users
wastewater discharge permit.
Normal Background
Concentration
= for the WPC, the annual average concentration
for background pollutants of concerns shall be
based on actual influent analysis and/or
historical data for domestic wastewaters. The
minimum concentration for the base pollutant
parameters for which the WPCF was designed to
tract are:
BOD5 — 200 mg/l
TSS — 250 mg/l
NH3 N — 18mg/l
18:87
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
12/16/2015
§ 18-743 § 18-751
Other pollutants may be added as necessary to insure the operating
efficiencies and compliance with the system's most current NPDES permit,
the regulations of the PADEP and USEPA.
DS = the daily surcharge amount in dollars.
C = cost per pound of removing pollutants (in dollars expressed to
the nearest tenth of a cent.
F = 8.34 — factor for converting parts per million to pounds per
day.
V = daily volume of waste discharged in million gallons per day.
2. In the event the pollutant concentration is less than the allowable limit
while the other exceeds the allowable limit, the surcharge shall be computed
only for the pollutant which exceeds the allowable limit. It shall be added to
the quarterly rental amount and no reduction shall be made for the pollutant
which is within the allowable limit. The C factor shall be calculated annually
by dividing the annual cost of operating and maintaining the pollution
control plants by the pounds of pollutants removed. Such calculation shall be
made immediately following the end of the calendar year and the resulting C
utilized for all billing for the succeeding calendar year.
3. In the event any user of the WPCF desires to discharge a wastewater into
the WPCF which requires treatment not contemplated in the formula set
forth above, the City reserves the right to impose a surcharge on such
wastewater based on its formula relating to the costs incurred in treatment
of such wastewater. Such surcharge shall be in addition to the quarterly
rental fee.

conditions or revisions required. If the Board either disapproves the plan or
approves it conditionally, it shall cite the provisions of this Chapter upon which
it has taken such action. Within 15 days after the public meeting, the City shall
notify the developer, in writing, of the action taken at the public meeting, and
specifying what revisions or additions, if any, will be required prior to the
approval of the final plan.

in its preliminary plan approval within 20 days from notification, the approval
shall be automatically rescinded.
(22, Part 3)
303.3. Any revisions of the preliminary plan required, as prerequisite to approval, will

improvements.
(Ord. 18-91, 12/12/1991, §303)
§304. FINAL PLAN APPLICATION.
304.1. After the developer has received official notification that the preliminary plan has
been approved and what changes, if any, must be made if the plan is to proceed
to consideration as a final plan and has accepted these conditions, the developer
has 18 months in which to submit a final plan. If the developer does not do so
within the 18month period, the approval of the preliminary plan shall become null
and void unless an extension of time is requested by the developer in writing and
is granted in writing by the City before the expiration date.

changed substantially; or, (2) require changes in the plan, prior to final approval,
that will reflect any substantial changes on the site of the subdivision or in its
surroundings, that have taken place since the grant of preliminary approval.
304.6. It is not necessary for the whole plan that received preliminary approval to be
submitted as a final plan. The final plan may be submitted in sections, each
covering a portion of the entire proposed subdivision shown on the preliminary
plan. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the Board
of Commissioners may authorize submission of final plats by section or stages of
development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in
future sections or stages of development as it finds essential for the protection of
any finally approved section of the development. (See also §508.(4)(v) of the
Planning Code.)
304.7. The developer must provide sewerage and water system plans for the entire
development site of the preliminary plan regardless of the number of sections or
stages to be initially developed. (See also §503.1 of the Planning Code.)

of the plan will be referred to the Hermitage Planning Commission and a copy
referred to the Mercer County Planning Commission for review and recommendations
by these bodies respectively.
305.2. Before acting on the final plan, the Planning Commission or the Board of Commissioners
may arrange for a public hearing thereon. Adequate public notice shall be
given.
305.3. The Board of Commissioners shall take final action on the final plan no later than
90 days following the date of the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission
following the date that the application is filed with the Planning Department;

following the filing of the application, the 90 day period shall then be measured
from the thirtieth day following the day the application was filed. The Board of
Commissioners shall render its decision during a public meeting. The decision of
the Board of Commissioners shall be communicated to the developer in writing no
later than 15 days following the date the decision was made.
305.4. The developer may wish to seek a modification of certain regulations where,
(22, Part 3)
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this Chapter would result in
unnecessary hardship to the developer. All requests formodification shall then be
reviewed and considered by the Board of Commissioners in accordance with §1407
of this Chapter.
305.5. If after the review required by §305.1 the Board of Commissioners finds that the
final plan is in conformance with this Chapter, it shall sign the final plan. One
copy of the final plan will be retained by the Board of Commissioners for the
City's records.

this Chapter, it shall not sign the final plan, and shall notify the developer as to the
Section(s) of this Chapter that is not being complied with.
When the plan is approved with conditions, the formal date of approval shall be
deemed to be that date following approval by the Board of Commissioners
whereby the developer provides satisfactory evidence that all conditions set forth
by the Board's action have been met. In no event shall that time extend beyond 6
months from the date of the Board action.
305.7. No final plan shall receive approval by the Board of Commissioners unless the
developer shall have filed with the City financial guarantees in accordance with
§509 of the Planning Code in favor of the City, or shall have completed all required
improvements listed in Part 9 or as the City may require in the public interest.
305.8. Upon completion of the public improvements in accordance with the specifications
of this Chapter or those of the City, the developer shall take steps to dedicate the
public improvements and have the same accepted by the City, as set forth in Part
12 of this Chapter.
305.9. Unforeseen Circumstances. In the event the developer encounters unforeseen site
conditions while constructing required site improvements and such conditions
require changes to the approved design of the plan, the developer shall request an
amended approval in view of said conditions. This provision is strictly limited to
site conditions which could not be foreseen prior to the actual construction of
improvements.
(Ord. 18-91, 12/12/1991, §305)
§306. RECORDING OF PLAN.
306.1. After completion of all procedures and upon approval of the final plan, the Plan
shall then be immediately recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds. In no case
shall the final plan be recorded after 90 days from the date of the final plan
approval (see §305.6). Should the developer fail to record the final planwithin such
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
a period, the approval shall be considered null and void in accordance with §513
of the Pennsylvania Planning Code. Reapproval thereafter may be granted by the
Board of Commissioners, provided no changes have been made to the final plan.
306.2. The final plan shall be recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds before
proceeding with the sale of lots, issuance of building permits or the construction
of buildings.

to dedicate all public streets and other public ways to public use, unless
specifically reserved on the plan, and to dedicate or reserve all park reservations,
and school sites and other public service areas as hereafter provided. Approval
shall not impose any duty upon the City concerning maintenance or improvement
of any such dedicated streets, parks, areas or portions of same until the proper
authorities of the City shall have made actual appropriation of the same by
ordinance or resolution, or by entry, use or improvement.

PART 8
DESIGN STANDARDS
§801. GENERAL.
The design standards set forth by these regulations are intended to insure proper development
in the City of Hermitage.
801.1. The following land subdivision principles, standards and requirements shall
be applied by the City of Hermitage in evaluating the plans for proposed
subdivisions and shall be considered minimum requirements, except as
provided for above.
801.2. In reviewing subdivision plans, the City will consider the adequacy of
existing or proposed community facilities to serve the additional dwelling
units proposed by the subdivision. A reservation of land for community
facilities may be requested when appropriate.
801.3. The subdividing of land shall be done in a manner that will not have the
effect of debarring adjacent property owners from access to the streets and
ways of the allotment. The City may require dedicated, improved or
undedicated parcels to be provided for future access to adjacent land.
801.4. Land which is unsuitable for development because of hazards to life, safety,
health or property shall not be subdivided or developed until such hazards
have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards against such hazards
are provided for in the subdivision or land development plan. Land
included as having unsuitable characteristics would be the following:
A. Land subject to flooding or which has a high ground water table.
B. Land which, if developed, will create or aggravate a flooding condition
upon other land.
C. Land subject to subsidence.
D. Land subject to underground fires.
E. Land containing significant areas of slopes greater than 16%.
F. Land which, because of topography or means of access, is considered
hazardous by the City of Hermitage.
G. Land which is subject to ground pollution or contamination.
801.5. Proposed subdivisions and land developments shall be coordinated with
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT

existing nearby neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may
develop harmoniously.
801.6. Proposed land uses shall conform to the City Zoning Ordinance [Chapter
27] as applicable.
(Ord. 18-91, 12/12/1991, §801)
§802. STREETS.
802.1. Minimum street right-of-way widths and cartway widths shall be as follows:

[Ord. 13-93]
In order to determine the classification of a street, the following two tables shall be used as a
guide.
TABLE 802.1A - STREET CLASSIFICATION
Daily Volume Traffic (ADT)
Cul-de-sac 0-250
Minor 0-500
Subcollector 500 - 1,000

Daily Vehicle Trips per Dwelling Unit
Weekday Peak Hour
Single-family Detached 10.0 1.0
Multifamily Residential (including apart- 6.0 0.7
ments, townhouses and condominiums)
802.1C. The total traffic volume on a cul-de-sac street shall not exceed 250 ADT. The
total traffic volume on any existing or proposed minor residential street
shall not be permitted to exceed 500 ADT. Total daily traffic volume shall
be calculated based on Table 802.1B and shall include all existing as well as
all proposed dwelling units on the street. Where a new subdivision would
cause the total traffic volume on an existing or proposed minor residential
street to exceed the maximum ADT, then an additional access to the
development shall be provided as necessary to meet the standards
contained herein.
[Ord. 3-93]
802.2. In cases where a new subdivision is planned to join the street systemof an existing
subdivision, where the existing street differs from the above standards, then a
tapered transition shall be made to the new street, with the specific design to be
approved by the City Engineer.
Any street or way that is planned, though not already established, shall be
continued at not less than its width as planned.
802.3. Provisions for additional street width (right-of-way) may be required by the City
in specific cases for:
A. Public safety and convenience.
B. Parking in commercial and industrial areas and in areas of high density residential
development.
C. Widening existing streets (rights-of-way) where the width does not meet with the
requirements of these regulations.
802.4. General design criteria for streets not otherwise covered in this Chapter shall be
in accordance with specifications as set forth by the City and the typical
cross-section as shown in the Appendix of this Chapter. All details of the
cross-section including crown, curb (if any) pavement, shoulders (if any) subgrade,
storm sewers and roadside swales shall be followed.
802.5. Cul-de-Sacs.
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
A. In no event shall a street be allowed to deadend without a permanent or
temporary cul-de-sac.
B. Residential deadend streets (cul-de-sacs) may be permitted when it is clear that
through traffic is not essential to the street system in that district, and under
existing conditions. A dead-end street must have adequate turning space for
vehicles, which shall include a minimum right-of-way radius of 55 feet, and a
minimum road edge or curb radius of 40 feet.
C. Where a temporary residential cul-de-sac is proposed in a residential development,
the developer will be allowed to install a fully graveled temporary facility
adequate with a minimum radius of 40 feet; provided, that such a temporary
cul-de-sac will not be permitted for more than a 2 year period; and, further
provided, that the developer shall post a bond, in accordance with the provisions
of §502 of this Chapter, in an amount sufficient to construct a permanent cul-de-sac
according to the requirements of this Chapter in the event the street is not
continued in said 2 year period.
If the street is not constructed in said 2 year period, the developer shall construct
a cul-de-sac in full accordance with the standards of this Chapter. In such event,
the bond shall be returned. In the event the developer neither continues the street
nor constructs the cul-de-sac in a 2 year period, the City shall use the bond funds
to construct same.
Where a temporary cul-de-sac is proposed, the needed street right-of-way to the
tract boundary shall be clearly shown on the preliminary and final plat. The
right-of-way of any future street shall meet the requirements of this Part. Area
needed to provide the temporary turn-around may be provided by an easement.
Said easements shall be so designed as to meet the requirements for cul-de-sacs of
this Part. If the cul-de-sac shall become permanent, the easement and
improvements will be considered as a permanent dedication to the City of
Hermitage. If the road is extended and the temporary cul-de-sac is no longer
needed, then the easement will be terminated.
D. Cul-de-sacs in commercial or industrial developments shall have a minimum
right-of-way radius of 60 feet, and a minimum road edge or curb radius of 45 feet.
Temporary cul-de-sacs shall not be permitted in industrial or commercial
subdivisions.
802.6. Street intersections shall comply with the following requirements:
A. All curbs at intersections shall be rounded by a minimum radius of:
(22, Part 8)
Collector, Commercial and Arterial Streets 30 feet
Minor Streets 30 feet
Industrial Streets 40 feet
B. When fences, hedges or other plantings, structures or walls on any lot corner
would create a traffic hazard by limiting clear vision across a corner lot from a
height of 3 feet above the finished paved area, at the centerline of the right-of-way,
such structure and/or vegetation shall be removed in conjunction with grading the
right-of-way to provide a sight line of 150 feet along the centerline of a collector,
commercial, arterial or industrial street from the centerline intersections and 120
feet at minor street intersections. When an arterial, commercial, industrial or
collector and a minor street intersect, each shall retain its respective footage
requirements along the centerline to form the sight triangle. No building or
structure shall be permitted in this sight triangle. Sight triangles shall be shown on
the plan.
C. Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection exceeds 2%, a
leveling area shall be provided, if possible, with a transitional grade not to exceed
1% for a minimum distance of 50 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersection.
D. Intersections of more than two streets shall be avoided.
E. Minimum street intersection angles shall be 60 degrees. Right angle intersections
shall be used whenever possible.
F. Intersecting streets shall be separated by 350 feet or more, measured between
centerlines along the centerline of the intersected street.
G. Residential driveways shall be at least 30 feet from adjacent driveways on the same
side of the street and at least 50 feet from the centerline of an intersecting street.
For industrial subdivision, there shall be at least 70 feet between driveways on the
same side of the street, and at least 90 feet between the closest intersection and any
industrial driveway.
For commercial developments, there shall be at least 50 feet between driveways
on the same side of the street and at least 70 feet between the closest radius of the
driveway and the intersecting street. Shared driveways shall not be permitted
except in instances of land development on single lots.
802.7. Horizontal curves shall be laid on all deflecting angles along the centerline of
streets, and the degree of curvature shall be set to assure the proper sight distance
as required by Table A.
802.8. Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade exceeding 1%, and shall be
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
designed for maximum visibility as set forth by Table A.
802.9. In general, minor and collector streets shall not join into the same side of arterial
streets at intervals of less than 800 feet.
802.10. Half streets shall be prohibited. If circumstances render this impractical, adequate
provisions for the concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the street must
be furnished by the developer. Where there exists a half street in an adjoining
subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided in the proposed development.
The use of reserve strips is prohibited.
802.11. The provisions for the extension and continuation of major streets into and from
adjoining areas is required. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed major street, the City may require reverse frontage lots or such
treatments as will provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the
number of intersections with the major traffic streets, and separation of local and
through traffic.
802.12. When the subdivision adjoins unsubdivided acreage, new streets or reserved
right-of-ways shall be provided through to the boundary lines of the development.
802.13. Proposed streets shall be properly related to the official map of the City (if
applicable), and shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
802.14. Where a subdivision borders on, or contains a railroad right-of-way, an arterial
highway right-of-way or a stream, ravine, steep hill or swamp, the City may
require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way or
other obstruction at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening
land. Such distances shall also be determinedwith due regard for the requirements
of approach grades and future grade separations, and for nonresidential uses of
land, where permitted.
802.15. If the lots in a development are large enough for resubdivision, or if a portion of
the tract is not subdivided, suitable access and street openings for such
resubdivision shall be provided. Such access and/or street openings shall not be
less than 50 feet in width.
(22, Part 8)
1For arterial roads, PennDOT standards shall apply.
2Please see cul-de-sac definition - a cul-de-sac is the entire street not merely the vehicular
turn-around.
3Grades in excess of allowable percentage may be approved by the City Engineer where it
is clear that it is necessary and that no traffic hazardf is or will be created thereby.
4Sight distance shall be measured along the centerline of the street between points where a
driver's eyes at 3 feet 6 inches in height can see an object 6 inches high.

dimension of the block, if possible.
805.6. All lots shall abut by their frontage on a publicly dedicated street or on a street that
has received the legal status as such. Lots abutting on a private street or easement
shall not be approved unless specificallypermitted by theBoard of Commissioners
by special resolution. All streets, public or private, must meet the design and
construction standards set forth by this Chapter.
805.7. Flag Lots. The City of Hermitage, as a matter of policy, does not encourage the use
of flag lots. However, it recognizes that in certain situations it may be the only
practical method to develop road frontages which are associated with large lots.
For residential development, flag lots shall be at least one acre in size and have a
50 foot right-of-way to a public street. For all other types of developments, the flag
lot shall have a connection of at least 60 feet and shall be at least ten acres in size.

two horizontal to one vertical except under one or more of the following
conditions:
A. The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable to sustain a
slope of steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, and a written statement of a
civil engineer, licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced
in erosion control, to that effect is submitted to the City Engineer and approved by
same. The statement shall state that the site has been inspected and that the
deviation from the slope specified herein before will not result in injury to persons
or damage to property.
B. A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to sound engineering
standards for which plans are submitted to the City Engineer for review and
written approval is provided.
806.4. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum of 3 feet from property or
right-of-way lines of street or alleys in order to permit the normal rounding of the
edge without encroaching on the abutting property. All property lines, or rightof-
way lines, where walls or slopes are steeper than one horizontal to one vertical
and 5 feet or more in height shall be protected by a protective fence no less than
3 feet in height approved by the City Engineer.

existing salient natural features and land forms intrinsic to the site shall be
assessed. Terms of approval of a plat may be subject to the manner in which the
layout or design of the plan has preserved existing natural features, such as, but
not limited to, trees, wooded areas and watercourses.
807.2. Open Space. Where the applicant is offering for dedication, or is required by
ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or preserve an area of scenic or
(22, Part 8)
historic importance, a "limit of work," which will confine excavation, earthmoving
procedures and other changes to the landscape, may be required to ensure
preservation and prevent despoliation of the character of the area in open space.
807.3. Tree Preservation. Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed unless they are
located within the proposed street right-of-way, within the proposed building
area, well area, sewage facility area, or within utility locations and equipment
access areas. In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level shall be
maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.
807.4. Topsoil Preservation. All of the topsoil from areas where cuts and fills have been
made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after grading. All areas of
the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting on slopes of less than 10% and
shall be stabilized by sodding on slopes 10% or more and planted in ground cover
on slopes 20% or greater.
807.5. Landscaping. For all multifamily, apartment, office, commercial and industrial
subdivisions or land developments, a landscaping plan shall be provided and shall
include sufficient plantings for the required open space, planting strips, screenings,
formal gardens, shade trees and natural barriers.

adjacent and parallel to the street right-of-way in all subdivisions.
808.3. Where required, utility and drainage easements, not contained in the easement
adjacent to a street right-of-way, shall have a minimum width of 20 feet and be
placed at the side or rear of lots whenever possible. Utility and drainage
easements shall be required as needed to accommodate existing or proposed
utilities or drainage facilities, or as reasonably necessary to provide utility or
drainage service to adjacent unsubdivided land. In determining where drainage
and utility easements are required, the Planning Commission and the City
Engineer shall take the following into consideration:
A. The presence of existing natural watercourses, streams, drainage ditches, springs
or other natural drainage conditions.
B. The topography of the proposed subdivision as related to adjacent land at a lower
elevation, and the possible need to divert surface drainage from the lots of the
proposed subdivision away from lower lying adjacent properties.
C. The topography of the proposed subdivision as related to adjacent land at a higher
elevation, and the possible need to divert surface drainage from the adjacent land
away from the lots of the proposed subdivision.

affairs and the place where its functions are discharged.

payments, fees, tips and other compensation received by a person or his
personal representative for services rendered, whether directly or through an

governmental agency or payments to reimburse expenses or payments made
by employers or labor unions for wage and salary supplemental programs,
including, but not limited to, programs covering hospitalization, sickness,
disability or death, supplemental unemployment benefits, strike benefits,
Social Security and retirement.

governmental body or unit or agency or any other entity employing one or
more persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.
RECEIVER OF EARNED INCOME TAX — Person, public employee or
private agency designated by the City to collect and administer the tax on
earned income and net profits.
NET PROFITS — The net income from the operation of a business, profession
or other activity, except corporations, after provision for all costs and
expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or
accrual basis in accordance with the accounting system used in such business,
profession or other activity, but without deduction of taxes based on income.

2. Procedure to Claim Exemption.
A. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the person
reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits from all
sources within the political subdivision of less than $12,000 in the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event
that the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall
provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The
exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the
employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the
political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the
employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of
the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
political subdivision or except as required by Subsection 2B, the
employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the
calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all
times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of
hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form
provided by the political subdivision.
B. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of earned
income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in excess of
24:45 12/17/2014
§ 24-804 HERMITAGE CODE § 24-805
$12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local
services tax from the person under Subsection 2C.
C. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection 2B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder
of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person,
for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification under
Subsection 2B, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not
withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person
under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount due for that first
payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the
remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees. In the event that the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this
subsection is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person
shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the political
subdivision may pursue collection under this Part 8.

that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.

DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall

of overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75
days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is
required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever
is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for
amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The City of
Hermitage or the collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and
provide refunds to exempt persons.

situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in business within

from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for him within the
political subdivision and making a return and payment thereof to the
collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for
each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary,
wage or commission, and whether or not all such services are performed
within the political subdivision.

§ 24-805 TAXATION, SPECIAL § 24-806
2. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a payroll
period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for the
calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll
period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be
made on a payroll-period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in Subsection 4 of this section.
For purposes of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
3. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by more
than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
4. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer
and the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement
shall be provided on the form approved by the DCED.
5. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year,
irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a person
may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a receipt
of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
6. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the failure
to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's
principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an
amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer
complies with the provisions of § 24-804, Subsection 2, of this Part 8 and this
section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this Part 8.
7. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days after
the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 24-806. Returns. [Ord. 6-2011, 12/5/2011]
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax on
forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector. If an employer fails to file the
return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes collection thereof from
the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to an employee, except as
24:47 12/17/2014
§ 24-806 HERMITAGE CODE § 24-810
provided hereafter in this Part 8, the employer shall be responsible for the payment
of the tax in full as though the tax had been originally levied against the employer.
§ 24-807. Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment. [Ord. 6-2011,
12/5/2011]
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each calendar
quarter of each such tax year.
§ 24-808. Self-Employed Individuals. [Ord. 6-2011, 12/5/2011]
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or engages
in any occupation or profession with a primary place of employment within the
political subdivision shall be required to comply with this Part 8 and pay the pro
rata portion of the tax due to the collector on or before the 30th day following the
end of each quarter.
§ 24-809. Individuals Engaged in More Than One Occupation or Employed
in More Than One Political Subdivision. [Ord. 6-2011, 12/5/2011]
1. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
that a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more
than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to
collect the local services tax shall be in the following order:
A. First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed.
B. Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
C. Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.

declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie
certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
§ 24-810. Nonresidents Subject to Tax. [Ord. 6-2011, 12/5/2011]
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places of
business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services of any type or
kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the political subdivision do,
by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions,
penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part 8 with the same force and
effect as though they were residents of the political subdivision. Further, any
12/17/2014 24:48
§ 24-810 TAXATION, SPECIAL § 24-812
individual engaged in an occupation within the political subdivision and an
employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this Part 8, be
considered a self-employed person; and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the
political subdivision shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer
or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 24-811. Administration of Tax. [Ord. 6-2011, 12/5/2011]
1. The collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political subdivision. It
shall be the duty of the collector to accept and receive payments of this tax
and to keep a record thereof, showing the amount received by him from each
employer or self-employed person, together with the date the tax was
received.
2. The collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement of
this Part 8 and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to municipal
approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations relating
to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this Part
8, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any employer
subject to this Part 8, the examination and correction of any return made in
compliance with this Part 8, and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred.
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the collector shall have the right to
appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of
1998 and Part 9 of this chapter.
3. The collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll records
of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an
employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
§ 24-812. Suits for Collection. [Ord. 6-2011, 12/5/2011]
1. In the event that any tax under this Part 8 remains due or unpaid 30 days
after the due dates above set forth, the collector may sue for the recovery of
any such tax due or unpaid under this Part 8, together with interest and
penalty.
2. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% on
the amount of such tax shall be calculated, beginning with the due date of
the tax, and an additional penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.

within the taxing power of the political subdivision under the Constitution of
the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
2. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this Part 8 shall be held by
any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the Constitution of
the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as to
any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect or impair the right to

§ 24-913. Requirements for Request for Taxpayer Information. [Ord. 5-99,
3/24/1999, Exhibit A, § 101]
1. Minimum Time Period for Taxpayer Response.
A. The taxpayer shall have at least 30 calendar days from the mailing
date to respond to requests for information by the tax administrator.
The tax administrator shall grant a reasonable extension upon
written application explaining the reason(s) necessitating the
extension, which must amount to good cause. If the tax administrator
denies a request for extension, the tax administrator must inform the
taxpayer in writing of the basis for the denial and that the taxpayer
must immediately provide the requested information. If the tax
administrator grants an extension request, he must notify the tax
payer in writing of the amount of extension granted. Generally, an
extension will not exceed 30 calendar days in length, and may be less,
depending on the circumstances.
B. The tax administrator shall notify the taxpayer of the procedures to
obtain an extension in its initial request for information. Please refer
to the notice explaining the request for extension of time to provide
information attached as Schedule 1.
C. The tax administrator shall take no lawful action against a taxpayer
for the tax year in question until the expiration of the applicable
response period for submission of the information requested, including
extensions. For example, the tax administrator may not engage in any
collection effort until after the expiration of the response period. After
expiration of the response period, the tax administrator may engage in
collection efforts permitted by the LTBR and discussed in § 24-923
below.
2. Requests for Prior Year Tax Returns.
24:53 12/16/2015
§ 24-913 HERMITAGE CODE § 24-914
A. Except as provided in Subsection 2B, an initial inquiry by the tax
administrator regarding a taxpayer's compliance with any eligible tax
may include taxes required to be paid or tax returns required to be
filed no more than three years prior to the mailing date of the notice.
B. The tax administrator may make an additional subsequent request for
a tax return or supporting information if, after the initial request, the
tax administrator determines that the taxpayer failed to file a tax
return, under reported income or failed to pay a tax for one or more
tax periods covered by the initial request. Generally, however, the tax
administrator should not make routine requests for additional prior
year returns.
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in Subsection 2B
above, subsequent requests for prior year return shall not apply if the
tax administrator has sufficient information to indicate that the
taxpayer failed to file a required return or to pay an eligible tax which
was due more than three years prior to the date of the notice. Thus, in
situations involving failure to file a required return or to pay a
required eligible tax, the tax administrator shall, in his discretion,
have the ability to request prior year returns due more than three
years prior and supporting information.
D. Use of Federal or State Tax Information. The tax administrator may
require a taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayer's Federal
individual income tax return if the tax administrator can demonstrate
that the Federal tax information is reasonably necessary for the
enforcement or collection of tax and the information is reasonably
necessary for the enforcement or collection of tax and the information
is not available from other available sources or the Pennsylvania
Department of Revenue. The tax administrator may also require a
taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayer's State individual income
tax return.
§ 24-914. Notice of Basis of Underpayment. [Ord. 5-99, 3/24/1999, Exhibit A,
§ 102]
The tax administrator must notify the taxpayer in writing of the basis for any
underpayment that the tax administrator has determined to exist with respect to
any eligible tax. The purpose of this notification is for the taxpayer to understand
the exact reason why the tax administrator shall be written in a manner calculated
to be understood by an average person. The notification must include:
A. The tax period or periods (usually measured in calendar years) for which the
underpayment.
12/16/2015 24:54
§ 24-914 TAXATION, SPECIAL § 24-915
B. The amount of the alleged underpayment of the eligible tax detailed by tax
period.
C. The legal basis (including any statutory or case law citations) upon which
the tax administrator has relied to determine that an underpayment of an
eligible tax exists.
D. An itemization of the changes made by the tax administrator to a return or
report filed by the taxpayer that results in the determination that an
underpayment exists. A copy of any revised return or report in the tax
administrator's file must be provided to the taxpayer.
§ 24-915. Petitions For Appeals of Assessment or Refund of Taxes Paid.
[Ord. 5-99, 3/24/1999, Exhibit A, § 103]
1. Filing of Petitions.
A. A taxpayer has the legal right to challenge an assessment or denial of
a refund claim under the LTBR. However, a taxpayer has a right to
one appeal only. If a taxpayer loses an assessment appeal, the
taxpayer is not entitled to a second refund appeal after paying the tax.
In addition, no administrative appeals are provided for other
decisions, including but not limited to the denial of an extension of
time to provide information or the modification or termination of an
installment agreement.
B. The LTBR requires political subdivisions to establish appeals
procedures. In order to begin the appeals process, the taxpayer must
file a complete and timely petition (the "petition"). A petition is timely
filed if the letter transmitting the petition is post marked by the
United States Postal Service or actually received on or before the final
day on which the petition is due. Receipts from carriers other than the
United States Postal Service are not accepted as proof of timely filing.
Deadlines for filing a petition are as follows:
(1) Petitions challenging the denial of a refund shall be filed within
three years after the due date for filing the report or return as
extended or one year after actual payment of the tax, whichever
is later. If no report or return is required, the petition shall be
filed within three years after the due date for payment of the
eligible tax or within one year after actual payment, whichever
is later.
(2) Petitions for reassessment of tax shall be filed within 90 days of
the date of the assessment notice which has been sent to the
taxpayer by the tax administrator.
2. The tax administrator shall make available a form of petition for appeal and
refund attached as Schedule "2."
24:55 12/17/2014
§ 24-915 HERMITAGE CODE § 24-916
3. Contents. Any petition filed under Subsection 1A shall:
A. State the legal basis for claiming the refund or disagreeing with the
tax administrator's assessment.
B. State the tax period or periods (i.e., years) to which it pertains.
C. State the amount of the claim and the type of eligible tax detailed by
tax period.
D. Include all supporting documentation and calculations.
E. Provide the name, address and telephone number of the taxpayer's
representative, if any.
F. Include a statement certifying that the facts in the petition are true
and correct, under penalty of perjury and that the petition is not filed
for purposes of delay.
G. Include such other information (essentially identification) as is
reasonably requested by the tax administrator on the petition for
appeal and refund provided to taxpayer.
4. Hearing/Appeal on Record. The taxpayer shall have the right to request a
hearing in person or based on the petition and record (including information
on file or information submitted by taxpayer). A hearing based only on the
petition and record will not include any in person hearing or oral arguments.
The hearing office shall have the right to deny an oral hearing and/or oral
argument where the taxpayer has submitted an incomplete petition, or
where the hearing officer has determined that the appeal is frivolous,
undertaken only for purpose of delay, or otherwise without merit. If an oral
hearing is denied, the hearing officer shall notify the taxpayer in writing of
the denial and the basis for the denial.
§ 24-916. Appeals Board/Hearing Officer. [Ord. 5-99, 3/24/1999, Exhibit A,
§ 104]
1. Any taxpayer filing a petition under § 24-915 shall be entitled to a hearing
and decision by the hearing officer subject to a request for hearing and the
failure to deny the request for hearing. Decision on petitions shall be issued
within 60 days of the date a complete and accurate petition is received. If the
hearing officer does not act within 60 days the petition shall be deemed
approved.
2. Any person aggrieved by a decision under this Section who has direct
interest in the decision shall have the right to appeal to the court of common
pleas of the County of Mercer vested with the jurisdiction of local tax appeals
by or pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5571(b).

address and telephone number.
2. Copies of notices or communications may be sent by the tax administrator or
other representative of the political subdivision to the taxpayer's

representative (for example, requesting an extension of time or submitting
factual information) shall have the same force or effect as if taken directly by
the taxpayer.
3. Reasonable notice of the hearing date will be provided to the taxpayer by the
hearing officer. The notice shall provide the date, time and place of a

received at least five days before the scheduled hearing date.
5. The hearing officer shall preside and keep order over any scheduled hearing.
Hearings need not adhere to any technical rules of evidence, but oral

hearing officer, deposition or affidavits may be used in lieu of oral testimony.
6. The hearing officer shall have the authority to take the following actions:
A. Delegate the hearing schedule to an employee, agent or other

shall be made within three years after the due date for payment of the tax or
within one year after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later.
2. A tax return filed by the taxpayer showing an overpayment shall be deemed
to be a written request for a cash refund unless otherwise indicated on the
tax return.

under § 24-915 and shall not preclude a taxpayer from submitting a petition
under § 24-915.

an underpayment, a written request for refund shall be filed within one year

B. Interest is not required to be paid on taxpayer overpayments of
interest or a penalty(ies).
4. Acceptance of Refund Checks. The taxpayer's acceptance of a refund check
from the tax administrator or political subdivision shall not prejudice any

which is attributable in whole or in part to any error or delay by the
tax administrator in the performance of a ministerial act. For
purposes of this subsection, an error or delay shall be taken into
account only if no significant aspect of the error or delay can be
attributed to the taxpayer and after the tax administrator has
contacted the taxpayer in writing with respect to the underpayment of
tax finally determined to be due or payable.
B. Any payment of an eligible tax to the extent that any error or delay in
the payment is attributable to an officer, employee or agent of the tax

was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer.

result from a failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate
information to the tax administrator.

taxpayer. Taxpayers shall not have any right to compel the tax

that collection of the eligible tax under the installment
agreement is in jeopardy.

only if the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The tax administrator provides a notice of its findings to the
taxpayer no later than 30 days prior to the date of change of
the installment agreement.
(b) The notice given by the tax administrator to the taxpayer

C. Disclosure Statement Under the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights.
24:63 12/17/2014
§ 24-931 HERMITAGE CODE § 24-931
§ 24-931. Disclosure Statement Under The Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights.
[Ord. 5-99, 3/24/1999, Exhibit B]
1. It is the obligation of all taxpayers to file all local tax returns voluntarily and
pay all local taxes to which they are subject. However, when the duly
appointed or elected tax collector or tax collection agency for the municipality
and/or school district in which the taxpayer resides determines that a
required return has not been filed, or a tax liability has not been paid, the
Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights grants certain legal rights to taxpayers and
imposes obligations on taxing authorities to ensure that equity and fairness
guide local governments in collection of taxes. In addition, the Local
Taxpayers Bill of Rights provides the local government entity with certain
legal methods to enforce taxpayer obligations. This disclosure statement set
forth your rights as a taxpayer in connection with any audit, examination,
appeal or refund claim of taxes for the City of Hermitage/Hermitage School
District and any enforcement or collection actions taken by the Hermitage
Wage Office on behalf of the City of Hermitage/Hermitage School District.
2. Applicability/Eligible Taxes. This disclosure statement applies to all eligible
taxes levied by the City of Hermitage/Hermitage School District. For this
purpose, eligible taxes do not include real property taxes. The specific
eligible tax(es) levied by the City of Hermitage/Hermitage School District
include all taxes levied under the local Tax Enabling Act (Act 511), as well as
any per capita, occupation, occupation assessment, occupational privilege,
income, gross receipts, privilege, amusement, admission, earned income or
net profits tax. Unless expressly provided in the Local Taxpayers Bill of
Rights, the failure of any person acting on behalf of the tax administrator to
comply with any provisions of this disclosure statement, related regulations
or the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights will not excuse the taxpayer from
paying the taxes owned.
3. Audit/or Examinations. If we contact you about your tax return or payment
of any eligible taxes, we will send you a letter with either a request for more
information or a reason why we believe a change to your return or taxes may
be needed. If we request information, you will have 30 calendar days from
the date of the mailing to respond. Reasonable extensions of such time will
be granted upon application for good cause. We will notify you of the
procedures to obtain an extension with our initial request for tax
information. Our initial inquiry may include taxes required to be paid or tax
returns required to be filed no more than three years prior to the mailing
date of our notice. If you give us the requested information or provide an
explanation, we may or may not agree with you. If we do not agree with you,
we will explain in writing our reasons for asserting that you owe us tax
(which we call "an underpayment"). Our explanation will include: A) the tax
period or periods for which the underpayment is asserted; B) the amount of
the underpayment detailed by tax period; C) the legal basis upon which we
have relied to determine that an underpayment exists; and D) an itemization
of the revisions made by us to your return or report that results in our
12/17/2014 24:64
§ 24-931 TAXATION, SPECIAL § 24-931
decision that an underpayment exists. If you agree with our changes, you
should pay the additional tax.
4. Requests for Prior Year Returns. An initial request by the tax administrator
into prior year returns may cover tax returns required to be filed as bar
black as three years prior to the mailing date of the notice. If the tax
administrator determines that the taxpayer failed to file a tax return, under
reported income or failed to pay a tax for one or more of the tax periods
covered by the initial request, the tax administrator may request additional
information. The tax administrator may also require a taxpayer to provide
copies of Federal and Pennsylvania tax returns when the tax administrator
can show that the taxpayer's Federal tax return(s) is (are) reasonably
necessary for the enforcement or collection of tax, and the information is not
available from other sources or the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.
5. Appeals of Decisions.
A. If we notify you that you owe more tax (what we call an "assessment")
and you do not agree with our decision, you may appeal or seek review
by filing a petition for reassessment within 90 days of the date of the
mailing of the assessment notice. The petition must either be in our
hands or postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service within this ninety-day
period. Receipts from other carriers (such as Federal Express) are not
accepted as proof of delivery.
B. Your petition must explain the legal basis for your position and
include all supporting documents. For your convenience, a form for
submission of a petition is available at 900 North Hermitage Road,
Hermitage, PA 16148. Your petition must be mailed or delivered to

District will be made within 60 days of the date your complete and
accurate petition is received. If you do not agree with the decision of
the hearing officer, you may appeal to the appropriate Court of
Common Pleas of Mercer County. You must file your appeal within 30
days after notice of the decision of the hearing officer.
6. Refunds. You may file a claim for a refund ("refund claim") if you think you
paid too much tax (what we call an "overpayment"). You must file the refund
claim within three years of the due date for filing the return as extended or
one year after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no report or
local tax return is required for the tax, the refund claim must be made
within three years after the due date for payment of the tax or within one
24:65 12/17/2014
§ 24-931 HERMITAGE CODE § 24-931
year after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later. If your refund claim
relates to amounts paid as a result of a notice asserting an underpayment of
tax, your request for refund claim must be filed within one year of the date of
payment. Refund claims must be made on forms prescribed by us and must
include supporting documentation. You can obtain forms for refund claims by
contacting us at 900 North Hermitage Road, Hermitage, Pennsylvania
16148. Your refund claims must be filed with us at 900 North Hermitage

7. Enforcement Procedures. Once it has been determined that you owe tax, we
will take action we are legally permitted to take to enforce our claim. Such
action may include obtaining additional information from you, auditing your
records, entering into a settlement with you of the disputed amount of the
tax or obtaining liens on your property, wage attachments, levies and
seizures and sales of your property in appropriate circumstances. We may
enter into a written agreement will facilitate collection. We may also impose
interest and applicable penalties on the tax you owe, and may seek criminal
prosecution of you in appropriate circumstances.
8. Tax Information Confidentiality. Information gained by the tax
administrator or hearing officer as a result of any audit, return, report,
investigation, hearing, appeal or verification shall be confidential. However,
confidentially will not preclude disclosure for official purposes, whether in
connection with legal proceedings or otherwise, and it will not preclude
disclosure to the extent required by applicable law.

- 13 -
H. The City of Hermitage may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this Section at
any time for any project that the City believes may pose a threat to public health,
safety, property or the environment.
103.3 Volume Controls
The Low Impact Development practices, like those provided in the BMP Manual shall be
utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Water volume controls
shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method
in Subsection B. For regulated activity areas equal or less than 1 acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Ordinance establishes no preference
for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on the basis of
economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures
associated with each methodology, and other factors.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any size of
regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
1. Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all storms equal to
or less than the 2-year 24-hour duration precipitation.
2. For hydrologic modeling purposes:
a. Existing pre-development non-forested pervious areas must be considered
meadow or its equivalent in good condition.
b. Existing pre-development impervious areas, when present, must consider
twenty (20) percent of the impervious area as meadow in good condition.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of site conditions
and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not
applicable to regulated activities greater than one (1) acre or for projects that require
design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
1. Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches (2") of runoff from
all new impervious surfaces.
2. At least the first one inch (1") of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the
surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
3. Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate
infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at
least the first one-half inch (0.5") of the permanently removed runoff should be
infiltrated.
- 14 -
4. This method is exempt from the requirements of Section 103.4 (Rate Controls).
103.4 Rate Controls
Post-development peak discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development peak discharge
rates for the 2-year, 10-year, 25-year, and 100-year storm events.
103.5 Calculation Methodology
Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using either the Rational
Method (stormwater conveyance systems only) or a soil cover complex methodology as follows:
A. Major and minor conveyance systems up to 20 acres may be designed using the
Rational Method. The Rational Method may also be used in sizing the minor
conveyance systems for larger sites. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving
drainage areas greater than 20 acres, including on-site and off-site areas, shall use a
generally accepted runoff hydrograph technique that is based on the NRCS Soil
Cover Complex method. Runoff hydrograph methods must be used for design of all
stormwater management facilities and for major drainage system designs for all
systems with greater than 20 acres of drainage area.
B. All calculations consistent with this Ordinance using the Soil Cover Complex method
shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms
presented in Section 103.1 (General Requirements), Item L. If a hydrologic computer
model is used for stormwater runoff calculations, the duration of rainfall shall be 24
hours. The SCS Rainfall Type II curve shall be used for the rainfall distribution.
C. For the purposes of existing pre-development runoff rate determination, undeveloped
non-forested pervious areas including disturbed areas must be considered meadow in
good condition or its equivalent in good condition. Those areas that have existing
impervious areas within the planned development area may be included in the
determination of the pre-development flow rate.
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities from the
Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0,
U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center,
Silver Spring, Maryland. NOAA’s Atlas 14 can be accessed at:
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
E. Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology
presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55.
Travel time for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using velocities determined
using Manning’s equation.
- 15 -
F. Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing (pre-development) and proposed (postdevelopment)
conditions to be used in the Soil Cover Complex method shall be
obtained from Chapter 2 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55.
G. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used for hydraulic
computations such as the capacity of open channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values
for Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Pub. 584, PennDOT
Drainage Manual Section 7.3. Inlet-outlet losses and conditions must be considered.
H. Outlet structures for stormwater storage facilities shall be designed to meet the
performance standards of this Ordinance using any generally accepted hydraulic
analysis technique or method. Orifices smaller than 3 inches diameter are not
recommended; however, if the qualified professional can provide proof that the
smaller orifices are protected from clogging by use of anti-clogging devices, the
smaller orifices may then be permitted.
I. The design of any stormwater storage facilities intended to meet the performance
standards of this Ordinance shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through these facilities.
J. Runoff coefficients (C) for both existing (pre-development) and proposed (postdevelopment)
conditions for use in the Rational method shall be:

104.1 Small Project Application (2,500 - 5,000 Sq. Ft. of Impervious Area)
This section applies to projects creating new Total Impervious Surface Area up to 5,000 square
feet.
If the Total Impervious Surface Area is 2,500 square feet to 5,000 square feet, the project
requires a Small Project Application to be submitted to the City and volume controls must be
installed to meet the requirements of the surface area or volume of BMPs required.
For areas where runoff from impervious areas can be directed to pervious areas that allow for
infiltration, filtration, and increased time of concentration, Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA)
Credits may be used. To qualify as DIA the concentrated discharge must meet the following
criteria:
For Rooftop Areas:
1. Area draining to a downspout must be 500 square feet or less,
2. Discharge must be to an area with a positive slope of 5% (one foot of fall per twenty
feet of length, 20:1) or less, and
3. Be a minimum distance of 75-feet from a watercourse or down slope property line.
For Paved Areas (driveways, sidewalks, etc.):
1. Runoff draining to a point must be 1,000 square feet or less,
2. Discharge must be to a gravel strip or spreading device, and the
3. Flow length of the pervious surface must be greater than or equal to the contributing
length.
Subtract the DIA from the Total Impervious Surface Area to determine the Adjusted Impervious
Surface Area (AISA). Multiply the AISA by 0.2 to determine the required surface area of rain
gardens, which shall have a ponded water depth of 6-inches. Multiply the AISA by 0.5 to
determine the (rock) volume of subsurface (rock filled) infiltration beds, which shall have a
maximum rock depth of 30 inches.
BMPs shall be constructed to the City's standards or in accordance with the Pennsylvania BMP
Manual, latest version.
This section shall also permit the use of the design standards of Section 104.2.

and within each group listed by title in chronological order. The annual budget and
tax ordinances have been listed only in the “Key to the Disposition of Ordinances.” Any
person who desires to read the full text of any of the ordinances or resolutions may do so
by consulting the original Ordinance Books on file in the City Offices.
The enactments included in this Appendix are grouped under the following headings:

PART 3
DISTRICT REGULATIONS
301. ZONING MAP
A map entitled the City of Hermitage Zoning Map is hereby adopted as part of this Ordinance. The
Zoning Map shall be kept on file and be available for examination at the Municipal Building.
302. ZONING DISTRICTS
The City is divided into the districts set forth by this Ordinance and as shown by the district boundaries
on the Zoning Map. The districts are:
302.10 Residential Districts
Districts designated for residential use are for dwellings and uses normally associated with residential
neighborhoods. Such uses may include schools, churches and related activities. The specific purpose
for each of the residential districts is as follows:
302.10(a) R-1 Single-Family Residential District. These zones are primarily intended for
single-family dwellings and related uses. There are two "R-l" zones.
302.10(b) R-2 General Residential District. R-2 General Residential District is designed to
accommodate single, two-family and multifamily residences where utilities, access and location
warrant such development. There are three "R-2" zones.
302.10(c) R-3 Residential/Office District. R-3 Residential/Office District is designed to
accommodate single, two-family and multifamily residences, with limited compatible
nonresidential development also permitted, such as office buildings and day-care centers.
302.10(d) R-4 Residential High Density Development District. R-4 Residential High Density
Development District is designed to accommodate single, two-family and multifamily
residences, with limited nonresidential development also permitted, such as office buildings,
low-volume retail and hotels and motels.
302.20 Commercial Districts
The Commercial Districts are designed to provide for needed commercial and related activities within
the City.
302.20(a) CC-1 Central Commercial. CC-1 Central Commercial is designed to accommodate a
wide range of commercial and related uses.
302.20(b) CC-2 Central Commercial. The uses in this district are the same as CC-l, however
more intense development is permitted.
302.20(c) HC Highway Commercial. The uses in this district are the some as CC-l, however
larger lot areas and setbacks are required.
302.30 Industrial Districts
The Industrial Districts are designed to allow space for existing and new development to support the
City's economic life. Development within these zones is expected to be of a quality that will be
compatible with surrounding land use.
302.30(a) LI Light Industrial District. This district is designated to accommodate light
manufacturing, office, distribution and similar kinds of industrial activity.
302.30(b) HI Heavy Industrial District. This district is designed to accommodate all types of
manufacturing and industrial uses, including those classified as heavy industry.
14
302.40 MHP Mobile Home Park District
This Section is intended to create an environment in which the growth and development of mobile
home parks may be encouraged in relationship to surrounding areas and development of the City as a
whole.
302.60 Office Institutional Technical Districts
There are four districts under this heading. They are all intended to permit a variety of office,
institutional and technical activities within the City of Hermitage. These districts are intended to
provide space for a number of operations but to do so in a manner which minimizes any adverse
affects on nearby property.
302.61 OB Office Building District. A district which permits various types of traditional office
structures and related activities.
302.62 IN Institutional. This district is designed to furnish space for various offices and
institutional uses along with compatible activities.
302.62(a) IN-2 Institutional-2. This district is designed to furnish space for various offices and
institutional uses, as well as various forms of senior citizen housing and compatible activities.
302.62(b) IN-3 Institutional-3. This district is designed to furnish space for various offices and
institutional uses along with other compatible uses.
302.63 PTP Planned Technical Park. In this district the City of Hermitage recognizes that
significant changes are occurring within the area economy. This zone is designed to
accommodate the traditional office uses as allowed in the OB district while also permitting very
light "high tech" activities which can take place in an office park setting with minimal adverse
affect upon surrounding parcels and land uses. Although this district may front upon major
traffic routes, or have direct access to them, it will generally abut residential districts. It therefore
is the intent of this zone to be compatible with such residential areas. To achieve this
compatibility the campus/office setting has been determined as most appropriate.
302.63(a) Planned Technical Park-2 (PTP-2) Zoning District. This zone is designed to
provide a location for the development of technology related businesses and similar development
in a campus-like setting.

A. Encourage the development of a pedestrian oriented corridor that links a variety of uses through
streetscape amenities.
B. Provide use options and alternatives for existing residential properties that front onto Route 18
South.
C. Coordinate signage, building setbacks and site design standards along the City’s southern
gateway corridor, leading into the City’s central business district.
303. ANNEXED AREAS
Any territory hereafter annexed by the City of Hermitage will be automatically zoned R-1-100, until
otherwise classified by the City.
304. DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
District boundaries that are shown between the lines of streets, streams and transportation right-of-ways
shall be deemed to follow the centerline. The vacation of streets shall not affect the locations of such
district boundaries. When the Zoning Officer cannot definitely determine the location of a district
15
boundary by such centerlines, by the scale of dimensions stated on the Zoning Map, or by the fact that it
clearly coincides with a property line, he shall refuse action, and the Zoning Hearing Board, upon
appeal, shall interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the Zoning Map
and the purpose set forth in all relevant provisions of this Ordinance.
305. ZONING DISTRICT CHANGES
All approved changes to zoning districts shall be promptly recorded on the Zoning Map by the Zoning
Officer.

Hermitage Planning Commission. In granting a conditional use, the Board of Commissioners may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Ordinance and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
Special exceptions may be granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the

set forth in Section 413 of this Ordinance shall be applicable to nonresidential
developments. For multi-family developments, the standards of Section 308.42 shall
apply.
(2) Location of Parking. Off-street parking areas shall not be located between the
principal building(s) and Route 18 South. The City may waive or reduce this
requirement for conversions of existing buildings where the lot dimensions and
location of the existing building preclude compliance. Such waiver or reduction shall
be the minimum possible in keeping with the goals and intentions of the Overlay
District.

from centerline to centerline. Shared driveways between parcels shall be used
where necessary to meet this requirement. The City may reduce this requirement,
only where it has been demonstrated that all possible avenues for compliance have
been fully explored, but the specific conditions of the proposed development will
not allow the minimum spacing to be accomplished, or other traffic safety
considerations take precedence. The maximum spacing possible will still be
required. Where two or more adjacent property owners agree to combine driveway
access points, the City may grant 15% reduction in required parking spacing for
each use.
(b) Wherever possible, driveways should have direct alignment with driveways or
roads on the opposite side of the highway or street.
(6) Interconnection of Off-Street Parking Areas. As one measure to reduce traffic
congestion and improve safety along the Route 18 South corridor, parking areas shall
be connected to adjacent parcels through rear or side yard access drives. The City may

309. PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
Purpose. The purpose of the planned residential development regulations is to encourage the
flexibility in the design and development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to
encourage grouping of housing and a mixture of housing types in alternative patterns and in a
variety of ways; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; and to
preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open areas. Planned residential developments are
permitted in the R-l, R-2 and R-3 Districts.
309.1 Minimum Development Size
No planned residential development may include less than ten acres of contiguous land.
309.2 General Standards
The planned residential development must meet all of the following general standards:
(a) The planned residential development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and this
Ordinance's Statement of Community Development Objectives.
(b) The planned residential development is an effective and unified treatment of the
development possibilities on the project site, and the development plan makes appropriate
provision for the preservation of streams and stream banks, wooded cover, rough terrain,
and similar areas.
(c) The planned residential development shall be planned and developed to harmonize with
any existing or proposed development in the area surrounding the project site.
51

Districts and may include the following additional uses: multi-family dwellings in accordance
with the requirements of Section 308.42, community clubs and related uses. Such uses shall be
allowed only to the extent that the City finds them to be (1) designed to serve primarily the
residents of the planned residential development, and (2) compatibly and harmoniously
incorporated into the design of the planned development. (Mobile homes and mobile home
parks are excluded from the planned residential development district. Please see the Mobile
Home Park [MHP] District for details relative to that use).
309.4 Calculation of Project Densities
The number of dwelling units which may be constructed within the planned residential
development shall be determined by dividing the gross project area by the required lot area per
dwelling unit which is required in the district in which the planned residential development is
located.
309.5 Increase in Density
It is recognized that the expense of complying with the approval process contained in the
planned residential development regulations may discourage developers from seeking approval
of a planned residential development project. At the time the outline or preliminary
development plan is filed, the applicant may apply for an increase in the densities permitted by
the zone in which the planned residential development is to be constructed. If it gives its
approval to the planned residential development, the Board of Commissioners may authorize
the developer to increase permitted densities by an amount up to 10%.
Additional increase in density may be granted up to 27% providing:
(a) If common open space is developed to more intense usable open space providing facilities
for active outdoor recreation, such as playgrounds, playground equipment, picnic
facilities, ball fields and equipment, or other similar improvements to the open space, an
additional 10% increase in density may be permitted.
(b) If subsection (a), above, is developed and unique indoor-outdoor buildings, to be used for
recreation or other similar activities of the residents of the development, such as
swimming pools, club houses, or other similar buildings are provided, then an additional
17% increase in density may be permitted.
309.6 Lot Size and Spacing of Buildings
The location of all structures shall be as shown on final plans. The proposed location and
arrangement shall not be detrimental to existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the
existing or prospective development of the neighborhood. There shall be no minimum lot size,
no minimum or maximum percentage of lot coverage and no minimum lot width in the
planned residential development. However, every single-family dwelling shall have access to a
public street, court, walkway, or other area dedicated to public use. The minimum space
between two multi-family buildings or between a multi-family building and any other building
on the same property shall be 16 feet for 1 story or 1.5 story buildings, 24 feet for 2 story
buildings and 32 feet for 3 story buildings. Minimum distance between two buildings of

309.7 Perimeter Requirements
The requirements of this Section apply only to structures located within 200 feet of the
perimeter of a planned residential development. If topographical or other barriers do not
provide adequate privacy for existing uses adjacent to the planned residential development, the
Planning Commission may require either or both of the following:
(a) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential development must be set
back by a distance sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses,
in no case less than the height of the buildings.
(b) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential development must be
permanently screened in a manner which is sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity
of adjacent existing uses.

this Ordinance.
No open area may be accepted as common open space under the provisions of this Ordinance
unless it meets the following standards:
(a) A minimum of three acres of common open space shall be provided including usable and
scenic green space for the first ten acres plus one acre for each additional five acres or
fraction thereof of gross project area.
(b) The location, shape, size, and character of the common open space must be suitable for
the planned residential development.
(c) Common open space must be used for amenity or recreational purposes. The uses

common open space of a value in excess of $1,000, the developer must provide a bond in
the estimated amount of the improvements assuring that the buildings, structures and
improvements will be completed. The Commissioners shall release the bond or other
assurance when the buildings, structures or improvements have been completed according
to the development plan.
309.9 Conveyance and Maintenance of Common Space
All land shown on the final development plan as common open space must be conveyed under
one of the following options:
(a) It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to maintain the common open
space and any buildings, structures or improvements which have been placed on it, in
which case the general public must have use of the open space.
(b) It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture establishing an association or
similar organization for the maintenance of the planned residential development. The
common open space must be conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants to be approved
by the City which restricts the common open space to the uses specified on the final
development plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the common open space in a
manner which assures its containing use for its intended purpose.
(1) No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the final development
plan unless the final development plan has been amended to permit that use.
However, no change of use authorized under Section 309 may be considered as a
waiver of any of the covenants limiting the use of common open space areas, and all
rights to enforce these covenants against any use permitted are expressly reserved.
(2) If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, either one of the
following methods of enforcement must be provided:
(a) The legal right to develop the common open space for the uses not specified in the
final development plan must be approved by the City.
(b) The restrictions governing the use, improvement and maintenance of the common
open space must be stated as conditions to the conveyance of the common open
space, the fee title to the common open space to vest in a public agency in the

days, from the date of filing, to complete their review and make their recommendations to
the City’s Board of Commissioners.
309.11 Public Hearings
(1) Within 60 days after the filing of an application for tentative approval of a planned
residential development pursuant to this Ordinance, a public hearing pursuant to public
notice of said application shall be held by the City of Hermitage in the manner prescribed
in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(2) The Board of Commissioners may continue the hearing from time to time, and where
applicable, may refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for additional review;
provided, however, that in any event, the public hearing or hearings shall be concluded
within 60 days after the date of the first public hearing.
309.12 The Findings
(1) The Board of Commissioners, within 60 days following the conclusion of the public
hearing provided for in this Part, shall, by official written communication to the
landowner, either:
(a) Grant tentative approval of the development plan as submitted;
(b) Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not included in the
development plan as submitted; or,
(c) Deny tentative approval to the development plan.
Failure to so act within said period shall be deemed to be a grant of tentative approval of
the development plan as submitted. In the event, however, that tentative approval is
granted subject to conditions, the landowner may, within 30 days after receiving a copy of
the official written communication of the City, notify such Board of Commissioners of his
refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case, the City shall be deemed to have denied
tentative approval of the development plan. In the event the landowner does not, within
said period, notify the Board of Commissioners of his refusal to accept all said conditions,
tentative approval of the development plan, with all said conditions, shall stand as granted.
(2) The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written communication shall include
not only conclusions but also findings of fact related to the specific proposal and set forth
the reasons for the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said
communication shall set forth with particularity in what respects the development plan
would or would not be in the public interest, including, but not limited to, findings of fact
and conclusions on the following:
(a) In those respects in which the development plan is or is not consistent with the
comprehensive plan for the development of the City of Hermitage;
(b) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and subdivision
regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property including, but not limited to,
density, bulk and use, and the reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be
in the public interest;
(c) The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the planned residential
development, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the
56
common open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the
common open space as related to the proposed density and type of residential
development;
(d) The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which said design does
or does not make adequate provision for public services, provide adequate control over
vehicular traffic, and further the amenities of light and air, recreation, and visual
enjoyment;
(e) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned residential
development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established; and,
(f) In the case of a development plan which proposes development over a period of years,
the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the interests of the
public and of the residents of the planned residential development in the integrity of the
development plan.
(3) In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or without conditions,
the City may set forth in the official written communication the time within which an
application for final approval of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a
development plan which provides for development over a period of years, the periods of
time within which applications for final approval of each part thereof shall be filed. Except
upon the consent of the landowner, the time so established between grant of tentative
approval and an application for final approval shall not be less than 12 months and, in the
case of developments over a period of years, the time between applications for final
approval of each part of a plan shall be not less than 12 months.
309.13 Status of Plan After Tentative Approval
(1) The official written communication provided for in this Part shall be certified by the
municipal secretary of the City Commissioners and shall be filed in his office, and a
certified copy shall be mailed to the landowner. Where tentative approval has been
granted, it shall be deemed an amendment to the Zoning Map, effective upon final
approval, and shall be noted on the Zoning Map.
(2) Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of the planned residential
development for recording nor authorize development or the issuance of any building
permits. A development plan which has been given tentative approval as submitted, or
which has been given tentative approval with conditions which have been accepted by the
landowner (and provided that the landowner has not defaulted nor violated any of the
conditions of the tentative approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise
impaired by action of the City pending an application or applications for final approval,
without the consent of the landowner, provided an application or applications for final
approval is filed or, in the case of development over a period of years, provided
applications are filed, within the period of time specified in the official written
communication granting tentative approval.
(3) In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval and thereafter, but prior to
final approval, the landowner shall elect to abandon said development plan and shall so
notify the Board of Commissioners in writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to
file application or applications for final approval within the required period of time or
times, as the case may be, the tentative approval shall be deemed to be revoked and all that
portion of the area included in the development plan for which final approval has not been
given shall be subject to those local ordinances otherwise applicable thereto as they may be
57
amended from time to time, and the same shall be noted on the Zoning Map and in the
records of the municipal secretary of the City.
309.14 Application for Final Approval
(1) An application for final approval may be for all the land included in a development plan or,
to the extent set forth in the tentative approval, for a section thereof. Said application shall
be made to the Zoning Officer of the City designated by this Ordinance within one year of
the official written communication granting tentative approval. The application shall
include any drawings, specifications, covenants, easements, performance bond and such
other requirements as may be specified by this Ordinance, as well as any conditions set
forth in the official written communication at the time of tentative approval. A public
hearing on an application for final approval of the development plan, or the part thereof,
submitted for final approval, shall not be required provided the development plan, or the
part thereof submitted for final approval is in compliance with the development plan
theretofore given tentative approval and with any specified conditions attached thereto.
The submission shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer and the Planning Commission for
compliance prior to being forwarded to the Board of Commissioners. This review is to take
place in 35 days.
(2) In the event the application for final approval has been filed, together with all drawings,
specifications and other documents in support thereof, and as required by this Ordinance
and the official written communication of tentative approval, the City shall, within 45 days
of such filing, grant such development plan final approval.
(3) In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations from the development
plan given tentative approval, the City may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within
45 days from the filing of the application for final approval, so advise the landowner in
writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons why one or more of said
variations are not in the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the landowner may
either:
(a) Refile his application for final approval without the variations objected; or
(b) File a written request with the approving body that it hold a public hearing on his
application for final approval.
If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action he may do so at any time within
which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval, or within 30 additional days if the
time for applying for final approval shall have already passed at the time when the
landowner was advised that the development plan was not in substantial compliance. In the
event the landowner shall fail to take either of these alternative actions within said time, he
shall be deemed to have abandoned the development plan. Any such public hearing shall
be held pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for the hearing is made by the
landowner, and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in this Part for
public hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within thirty 30 days after the
conclusion of the hearing, the City shall by official written communication either grant
final approval to the development plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial of final
approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising under this Section, be in the form
and contain the findings required for an application for tentative approval set forth in this
Ordinance.
(4) A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final approval shall be so
certified without delay by the City and shall be filed of record forthwith in the office of the
recorder of deeds before any development shall take place in accordance therewith. Upon
58
the filing of record of the development plan the zoning and subdivision regulations
otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto. Pending
completion, in accordance with the time provisions stated in Section 508 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, of said planned residential development or of
that part thereof, as the case may be, that has been finally approved, no modification of the
provisions of said development plan, or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made
except with the consent of the landowner. Upon approval of a final plat, the developer shall
record the plat in accordance with the provisions of Section 513(a) and post financial
security in accordance with Section 509 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(5) In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given final approval and
thereafter the landowner shall abandon such plan or the section thereof that has been
finally approved, and shall so notify the City in writing; or, in the event the landowner
shall fail to commence and carry out the planned residential development in accordance
with the time provisions stated in Section 508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code after final approval has been granted, no development or further development shall
take place on the property included in the development plan until after the said property is
reclassified by enactment of an amendment to this Ordinance in the manner prescribed for
such amendments in Part 7.

PART 4
SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS
401. NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses and structures. It is the intention
of the City of Hermitage that all legal nonconforming uses and structures shall be able to
continue; however, all changes in such uses shall only be as allowed in this Part.
401.10 Any nonconforming use may be continued, or may be changed to a use of the same or a
more restrictive classification, but may not be extended or expanded unless to a conforming use,
except as permitted by the Board in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
401.20 Any nonconforming building which has been damaged or destroyed by fire or any other
means may be reconstructed and used as before, if such reconstruction is commenced within one
year of discontinuance of use and completed within a year from that date and if the restored
building covers no greater area and contains no greater cubic content. If approved by the Board, a
reconstructed structure may exceed its original lot coverage and cubic content (see also 401.40)
but must meet the minimum yard requirements of the district in which the structure is located, and
it must meet the off-street parking and loading requirements of this Ordinance.
401.30 In the event that any nonconforming use, conducted in a structure or otherwise, ceases, for
whatever reason, for a period of one year, such nonconforming use shall not be resumed and any
further use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
401.40 The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout those parts thereof
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption of this
Ordinance. A nonconforming use may, with the approval of the Board, be extended, enlarged or
replaced, including upon adjacent vacant lands, if such expansion does not occupy an area greater
than one hundred (100%) percent more than the structure was approved to occupy prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance (September 30, 2004). Furthermore, such activities must meet the
minimum yard regulations and height restrictions of the district in which the structure is located,
and must meet all off-street parking and loading requirements of this Ordinance.
401.40(a) In determining whether such expansion, enlargement or reconstruction shall be
approved, the Board shall consider the impact on the surrounding neighborhood, including
traffic impacts, noise, light, privacy and visual appearance, and in the event of expansion onto
adjacent vacant land, the Board shall also consider whether the owner has exhausted the
alternatives for expansion on the existing property.
401.40(b) Expansion of nonconforming uses in any zoning district shall provide a Buffer
Yard in compliance with Section 413.5(b) of the Hermitage Zoning Ordinance.
401.41 Any building or structure lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance
or amendment thereto which does not meet the applicable front, side or rear yard requirements of
the district in which it is located may be expanded or extended provided such expansion does not
result in a lesser setback than that of the existing building or structure, and provided that the
length of the expansion does not exceed the length of the portion of the existing building which is
nonconforming.
401.50 Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall layout, plans,
construction, size or designated use of any development, building, structure or part thereof for
which official approval and required permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance and where construction is complete within 6 months from the date of issuance of the
permit.
76
401.60 Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be permitted to revert to a
nonconforming use.
401.70 Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer an area from one
district to another of a different classification, this Part shall also apply to any uses which thereby
become nonconforming.
402. EXISTING LOTS OF RECORD
Any lot of record existing at the effective date of this Ordinance, and held in separate ownership
different from the ownership of adjoining lots, may be used for the erection of a structure
conforming to the use regulations of the district in which it is located even though its lot area and
width are less than the minimum required by this Ordinance, however, such lot must comply with
the yard, height and coverage standards of the zoning district wherein it is located. Where two or
more adjacent lots of record with less than the required area and width are held by one owner, on
or before the date of enactment of this Ordinance, the request for a permit shall be referred to the
Zoning Hearing Board which may require replatting to fewer lots, which would comply with the
minimum requirements of this Ordinance.
403. APPLICATION OF YARD REGULATIONS
403.1 All structures, whether attached to the principal structure or not, and whether open or
enclosed, including porches, carports, balconies or platforms above normal grade level, shall not
project into any minimum front, side or rear yards except as noted in Sections 403.3 and 401.41.
403.2A wall or fence under 6 feet in height and paved terraces without walls, roofs or other
enclosures may be erected within the limits of any yard. Retaining walls, buffer strips and fences
required for screening under this Ordinance are not subject to the 6 foot high limitation.
Fences required for recreational facilities such as tennis courts and baseball fields may be higher
than 6 feet; provided, that they are constructed of open type fencing material, such as chain link.
No fence shall be permitted which obstructs a sight triangle measured 30 feet along the edge of
any roadway and 30 feet along the edge of any intersecting roadway and/or driveway. The sight
triangle must be free of obstruction by any fence higher than 3 feet. No fence shall be constructed
within the legal right-of-way of any public street.
403.3 Swimming pools shall be permitted in rear and side yards only; provided, that the pool is
located not less than 10 feet from any side yard line, and 10 feet from the rear yard line. (See also
Section 411.)
404. TEMPORARY STRUCTURES
Temporary structures in conjunction with construction work shall be permitted only during the
period that the construction work is in progress. Permits for temporary structures shall be issued
for a 6 month period.

The following structures are exempt from height regulations provided they do not constitute a
hazard: communication towers, church spires, chimneys, elevator bulk heads, smoke stacks,
conveyors, flag poles, agricultural silos, stand pipes, elevated water tanks, derricks and similar
structures.
However, for the above structures, all yard and set-back requirements must be met; in addition,

dead ends are to be avoided in design. A smooth flowing loop circulation is preferred.
(c) Clearly marked pedestrian ways from parking areas to building.
(d) Identification of special features, bikeways, etc.
In its review of the parking lot design for adequacy, the Board will use professional
engineers and such design sources as provided by the Institute of Traffic Engineers and the
American Planning Association.
408.2(i) Traffic Impact Analysis. For office structures of 40,000 square feet of gross
leasable area or more. Or for other designated developments which will introduce large
volumes of traffic onto the roads and highways of Hermitage a Traffic Impact Analysis will
82
be required. The developer, and developer’s engineer/planner may use any reasonable
professional approach to complete this analysis; however, it must answer the following
questions:
(a) Existing traffic/transportation conditions including street size, street capacity, nearby
signalization, current and anticipated traffic volumes.
(b) Estimated parking on site, future trip generation and peak hour volumes.
(c) The effect of the onsite trip generation, at peak hour volumes, upon the surrounding

ordinance.
413. LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL USES
413.1 Administration
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to define the landscape requirements for
nonresidential uses in order to:
(1) Provide a quality environment throughout the business and industrial areas, which
includes requirements for plantings in new and reuse developments to provide shade,
beauty and environmental benefits (air quality, absorption of stormwater, prevention of
soil erosion, etc.) to the community.
(2) Improve the appearance and desirability of the business and industrial areas, to enhance
property values and to promote economic development and reinvestment in the
community.
(3) Better define and control traffic patterns within parking areas and along streets, thus
increasing safety. Curbing, trees, plantings and similar measures serve to delineate
travel lanes from parking area and to provide a traffic calming effect in slowing traffic
both on and off public streets.
(4) Design improved and safer access within and between properties for pedestrians.
(5) Provide effective noise, pollution and visual privacy buffers for residential properties
adjacent to business or industrial developments.
(b) Plan Submission and Approval.
(1) Any property subject to land development for a nonresidential development or use,
except in an R-1 Zoning District, shall be required to comply with the landscaping
requirements of Section 413, and to include a landscape plan as part of the land
development plan for the subject property. Where any other section of this Ordinance
or any other City ordinance is in conflict with the requirements of Section 413, the
more stringent requirements shall apply.
(2) Such landscaping plans shall be drawn to a scale which permits proper legibility and
sufficient detail, and shall clearly delineate all existing and proposed parking spaces or
other vehicle areas, access drives, driveways and the location size and description of all
landscaping materials and tree cover as required. Typical elevations of all walls
pertaining to Sections 413.2.c “Building Perimeter Landscaping” and 413.5 “Buffer
Yard and Screening” are required. Data tables must be shown for required building
perimeter landscaping, detention pond perimeter landscaping and buffer landscaping in
accordance with City standards. Title block must be shown with pertinent names and
addresses; property owner; name, address and telephone number of person who
completed the plan; scale, date and north arrow. In addition, existing natural features
must be shown on the plan and should be incorporated into the overall site design,
where practical.
(c) Certificate of Occupancy. Where landscaping is required, no certificate of occupancy
shall be issued until the landscaping is completed as certified by inspection by the City of
Hermitage, unless a performance bond in an amount acceptable to the City has been posted
to guarantee the completion of all elements of the landscape plan.
89
(d) Completion of Landscape Improvements after Posting of Performance Bond. After a
performance bond has been posted, all elements of the approved landscape plan shall be
installed within 6 months after the date of posting of the bond. An extension of the time for
completion may be granted by the City upon demonstration by the property owner or
developer that such an extension is warranted due to such reasons as adverse weather
conditions or unavailability of plants materials. Substitutions of similar plant material may
be approved by the City.
(e) Maintenance and Installation. All landscaping materials shall be installed in a sound,
workmanship-like manner and according to accepted, good construction and planting
procedures. Plant materials shall conform to the requirements described in the latest edition
of American Standards for Nursery Stock, which is published by the American Association
of Nurserymen. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued proper
maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly
appearance, free from refuse and debris at all times. All unhealthy or dead plant material
shall be replaced within 1 year, or by the next planting period, whichever comes first;
while other defective landscape material shall be replaced or repaired within 3 months.
Plants shall not be pruned or thinned in such a way as to minimize their effectiveness as a
visual barrier, where that is their function as in a buffer yard.
Landscaped areas shall not be used for storage of vehicles, equipment or materials or for
any other use incompatible with their purpose as contemplated by this Section.
Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the City to
refuse a certificate of occupancy and/or institution of legal enforcement proceedings.
413.2 General Site Landscaping
(a) Curbing. For major land developments, all new parking areas and access drives shall be
curbed. For minor land developments, all access drives from the public street into the
parking area shall be curbed, and any other location where curbing is necessary to protect
pedestrians or plant materials. Curbing is not required on the perimeter of existing parking
areas, or where not possible due to grade constraints. Curbing is not required for industrial
land developments.
(b) Landscaped areas shall not be required in any location where it would interfere with the
vehicle sight distance or safety as determined by the City.
(c) Building Perimeter Landscaping. Where any building wall is transparent between the
height of 3 feet and 8 feet above the walkway grade for 60% or more of the horizontal
length of the structure, building perimeter landscaping may be provided at the discretion of
the property owner, except that adequate walkways, separated from driveways and parking
areas by curbing shall be required along the building perimeter where pedestrian traffic can
be reasonably expected. Where a building wall or walls contain no such transparency or
entrance doorway for a horizontal distance of more than 30 feet, building perimeter
landscaping is required in the form of plant material which will cover no less than 50% of
the wall face, of which 50% will reach a mature height of no less than 75% of the building
wall height. No less than 50% of this plant material will be required to be of evergreen
varieties in accordance with City standards. Where exceptional architectural articulation,
such as recesses, projections or decorative detailing is provided, the City may reduce (but
not eliminate) the building perimeter landscaping for those portions of the building exterior.
Building perimeter landscaping is required for major land developments, but not for minor
or industrial land developments.
90
(d) Landscape Material Specifications. All materials shall meet the following minimum
standards:
Plant Material Type Minimum Size
Canopy tree (35 feet minimum mature height) 1.5-2 inch caliper (at chest height)
Ornamental tree 1-1.5 inch caliper
Evergreen tree 6 feet height (not including leader)
Shrub (40 inch minimum mature height) 24 inch height
Perennial (includes ornamental grass) 1 gallon
(1) All trees and shrubs shall be balled and burlapped or container grown. If plants are
container grown and are root bound, the roots should be cut or slashed at the time of
planting.
(2) Mulch shall be shredded hardwood bark mulch, unless an acceptable alternative is
approved by the City.
(e) Preservation of Existing Vegetation. Preservation of existing trees is strongly
encouraged. Existing trees that meet the minimum size and location requirements of this
Section will be given double credit (one preserved tree = two new trees) toward the
satisfaction of planting requirements, provided that the area within the dripline of the trees
is protected by fencing during grading and construction. This credit can be applied to
requirements in Sections 413.2, 413.4 and 413.5 as approved by the City.
(f) Detention Pond Perimeter Landscape Requirements. The perimeter of above ground
stormwater detention or retention ponds shall be landscaped to enhance the appearance of
the pond, with the minimum number of plants to be as follows:
One tree (canopy or ornamental) per 50 lineal feet of pond perimeter, plus one shrub for
every 5 lineal feet of pond perimeter. For purposes of this subsection, a shrub can be one
shrub, one ornamental grass and/or one group of three perennials.
The plantings shall be grouped and clustered around the pond within 20 feet of the
perimeter so as to provide maximum visual screening from public areas, and to permit
access for maintenance purposes.
Detention pond perimeter landscaping is required for all residential and nonresidential land
developments, except industrial land developments.
413.3 Street Frontage, Greenways and Access Drives
(a) Where a property abuts a public street, private street or access drives, a greenway shall be
provided, except for entrances for pedestrians and vehicles. This greenway shall include a
sidewalk of a minimum width of 5 feet connecting to the lot line of adjacent parcels and
constructed in accordance with City standards, except that in the Heavy and Light
Industrial Zoning Districts an easement for future sidewalk may be substituted for
sidewalk construction as determined to be appropriate by the City.
The greenway shall also contain street trees planted no greater than 30 feet on center. The
location of street trees and sidewalks relative to the street edge shall be in accordance with
the City’s recommended standards for each type of street, with exact locations to be as
determined by the City, and PennDOT where applicable, based on the conditions of each
site. The preferred location for street trees shall be between the sidewalk and roadway, but
they may be behind the sidewalk where determined to be necessary due to traffic safety
91
needs and/or utility locations. Canopy trees are preferred for street trees and location
adjustments is the first alternative where canopy trees will interfere with overhead utility
lines. Where no other alternative is possible, ornamental trees (based on the appropriate
utility company recommendations) may be substituted for canopy trees.
The minimum width of the greenway shall be 25 feet, measured from the curb or edge of
pavement of the public street(s) abutting the property. The greenway may contain
landscaping, lawn, sidewalk and utilities only and shall not contain any vehicular or other
use, with the exception of entrance drives crossing the greenway. Where a site with existing
development is subject to a land development plan due to a renovation or addition to
existing building(s) and the greenway requirement will cause reduction in the number of
existing parking spaces such that the minimum parking requirement of the zoning ordinance
cannot be met, the Hermitage Planning Commission may authorize a reduction in the
greenway width to the least extent possible to preserve the minimum required parking
spaces.
This subsection shall apply to all major, minor and industrial land developments.
(b) Main access drives to and from public streets shall be separated from other portions of the
parking lot by curbed landscaped areas of not less than 10 feet in width, provided along
both sides of the entire access drive, except for entrances for pedestrians or vehicles. These
landscaped areas must accommodate a 5 foot sidewalk with a 5 foot landscaped area
bounded by and separated from the parking area by curbing, except where the sidewalk
must cross vehicle travel lanes, where the layouts shall be such that the length of such
crossing is made as small as possible, and such crosswalks shall be delineated with
textured surfaces (excluding paint) which serve to call attention of motorists to their
presence. The landscaped area shall contain canopy trees (or ornamental trees where there
is a conflict with above ground utility lines) planted no less than 30 feet on center.
This subsection shall apply to all major and minor land developments. It shall not apply to
industrial land developments.
413.4 Screening and Landscaping of Off-Street Parking Areas
To the greatest extent possible, off-street parking areas shall be designed to reduce the
negative visual effect of vast paved areas and shall contain landscaped planting islands and
defined landscaped pedestrian walkways. This Section provides requirements for internal
parking area landscaping, as well as landscaping along the perimeter of the parking area.
(a) Parking Area Design.
(1) Clearly defined and marked sidewalks shall be required within parking areas and be
provided for the length of the parking area to the entrances of establishments. Such
walkway areas shall be a minimum of 10 feet in width to accommodate a sidewalk with
an unobstructed width of 5 feet and a 5 foot wide landscaped area bounded by and
separated from the parking area by curbing. Where the sidewalk must cross vehicle
travel lanes, the layout shall be such that the width of such crossing is made as small as
possible, and such crosswalks shall be delineated with textured surfaces (excluding
paint) which serve to call attention of motorists to their presence. The requirements of
this Section may be met with the application of a main aisle upon approval of the City.
This subsection shall apply to major land developments only.
(2) In parking areas of greater than 400 spaces, main aisles to and from access drives shall
be separated from other portions of the parking lot by curbed and landscaped walkway
areas of not less than 10 feet in width, provided along the entire access drive. The main
92
aisle shall be separated by 200 feet by vehicular travel lanes running perpendicular to
the drive and bounded at the ends with terminal islands. Clearly defined and marked
sidewalks shall be required on both sides for the length of the main aisle to the
entrances of establishments. Such walkway areas shall contain a sidewalk with an
unobstructed width of 5 feet and a landscaped area with a minimum width of 5 feet
with canopy trees planted 30 feet on center. The sidewalk and landscaped area shall be
separated from the parking area by curbing, except where the sidewalk must cross
vehicle travel lanes, where the layout shall be such that the length of such crossing is
made as small as possible, and such crosswalks shall be delineated with textured
surfaces (excluding paint) which serve to call attention of motorists to their presence.
This subsection shall apply to major land developments only.
(3) Landscaped divider strips shall be a minimum 6 feet in width for the length of the
parking row and shall be placed a minimum of every third row for the total of adjoining
parking to prevent traffic movement across parking aisles. One canopy tree shall be
required for every 20 parking spaces and shall be located within the landscaped divider
strips. These trees shall not be included in requirements for any other section of this
Ordinance.
This subsection shall apply to major land developments only.
(4) Terminal islands shall be installed at both ends of each single unbroken row of parking.
The maximum length of an unbroken row of parking shall be 20 parking spaces,
separated by vehicular travel lanes running perpendicular. Vehicular travel lanes are not
required for perimeter parking. Terminal islands shall be a minimum of 15 feet in length
with one canopy tree (for single loaded parking) or 30 feet in length with two canopy
trees (for double loaded parking) and shall have a minimum width of 10 feet.
This subsection shall apply to major land developments only.
(5) Interconnection of Off-Street Parking Areas. To reduce traffic congestion and the
number of curb cuts along public streets, parking areas shall be connected to adjacent
parcels through a rear or side yard access drive constructed parallel to the public street
to which the use fronts or is located along. The intent is to provide a secondary point of
access in a grid pattern. Access drives shall be constructed in accordance with City
standards. Where a parking area is constructed and is adjacent to an undeveloped lot,
the access drive, where feasible, shall be extended to the lot line for future connection to
the adjacent parcel.
This subsection shall apply to major and minor land developments.
(b) Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping.
(1) Where a parking area borders a public right-of-way, a continuous hedgerow or
ornamental metal fencing with brick pillars in accordance with City standards, or a
combination thereof is required. This is in addition to the street frontage and greenway
requirement of Section 413.3. The hedgerow shall consist of one shrub per every 3
linear feet. The maximum height of a hedgerow shall be 3.5 feet at maturity. The fence
height may be varied between a minimum of 3.5 feet in height and a maximum of 4
feet in height.
This subsection shall apply to major land developments only.
(2) Where a parking area borders an abutting property line, a landscaped strip with a
minimum width of 6 feet shall be located between the parking area and the property
line, except where driveways or other access points occur. At least one canopy tree
93
shall be planted every 60 feet in the landscaped strip and a continuous hedgerow
consisting of one shrub per every 3 linear feet, with a maximum height of 3.5 feet at
maturity shall be provided.
This subsection shall apply to major land developments only.
(3) Where perimeter landscaping required by this Section conflicts with the buffer yard
requirements, the more stringent requirements shall apply.
(4) Planting required in this Section cannot be substituted for any of the planting required
in subsections 413.2, 413.3 or 413.5.
413.5 Buffer Yard and Screening Requirements
The purpose of this Section is to set standards to buffer or screen incompatible uses in order to
minimize negative impacts on neighboring properties.
(a) Buffer Yard Requirements. Where any major, minor or industrial nonresidential
development borders a residential zoning district or use, or a public or private school or a
church, buffer yard option A or B shall be required along the entire length of all abutting
property lines. The buffer yard shall not be required within the future right-of-way of any
street or in any location where it would interfere with the greenway and/or vehicle sight
distance or safety.
(b) Buffer Yard Options.
Buffer Yard Option A. A 50 foot wide strip containing the following minimum planting
specifications per each 100 feet of buffer yard length:
Three canopy trees + six ornamental trees + 20 evergreen trees (= 29 trees total) per
100 feet of buffer yard length.
Buffer Yard Option B. A 20 foot wide strip containing a masonry wall in accordance
with City standards, of a minimum height of 6 feet or a solid evergreen hedge with a
minimum height at time of planting of 6 feet located along the property line, plus the
following plantings within the remainder of the 20 foot wide strip:
Three canopy trees + six ornamental trees + five evergreen trees (= 14 trees total) per
100 feet of buffer yard length.
(c) Screening Requirements.
(1) Loading Docks and Trash Collection Enclosures. Loading docks, trash collection
area enclosures and similar facilities shall be incorporated into the overall design of
buildings and the landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions
are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets. These
facilities shall be screened by a solid masonry, vinyl or wood wall at least 6 feet in
height and of adequate strength of construction to retain the original structural
integrity. Such enclosures shall be maintained as necessary to remain in a state of
proper repair and positive appearance. Failure to properly maintain or repair enclosures
as needed shall constitute a violation of this Section of the zoning ordinance. These
facilities must meet all requirements as per Section 413.2, “Building Perimeter
Landscaping.”
(2) Building Mechanical Systems. All building mechanical systems such as air condition
units, exhaust systems, satellite dishes, fire escapes, elevator housing and other similar
elements shall be incorporated into the overall design and character of the building and
screened from view. Wherever feasible, the use of exterior mechanical systems should
94
be minimized. Landscaping and other screening devices including decorative fencing
shall be used to soften the view of these features from adjoining properties or public
streets.
(3) Outdoor Storage Facilities. Storage facilities for goods or materials that are kept on
premises for retail sale, wholesale, storage or use shall be permitted as an accessory use
and must be attached to a principal building. Storage facilities must be screened from
view and constructed of a material which maintains 100% opacity and be no higher
than the building to which they are attached. Storage facilities shall meet all
requirements as per Section 413.2.c, “Building Perimeter Landscaping”, if directly
abutting a public street, private street, access drive or greenway or as determined by the
City.
414. REFUSE CONTAINERS
The following regulations shall apply to all uses in all districts except single family dwellings,
two family dwellings, and multifamily dwellings where four or less dwelling units represent the
total development. Refuse containers shall not be permitted between any building and any public
street with the preferred location being directly adjacent to the main structure. Trash collection
and similar facilities shall be completely enclosed by a solid wall at least 6 feet in height.
Enclosures shall be constructed of the same material or be architecturally compatible with the
principal structure and shall maintain 100% opacity on all three sides with a self-closing gate on
the fourth side. Trash collection areas shall be located on rigid pavement surfaces and designed to
prevent accumulation of stormwater runoff.
415. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES, RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
Accessory structures in all residential districts must be located behind the front line of the
principal uses. The total building area of all accessory buildings (except residential garages) must
not exceed 2% of the total lot area. In no event can the size of all structures on a lot exceed the
allowable lot coverage as set forth by this Ordinance. (see also Table 307.10). Maximum
building height for accessory buildings on lots of 5 acres or more is 30 feet; provided, the
building is located at least 50 feet from any adjoining property line. Maximum building height for
barns and other agricultural buildings on parcels of 20 acres or more is 40 feet; provided, the
building is located at least 100 feet from any adjoining property line, and at least 75 feet from the
future right-of-way of any adjacent street.
416. TEMPORARY STORAGE FACILITIES
The use of trucks, truck trailers or similar devices for storage purposes shall only be permitted
temporarily on construction sites during the actual building of a development.
417. AGRICULTURE
Horse stables and the raising of livestock such as cattle, pigs and chickens shall be subject to the
following restrictions:
(a) Stables, barns and other buildings used to house horses and/or livestock shall be located at
least 100 feet from an adjacent property line. In addition, such buildings shall be located at
least 200 feet from any existing home, other than a home on the same property.
(b) Horse stables and the raising of livestock must be located on a lot with an area of two acres or
more, and with a lot width of at least 250 feet.
(c) All boarding of animals upon the premises shall be within enclosed buildings; however, the
use of runways and pastures is permitted.
95
418. OFFICE/COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AND COMPLEXES
The intense use of commercial lots for various commercial and office uses represents a wise use
of the land, yet may cause considerable impact upon surrounding uses, the infrastructure, and the
Hermitage road system. Where the floor area of such uses exceed 30,000 square feet in size, the
following shall be required:
(a) If building height exceeds 60 feet, the building design must show how fire safety concerns
will be met, and that water pressure will be sufficient to meet approved sprinkler and/or stand
pipe requirements. Evidence of compliance with State Labor and Industry standards and
Hermitage fire regulations will be required.
(b) A parking lot design shall be provided to show the parking lot layout in relationship to the
building. Please see Section 408.2 for guidance in submitting the parking lot plan.
(c) A traffic impact analysis shall be required for buildings, building complexes which contain
over 40,000 square feet of gross leasable area. Please see Section 408.2(i) for guidance in the
submission of a traffic impact analysis.
(d) For building heights in excess of 60 feet, a 1 foot increase in all yard requirements for each
additional 1 foot in height will be required. Furthermore, the developer will be required to
present a model or other graphic device to show the shadow patterns of the proposed building
and how it will affect surrounding developments. For the purpose of this study, an assumed
latitude of N 42E may be used.
96
PART 5
ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT AND APPEALS
501. ZONING OFFICER
The City of Hermitage shall appoint the Zoning Officer who shall administer and enforce the
provisions of this Ordinance, and shall do so in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance
and of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The Zoning Officer shall not hold any
elective office in the City.
502. DUTIES OF THE ZONING OFFICER
The Zoning Officer shall administer this Ordinance in accordance with its literal terms, and shall
not have the power to permit any construction or any use or change of use which does not

duties by meeting the qualifications established by the City. In addition, the Zoning Officer’s
duties, obligations and responsibilities include the following:

The Zoning Officer shall receive applications for building permits. A building permit is an
application filed prior to the start of construction/development by a developer to describe the
proposed activity in sufficient detail to determine whether or not it meets the requirements of
this and other applicable City ordinances. Applications conforming to such ordinances shall
be approved, those not conforming to such ordinances shall be denied.
Applications for single developments, either of an individual building or a complex, with an
estimated cost of $1,000,000 or more, will be required to submit a scale model. This model
will include buildings within 200 feet of the proposed development. The purpose of this
requirement is to show the impact of the proposed development on surrounding development.
502.2 Inspections
The Zoning Officer or a duly appointed assistant may examine, or cause to be examined, all
structures and/or land for which an application for a building permit or a zoning certificate has
been requested. Such inspections may be made from time to time during construction and shall
be made upon the termination of construction and prior to the issuance of an occupancy
permit.
502.3 Permits, Applications, Appeals and Certificates
The Zoning Officer shall issue or deny such permits or certificates as required by this

to the Zoning Hearing Board.
502.4 Enforcement
The Zoning Officer is authorized to institute civil enforcement proceedings as a means of
enforcing this Ordinance.
503. PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES
503.1 Building Permits
An application for a building permit will be to show compliance with this and other
appropriate City ordinances. Compliance with other pertinent regulations including those of
the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry may also be required. Applications shall
97
contain information relative to the proposed construction, site plan and use in sufficient detail
to inform the Zoning Officer of the scope and extent of the proposed development. The exact
details required, including sketches, plat plans as well as the number of copies, time limits and
fees for such applications shall be determined by the City.
503.2 Occupancy Permit
An occupancy permit shall be required prior to the occupancy or use of any vacant land prior
to the occupancy or use of any structure hereafter constructed, reconstructed, moved, altered or
enlarged. The purpose of the occupancy permit is to confirm that the development described in
the building permit application has been completed in compliance with the application and this
Ordinance. Occupancy permits shall also be required for a change of use of a structure or land
to a different use and changes to a nonconforming use or structure.
503.3 Zoning Certificate
The zoning certificate shall be issued upon request to confirm that the use of land or a building
within the City is in compliance with this Ordinance. The exact form of the certificate and fees
charged shall be determined by the City.

A sign permit shall be required prior to the erection or alteration of any sign, except those
signs specifically exempted from this requirement in Section 409 of this Ordinance.
(a) Application for a sign permit shall be made in writing to the Zoning Officer, and shall
contain all information necessary for such Officer to determine whether the proposed sign,
or the proposed alterations, conform to all the requirements of this Ordinance.

except after written order from the Zoning Hearing Board or the courts.

(2) The exact size, dimensions and location of the said sign on lot or building.
(3) Any other lawful information which may be required by the Zoning Officer.
504. CONDITIONAL USES, APPEALS, VARIANCES AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS
The Zoning Officer shall receive all requests for conditional uses, appeals, applications for
variances and requests for special exceptions. Said applications shall be on forms as approved by
the City or Board, as appropriate, and shall be accompanied by a fee as set by the City. It is the
intent of the Ordinance that all appeal processes should follow the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code or other appropriate State law. The filing of appeals, special exceptions and
variances shall be within such time limits as shall be set by the Board.
505. VIOLATIONS
505.1 Enforcement Notice
When it appears to the City and/or the Zoning Officer that a violation has occurred, the Zoning
Officer shall send an enforcement notice. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of
record of the parcel on which the violation has occurred, to any person who has filed a written
request to receive enforcement notices regarding the parcel, and to any other person requested
in writing by the owner of record. The enforcement notice shall state the following:
98
(a) The name of the owner of record and any other person against whom the City intends to
take action.
(b) The location of the property in violation.
(c) The specific violation with a description of the requirements which have not been met,
citing in each instance the applicable provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) The date before which the steps for compliance must be commenced and the date before
which the steps must be completed.
(e) That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board within
a prescribed period of time in accordance with procedures set forth in this Ordinance.
(f) That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified, unless extended by appeal
to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly
described.
505.2 Causes of Action
In case any building, structure, landscaping or land is, or is proposed to be, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained or used in violation of this
Ordinance, the City, the Zoning Officer of the City, or any aggrieved owner or tenant of real
property who shows that his property or person will be substantially affected by the alleged
violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent, in
or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation. When any
such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice of that action shall be served upon the
City at least 30 days prior to the time the action is begun by serving a copy of the complaint on
the Board of Commissioners of the City of Hermitage. No such action may be maintained until
such notice has been given.
505.3 Jurisdiction
District justices shall have initial jurisdiction over proceedings brought under this Section.
505.4 Enforcement Remedies
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or permitted the violation of
the provisions of this Ordinance shall, upon being found liable there for in a civil enforcement
proceeding commenced by the City, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the City as a result thereof. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation
by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the City
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or corporation violating this Ordinance to have believed that there was no
such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of this Ordinance
shall be paid over to the City. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed or
interpreted to grant any person or entity other than the City and its Zoning Officer the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this Section.
99
PART 6
ZONING HEARING BOARD
601. CREATION
There is hereby created a Zoning Hearing Board, herein referred to as the “Board,” consisting of
three residents of the City appointed by the Board of Commissioners pursuant to the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. Said Board shall perform all the duties, and exercise
all powers prescribed by said Code and as herein further provided.
602. APPOINTMENT
The terms of office of the Board shall be three years and shall be so fixed that the term of office
of one member shall expire each year. The Board shall promptly notify the Board of
Commissioners of any vacancies which occur. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be only for the
unexpired portion of the term. Members of the Board shall hold no other office in the City, nor be
a member of the Planning Commission. The Board of Commissioners shall also appoint two
alternate members to the Board. The appointment, rights and duties of the alternates shall be in
accordance with Article IX of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
603. REMOVAL OF MEMBERS
Any Board member may be removed for misfeasance or nonfeasance in office, or for other just
cause, by a majority vote of the Board, taken after the member has received 15 days advance
notice of the intent to take such a vote. A hearing shall be held in connection with the vote if the
member shall request it in writing.
604. ORGANIZATION OF BOARD
The Board shall elect from its own membership its officers, who shall serve annual terms as such
and may succeed themselves. For the conduct of any hearing or the taking of any action, a
quorum shall be not less than the majority of all the members of the Board, but where two
members are disqualified to act in a particular matter, the alternate member shall be seated. The
Board may appoint a hearing officer from its own membership to conduct any hearing on its
behalf, and the parties may waive further action by the Board as provided in Section 908 of the
Planning Code. The Board may make, alter and rescind rules and forms for its procedure,
consistent with City ordinances and laws of the Commonwealth. The Board shall keep full public
records of its business and shall submit a report of its activities to the Board of Commissioners as
requested.
605. EXPENDITURES FOR SERVICES
Within the limits of funds appropriated by the Board of Commissioners, the Board may employ
or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other technical and clerical
services. Members of the Board may receive compensation for the performance of their duties, as
may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Commissioners, but in no case shall it exceed the
rate of compensation authorized to be paid to the members of the Board of Commissioners.
606. LEGAL COUNSEL
Where legal counsel is desired, an attorney, other than the City Solicitor, shall be used.
607. HEARINGS
The Board shall conduct hearings and make decisions in accordance with the following
requirements.
(1) Notice shall be given to the public by notice published once each week for two successive
weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. Such notice shall state the time and
100
place of the hearing and the particular nature of the matter to be considered at the hearing.
The first publication shall be not more than 30 days or less than seven days from the date of
the hearing. Written notice shall be given to the applicant, the Zoning Officer, and to any
person who has made timely request for the same. Written notices shall be prescribed by
rules of the Board. In addition to the notice provided herein, written notice of said hearing
shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of land at least one week prior to the
hearing.
(2) The Board of Commissioners may prescribe reasonable fees with respect to hearings before
the Zoning Hearing Board. Fees for said hearings may include compensation for the
secretary and members of the Zoning Hearing Board, notice and advertising costs and
necessary administrative overhead connected with the hearing. The costs, however, shall not
include legal expenses of the Zoning Hearing Board, or its expenses for engineering,
architectural or other technical consultants or expert witness costs.
(3) The hearing shall be held within 60 days from the date of the applicant’s request, unless the
applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time.
(4) The hearings shall be conducted by the Board or the Board may appoint any member as a
hearing officer. The decision, or, where no decision is called for, the findings shall be made
by the Board, but the parties may waive decision or findings by the Board and accept the
decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
(5) The parties to the hearing shall be the City, any person affected by the application who has
made timely appearance of record before the Board, and any other person including civic or
community organizations permitted to appear by the Board. The Board shall have power to
require that all persons who wish to be considered parties enter appearances in writing on
forms provided by the Board for that purpose.
(6) The chairman or acting chairman of the Board or the hearing officer presiding shall have
power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and
the production of relevant documents and papers, including witnesses and documents
requested by the parties.
(7) The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and shall be afforded the
opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument and cross-examine adverse
witnesses on all relevant issues.
(8) Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious
evidence may be excluded.
(9) The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall keep a stenographic record of the
proceedings. The appearance fee for a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant
and the Board. The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by the Board if the transcript
is ordered by the Board or hearing officer or shall be paid by the person appealing from the
decision of the Board if such appeal is made, and in either event the cost of additional
copies shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases the party
requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
(10) The Board or the hearing officer shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, with any party
or his representatives in connection with any issue involved except upon notice and
opportunity for all parties to participate, except that advice from the Board’s Solicitor is
exempt from this restriction; shall not take notice of any communication, reports, staff
memoranda, or other materials unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest the
material so noticed; and shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after the
101
commencement of hearings with any party or his representative unless all parties are given
an opportunity to be present.
(11) The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a written decision or, when
no decision is called for, make written findings on the application within 45 days after the
last hearing before the Board or hearing officer. Where the application is contested or
denied, each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based
thereon together with the reasons therefore. Conclusions based on any provisions of this
Ordinance or the Planning Code, or any rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the
provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of
the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, and there has been no
stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Board shall make his report and
recommendations available to the parties within 45 days, and the parties shall be entitled to
make written representations thereon to the Board prior to final decision or entry of
findings, and the Board’s decision shall be entered no later than 30 days after the report of
the hearing officer. Where the Board fails to render the decision within the period required
by this Ordinance or the Planning Code, or fails to hold the required hearing within 60 days
from the date of the applicant’s request for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have
been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the
record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant
because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the
Board shall give public notice of said decision within ten days in the same manner as
provided in Subsection 607(1) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. Nothing
in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party to appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction.
(12) A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the findings shall be
delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him not later than the day following its
date. To all other persons who have filed their name and address with the Board nor later
than the last day of the hearing, the Board shall provide by mail or otherwise, a brief notice
of the decision or findings and a statement of the place at which the full decision or findings
may be examined.
608. BOARD’S FUNCTIONS
(1) Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance, except those brought before
the Board of Commissioners pursuant to 609.1 and 916.1(a)(2) of the Planning Code.
(2) Challenges to the validity of a land use ordinance raising procedural questions or alleged
defects in the process of enactment or adoption which challenges shall be raised by an appeal
taken within 30 days after the effective date of said ordinance. Where the ordinance appealed
from is the initial zoning ordinance of the City and a zoning hearing board has not been
previously established, the appeal raising procedural questions shall be taken directly to court.
(3) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including, but not limited to,
the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act on the application therefore, the issuance
of any cease and desist order or the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use,
structure or lot.
(4) Appeals from a determination by the City Engineer or the Zoning Officer with reference to
the administration of any floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a
land use ordinance.
102
(5) Applications for variances from the terms of the zoning ordinance and flood hazard ordinance
or such provisions within a land use ordinance, pursuant to 910.2 of the Planning Code and
608(8) of this Ordinance.
(6) Appeals from the Zoning Officer’s determination under 916.2 of the Planning Code.
(7) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or City Engineer in the administration
of any land use ordinance or provision thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion
control and stormwater management insofar as the same relate to development not involving
Article V or VII applications of the Planning Code.
(8) Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions
of this Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may by rule
prescribe the form of application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Board may grant a variance provided that all of the following findings are made
where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship
is due to such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Ordinance in the neighbor-hood or district in which the property is
located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance and
that the authorization of a variance is there for necessary to enable the reasonable use of
the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant;
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford
relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it
may deem necessary to implement the purpose of this Ordinance.
609. PARTIES APPELLANT BEFORE BOARD
Appeals under 608 and proceedings to challenge this Ordinance under 608 may be filed with the
Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or agency of the City, or any person
aggrieved. Requests for a variance under 608 may be filed with the Board by any landowner or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner.
610. TIME LIMITATIONS; PERSONS AGGRIEVED
No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later than thirty (30) days after
an application for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate City
officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval
in any manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason
to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after
such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. See also 914.1
of the Planning Code.
103
611. STAY OF PROCEEDINGS
Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in 608 and during its pendency before the Board, all
land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer
or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning
Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or official
action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the
Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning
Officer or other appropriate agency or body. See also Section 915.1 of the Planning Code.
104

AN	ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF HERMITAGE, MERCER COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, REPEALING THE CURRENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE - CHAPTER 26, PART 1 AND CHAPTER 26, APPENDIX A (ATTACHMENT 1-1 THROUGH 1-8), OF THE HERMITAGE  CODE  OF ORDINANCES - AND ADOPTING A NEW STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MERCER COUNTY STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT  OF ENVIRONMENTAL  RESOURCES.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AND ENACTED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS	OF THE CITY OF HERMITAGE, MERCER COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, AND THE CITY OF HERMITAGE HEREBY ORDAINS AND ENACTS BY AUTHORITY  OF THE SAME AS FOLLOWS:



26-101.	GENERAL  PROVISIONS

101.1	Short Title

This Ordinance shall be known as and may be cited as the "City of Hermitage Stormwater Management Ordinance."

101.2	Statement of Findings

The governing body of the City of Hermitage finds that:

A.	Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed  increases flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases non-point source pollution of water resources.

B.	A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the Commonwealth and this City, their resources, and the environment.





1
 
C.	Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.

D.	Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).

E.	Public education is necessary for the proper understanding and implementation of stormwater management in the community in which it functions.

101.3	Purpose

The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the City of Hermitage and its watersheds by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in Section 101.2 (Statement of Findings) of this Ordinance, through provisions designed to:

A.	Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of this Commonwealth.

B.	Manage the volume, rate and quality of stormwater runoff.

C.	Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.

D.	Manage stormwater runoff as close to the source as possible.

E.	Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.

F.	Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.

G.	Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds from accelerated runoff.

H.	Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent SWM BMPs that are implemented and constructed within the City.

I.	Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

J.	Integrate stormwater management into the land development site planning process.

H.	The City of Hermitage may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this Section at any time for any project that the City believes may pose a threat to public health, safety, property or the environment.

103.3	Volume Controls

The Low Impact Development practices, like those provided in the BMP Manual shall be utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B. For regulated activity areas equal or less than 1 acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Ordinance establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors.

A.	The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.

1.	Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the 2-year 24-hour duration precipitation.

2.	For hydrologic modeling purposes:

a.	Existing pre-development non-forested pervious areas must be considered meadow or its equivalent in good condition.

b.	Existing pre-development impervious areas, when present, must consider twenty (20) percent of the impervious area as meadow in good condition.

B.	The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than one (1) acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:

1.	Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches (2") of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.

2.	At least the first one inch (1") of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.

3.	Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first one-half inch (0.5") of the permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
 

4.	This method is exempt from the requirements of Section 103.4 (Rate Controls).

103.4	Rate Controls

Post-development peak discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development peak discharge rates for the 2-year, 10-year, 25-year, and 100-year storm events.

103.5	Calculation Methodology

Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using either the Rational Method (stormwater conveyance systems only) or a soil cover complex methodology as follows:

A.	Major and minor conveyance systems up to 20 acres may be designed using the Rational Method. The Rational Method may also be used in sizing the minor conveyance systems for larger sites. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater than 20 acres, including on-site and off-site areas, shall use a generally accepted runoff hydrograph technique that is based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex method. Runoff hydrograph methods must be used for design of all stormwater management facilities and for major drainage system designs for all systems with greater than 20 acres of drainage area.

B.	All calculations consistent with this Ordinance using the Soil Cover Complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms presented in Section 103.1 (General Requirements), Item L. If a hydrologic computer model is used for stormwater runoff calculations, the duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours. The SCS Rainfall Type II curve shall be used for the rainfall distribution.

C.	For the purposes of existing pre-development runoff rate determination, undeveloped non-forested pervious areas including disturbed areas must be considered meadow in good condition or its equivalent in good condition. Those areas that have existing impervious areas within the planned development area may be included in the determination of the pre-development flow rate.

D.	All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0,
U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland.  NOAA’s Atlas 14 can be accessed at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.

E.	Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55. Travel time for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using velocities determined using Manning’s equation.
 
F.	Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing (pre-development) and proposed (post- development) conditions to be used in the Soil Cover Complex method shall be obtained from Chapter 2 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55.

G.	Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used for hydraulic computations such as the capacity of open channels, pipes, and storm sewers.

26-104.   STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS

104.1	Small Project Application (2,500 - 5,000 Sq. Ft. of Impervious Area)

This section applies to projects creating new Total Impervious Surface Area up to 5,000 square feet.

If the Total Impervious Surface Area is 2,500 square feet to 5,000 square feet, the project requires a Small Project Application to be submitted to the City and volume controls must be installed to meet the requirements of the surface area or volume of BMPs required.

For areas where runoff from impervious areas can be directed to pervious areas that allow for infiltration, filtration, and increased time of concentration, Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA) Credits may be used. To qualify as DIA the concentrated discharge must meet the following criteria:

For Rooftop Areas:

1.	Area draining to a downspout must be 500 square feet or less,
2.	Discharge must be to an area with a positive slope of 5% (one foot of fall per twenty feet of length, 20:1) or less, and
3.	Be a minimum distance of 75-feet from a watercourse or down slope property line. For Paved Areas (driveways, sidewalks, etc.):
1.	Runoff draining to a point must be 1,000 square feet or less,
2.	Discharge must be to a gravel strip or spreading device, and the
3.	Flow length of the pervious surface must be greater than or equal to the contributing length.

Subtract the DIA from the Total Impervious Surface Area to determine the Adjusted Impervious Surface Area (AISA). Multiply the AISA by 0.2 to determine the required surface area of rain gardens, which shall have a ponded water depth of 6-inches. Multiply the AISA by 0.5 to determine the (rock) volume of subsurface (rock filled) infiltration beds, which shall have a maximum rock depth of 30 inches.
