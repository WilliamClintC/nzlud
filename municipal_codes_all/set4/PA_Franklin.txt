who was a Participant in the Plan on the day prior to the Restatement
Date shall continue to be a Participant on and after the Restatement Date
subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan as set forth herein. Each
Employee who first became an Employee prior to the adoption of this
amended and restated Plan but who was not a Participant in the Plan shall
be a Participant subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan as set forth
herein as of the adoption of this amended and restated Plan. Each such
Employee shall only accrue benefits hereunder from the date of
participation in the Plan.
b.) Participation Requirements. Each Participant hereunder shall be required
to make contributions to the Plan, as provided in Section 143.03 a.)
hereof, and shall execute and complete any enrollment or application

Contributions which had been distributed pursuant to Section 143.08 b.).
d.) Change in Status. A Participant who remains in the service of the
Employer but ceases to be an Employee eligible for participation
hereunder, or ceases or fails to make any contributions which are required
as a condition of participation hereunder, shall have no further benefit
accruals occur until the individual again qualifies as a participant
hereunder eligible to resume such accrual of benefits.
e.) Leave of Absence. During any leave of absence that is not an Authorized
Leave of Absence, a Participant shall be deemed an active Participant and
shall not be given credit for Years of Credited Service nor continue to
accrue any benefits hereunder. If the Employee is not reemployed by the
expiration of such leave of absence, participation in the Plan shall cease
on the date on which such leave of absence commenced. During any
Authorized Leave of Absence, a Participant shall continue to receive credit
for Years of Credited Service to the extent such credit is specifically
granted in writing by Council and is permitted pursuant to applicable law
provided that the Participant shall make Participant contributions to the
Plan during the Authorized Leave of Absence based upon the Participant’s
Compensation immediately prior to leave.
f.) Record Keeping. The Employer shall furnish the Administrator with such
information as will aid the Administrator in the administration of the Plan.
Such information shall include all pertinent data on Employees for
purposes of determining their eligibility to participate in this Plan.

Participant shall be required to have contributions deducted from the
Participant’s Compensation and contributed to the Plan at a rate of five
percent (5%) of the Participant’s annual Compensation.

with the Act, shall annually determine the Minimum Municipal Obligation of
the Employer based upon the reports and calculations of the Actuary. The
Employer shall pay into the Pension Fund, by annual appropriations or
otherwise, the contributions necessary to satisfy the Minimum Municipal
Obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
preclude the Employer from contributing an amount in excess of the
Minimum Municipal Obligation.
c.) State Aid. General municipal pension system State Aid, or any other
amount of State Aid received by the Employer in accordance with the Act
from the Commonwealth may be deposited into the Pension Fund
governed by this Plan and shall be used to reduce the amount of the
Minimum Municipal Obligation of the Employer.
d.) Gifts. The Council is authorized to take by gift, grant, device, or otherwise
any money or property, real or personal, for the benefit of the Plan and
cause the same to be held as a part of the Pension Fund. The care,
management, investment and disposal of such amounts shall be vested in
the Council or its delegate, the Plan Administrator, subject to the direction
of the donor and not inconsistent with applicable laws and the terms of the
Plan.
e.) No Reversion to the Employer. At no time shall it be possible for the Plan
assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries, except that
contributions made by the Employer may be returned to the Employer if
the contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the contribution is
returned within one year of the mistaken payment of the contribution or the
Plan is terminated, as provided in Section 143.11.

a.) Normal Retirement. Each Participant shall be entitled to a Normal
Retirement Benefit after retirement on or after attainment of Normal
Retirement Age.

of the Normal Retirement Benefit shall be equal to fifty percent (50%) of
the Participant’s Average Compensation.
c.) Late Retirement. A Participant may continue in Employment beyond the
attainment of Normal Retirement Age subject to the Employer’s rules and
regulations regarding retirement age. If a Participant who has met the
requirements of Subsection 143.02 a.) continues in Employment beyond
the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date, there shall be no retirement
benefits paid until Employment has ceased and the Participant’s
retirement actually commences. The retirement benefit of a Participant
described in this Subsection 143.04 c.) shall be calculated in accordance
with Subsection 143.04 b.) on the basis of Average Compensation as of
the Participant’s actual retirement and shall commence on the
Participant’s Late Retirement Date.
d.) Application for Benefit. A Participant must complete and execute an
application for benefit on a form and in the manner prescribed by the Plan
Administrator and deliver the said application to the Plan Administrator at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which benefit payments are to
commence. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
retirement benefit payments or any other benefit payments shall be due or
payable on or before the first day of the month coincident with or next
following the date that is thirty (30) days after the date the Plan
Administrator receives the application for benefit.
e.) Limitation of Liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the
Employer, the Plan Administrator, any fiduciary or any agent or
representative of any of the foregoing, to provide any retirement or other
benefit to any Participant or Beneficiary which is in excess of the Third
Class City Code or which cannot be provided from the assets available in
the Pension Fund, whether such benefits are in pay status or otherwise
payable under the terms of the Plan. The Council retains the right to
amend or terminate this Plan consistent with applicable law at any time,
with or without cause and whether or not such action directly or indirectly
results in the suspension, reduction or termination of any benefit payable
under the Plan or in pay status, and without liability to any person for any
such action.
f.) Special Provision for Restated Plans. The benefit amount of any
Participant who retired prior to the Restatement Date shall not be in any
way altered by the provisions of this Plan, except where otherwise
expressly indicated herein, and shall continue to be determined on the
basis of the terms of the Plan in effect on the day preceding the
Restatement Date.
143.05 DISABILITY RETIREMENT
a.) Disability Retirement. A Participant who has completed at least ten (10)
Years of Credited Service and who incurs a Total and Permanent
Disability before attaining Normal Retirement Age shall be entitled to a
Disability Retirement Benefit as of the Disability Retirement Date.
b.) Disability Retirement Benefit. A Participant who shall be entitled to a
Disability Retirement Benefit under Subsection 143.05 a.) shall receive a
benefit commencing on the Participant’s Disability Retirement Date and
paid monthly. The amount of the Disability Retirement Benefit shall be
equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Participant’s Average Compensation.
c.) Payment of Disability Benefit. Payment of a Disability Retirement Benefit
shall be made monthly commencing on the Participant’s Disability
Retirement Date and ending on the earlier of the date of death of the
Participant, the date that the Participant’s Total and Permanent Disability
shall cease, or the date that the Participant would attain Normal
Retirement Age if the Participant had continued to accrue Years of
Credited Service to such date (such a Participant shall thereafter receive a
retirement benefit equal to the amount of the Disability Retirement Benefit
which will be deemed to be the Normal Retirement Benefit). If the
Participant’s Total and Permanent Disability shall cease prior to the
attainment of the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age, the Participant
shall be deemed to have terminated Employment as of the Disability
Retirement Date for purposes of this Plan unless the Participant shall
resume active Employment within three (3) months following the date on
which such Total and Permanent Disability ceased. A Participant who
fails to resume active Employment after Total and Permanent Disability
ceases shall not be entitled to a distribution of Accumulated Contributions
pursuant to Subsection 143.08 b.) to the extent that the total amount of
Disability Retirement Benefits paid exceeds the value of the Participant’s
Accumulated Contributions as of the Disability Retirement Date, and shall
not be entitled to any other benefits under the Plan as a result of the
accumulation of any Years of Credited Service as of the Disability
Retirement Date.
d.) Verification of Disability. The Plan Administrator shall determine whether
a Participant shall have incurred a Total and Permanent Disability. Proof
of Total and Permanent Disability shall consist of the sworn statement of
three (3) practicing physicians, designated by the Plan Administrator, that
the Participant has incurred a Total and Permanent Disability. If the Plan
Administrator shall determine that a Participant who is Totally and
Permanently Disabled has recovered sufficiently to resume active
Employment or if a Participant refuses to undergo a medical examination
as directed by the Plan Administrator (such a medical examination may
not be required more frequently than once in any given twelve (12) month
period), the payment of Disability Retirement Benefits shall cease.
e.) Cessation of Disability. A Participant who is receiving payment of
Disability Retirement Benefits under this Plan must notify the Plan
Administrator of any change in condition which may cause the
Participant’s entitlement to receipt of such benefits to cease. If a
Participant fails to provide immediate Notice to the Plan Administrator of
any such change in status and thereby continues to receive payment of
benefits hereunder to which the Participant is not entitled, the Plan
Administrator may take whatever action is necessary and permitted under
applicable law to recover any amount of improper payments, including
offsetting such amounts against any future payment of retirement or other
benefits under the Plan or legal action. The Plan Administrator may also
recover the costs of any such action.
143.06 DEATH BENEFITS
a.) Death of Participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of a Participant,
there shall be payable benefits in accord with the following sections of this
Section 143.06.
b.) Death Prior to Retirement. If a Participant shall die prior to the
commencement of the payment of any retirement benefits under this Plan,
the Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a distribution of the Participant’s
Accumulated Contributions determined as of the date of death of the
Participant.
c.) Death After Retirement. If a Participant shall die after the payment of the
pension has commenced or where a Participant shall be killed in the
service, the surviving spouse of the Participant shall receive for his or her
lifetime, as long as he or she does not remarry, one-half of the pension the
Participant was receiving or would have been entitled to had she or he
been retired at the time of her or his death.
143.07 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
a.) Normal Form. The Normal Form for payment of retirement benefits shall
be an annuity for the life of the Participant with one-half of such annuity
continuing to the surviving spouse of the Participant for her or his lifetime
so long as she or he does not remarry, paid in equal semi-monthly
installments.
b.) Commencement of Benefits. A Participant may make an Election to
commence receiving distribution of retirement benefits as of the
Participant’s Normal Retirement Date or Late Retirement Date, whichever
is applicable, or may defer such payments to a date not later than the
required date for commencement of benefits determined under Subsection
143.13 g.).
c.) Nonduplication of Benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a
Participant who is receiving a retirement benefit under this Plan and who
shall resume Employment shall have benefit payments suspended until
the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date such
Employment shall cease. Upon resumption of benefit payments, such
Participant shall receive the greater of the amount of the suspended
benefit or the amount of benefit based upon Average Compensation and
Years of Credited Service as of the date that such period of resumed
Employment shall cease.
d.) Personal Right of Participant. The right to receive any benefits under this
Plan is a personal right of the Participant and shall expire upon the death
of the Participant. No heir, legatee, devisee, Beneficiary, assignee or
other person claiming by or through a Participant shall have any interest in
any benefits hereunder unless clearly and expressly so provided by the
terms of this Plan. A Participant’s Election, failure to make an Election or
revocation of an Election hereunder shall be final and binding on all
persons.
143.08 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
a.) Rights of Terminated Employees. A Participant who shall cease to be an
Employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided shall have all
interest and rights under this Plan limited to those contained in the
following Subsections of this Section.
b.) Distribution of Accumulated Contributions. A Participant whose
Employment with the Employer shall terminate for any reason other than
death or Total and Permanent Disability prior to attainment of Normal
Retirement Age shall be entitled to receive a distribution of Accumulated
Contributions. Upon receipt of such Accumulated Contributions, said
Participant and Beneficiary shall not be entitled to any further payments
from the Plan.
c.) Deferred Retirement Benefit. A Participant who shall have completed at
least twenty (20) Years of Credited Service and who shall be dismissed,
voluntarily retired, or otherwise deprived of active Employment other than
due to death or Total and Permanent Disability prior to attainment of
Normal Retirement Age shall be entitled to elect to receive a deferred
retirement benefit in lieu of a distribution of Accumulated Contributions
under Subsection 143.08 b.) and in lieu of a Deferred Vested Benefit
under Subsection 143.08 d.). If such election is made, the Participant
must continue to pay contributions into the Pension Fund on a monthly
basis equal to the monthly amount due and paid under Subsection 143.03
a.) during the last full month of Employment with such contributions to
continue until the Participant attains sixty (60) years of age. Such
deferred retirement benefit shall be equal to the benefit determined
pursuant to Subsection 143.04 b.) hereof and shall commence after
application under Subsection 143.04 d.) not earlier than the date which is
the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date under the Plan.
d.) Deferred Vested Benefit. Should a Participant terminate employment
before reaching the date which would have been the Participant’s earliest
retirement date had the Participant continued employment by meeting the
minimum age and minimum period of continuous service requirements but
after having completed twelve (12) years of full-time service, the
Participant shall be entitled to vest his or her retirement benefits subject to
the following conditions:
(1) the Participant must file with the Pension Plan Board of the pension
fund a written notice of his or her intention to vest;
(2) the Participant must include in the notice the date the member
intends to terminate his or her service as an employee;
(3) the termination date shall be at least thirty (30) days later than the
date of notice to vest;
(4) the Participant must be in good standing with the Employer on the
date of notice to vest; and
(5) the Pension Plan Board shall indicate on the notice to vest the rate
of monthly pay of the Participant as of the date of said notice to
vest or the highest average annual salary which the Participant
received during any five (5) years of service preceding said date,
whichever is the higher.
Upon reaching the date which would have been the Participant’s earliest
retirement date had the Participant continued his or her employment with
the Employer, the Participant shall notify the Pension Plan Board, in
writing, that the Participant desires to collect his or her pension. The
amount of retirement benefits the Participant is entitled to receive under
this section shall be computed as follows and shall be in lieu of any other
benefit under the Plan:
(1) the initial determination of the Participant’s base retirement benefits
shall be computed on the salary indicated on the notice to vest; and
(2) the portion of the base retirement benefits due the Participant shall
be determined by applying to the base amount the percentage that
his or her years of service actually rendered bears to the years of
service which would have been rendered had the Participant
continued to be employed by the Employer until his or her earliest
retirement date.
143.09 ADMINISTRATION
a.) Plan Administrator. The Pension Plan Board shall be the Plan
Administrator and shall have the power and authority to do all acts and to

hundred and twenty (120) days of receipt of such Notice), submit its
decision in writing to the person or persons whose claim has been
denied. The decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all

specified above shall be deemed to have waived such claim or right
to review.

a.) Operation of the Pension Fund. The Council of the City of Franklin is
hereby authorized to hold and supervise the investment of the assets of
the Pension Fund, subject to the provisions of the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of this Plan and any amendment
thereto.
The Pension Fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the Plan
and, to the extent not paid directly by the Employer, to pay the expenses
of administering the Plan pursuant to authorization by the Employer.
The Employer intends the Plan to be permanent and for the exclusive
benefit of its Employees. It expects to make the contributions to the
Pension Fund required under the Plan. The Employer shall not be liable
in any manner for any insufficiency in the Pension Fund; benefits are
payable only from the Pension Fund, and only to the extent that there are
monies available therein.
The Pension Fund will consist of all funds held by the Employer under the
Plan, including contributions made pursuant to the provisions hereof and
the investments, reinvestments, and proceeds thereof. The Pension Fund
shall be held, managed, and administered pursuant to the terms of the
Plan. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the Employer
has exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the Pension
Fund assets. The Employer may, however, appoint a trustee, custodian,
and/or investment manager, at its sole discretion. If the Employer does
not appoint a trustee, Council shall be the trustee.

cash or on credit at such times as it may deem appropriate; to

exchange thereof.
(4) To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting

mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation
pursuant to any such plan.

property held in the fund.
(6) To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the fund
and in connection therewith to grant proxies, discretionary or
otherwise.

appropriate for the purposes of this Plan no matter where situated,
including in those cases where a bank has been appointed to serve
as trustee hereunder, the savings department of its own
commercial bank.
(8) In addition to the foregoing powers, the Employer shall also have all
of the powers, rights, and privileges conferred upon trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts,
take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the Employer may deem

commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this
Plan with assets of other eligible, participating plans through such a
medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the Plan
which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to
all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the Plan, to
the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled trust
fund by the Plan.
(11) To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the Plan, provided that if a trustee is appointed
by the Employer, such trustee shall make such distribution only at
the direction of the Employer.
(12) To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce, or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the Plan.
(13) To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without

the interest of any person therein, which the fund is required to pay,
to contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax,
assessment, claim, or demand which may be levied or made again
or in respect of the Pension Fund, the income, property, or transfer
thereof, or in any matter or thing connected therewith.
(15) To appoint any persons or firms (including but not limited to,
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians,
appraisers, consultants, professional plan administrators and other
specialists), or otherwise act to secure specialized advice or
assistance, as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with
the management of the Fund; to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, the Employer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the Employer, taking into account the interests of the Participants
and Beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
(16) To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all
or any part of the Fund assets, provided that each of such persons
or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the
Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as defined in that act),
or in an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire, or
dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one
state; in such event, the Employer shall follow the directions of such
Investment Manager or Managers with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of such Investment Manager or Managers, nor shall it be
under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any Fund
assets which are subject to the management of such Investment
Manager or Managers. If the Employer appoints a trustee, the
trustee shall not be permitted to retain such an Investment Manager
except with the express written consent of the Employer.
c.) Common Investments. The Employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual Participants or to maintain separate
investments for each Participant’s account but may invest contributions
and any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
d.) Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation
as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the Employer and the
trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by law. Such
compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the trustee in
carrying out his functions, shall constitute a charge upon the Employer or
the Pension Fund, which may be executed at any time after thirty (30)
days written Notice to the Employer. The Employer shall be under no
obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of its failure
to do so, the trustees shall be entitled to pay the same, or to reimburse
themselves for the payment thereof, from the Pension Fund.
e.) Periodic Accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the Pension Fund shall be
evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the Fund, and as
of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and such
additional dates as requested by the Employer, showing the condition of
the Fund and all receipts, disbursements, and other transactions effected
by the trustee during the period covered by the accounting, based on fair
market values prevailing as of such date.
f.) Value of the Pension Fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the Pension Fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof,
shall be made by the Employer or its appointed trustee, whose decisions
shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto, the
Participants and Beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the Employer or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely
upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers,
and other experts, and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to
sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as
contained in newspapers and in financial publications.
143.11 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PENSION PLAN OR PENSION
FUND
a.) Amendment of the Plan. The Employer may amend this Plan at any time
or from time to time by an instrument in writing executed in the name of
the Employer under this municipal seal by officers fully authorized to
execute such instrument and delivered to the Council provided however:
(1) that no amendment shall deprive any Participant or any Beneficiary
of a deceased Participant of any of the benefits to which each is
entitled under this Plan with respect to contributions previously
made;
(2) that no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this Plan other than for the benefit of Employees and no
funds contributed to this Plan or assets of this Plan shall, except as
provided in Subsection 143.11 e.), ever revert to or be used or
enjoyed by the Employer; and
(3) that no amendment to the Plan which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in
Subsection 143.12 c.) has been prepared and presented to the
Council in accordance with the Act.
b.) Termination of the Plan. The Employer shall have the power to terminate
this Plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument in writing executed in
the name of the Employer.
c.) Automatic Termination of Contributions. Subject to the provisions of the
Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
Employer to make contributions to the Pension Fund shall automatically
terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the Employer, upon its
adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment for
the benefit of its creditors.
d.) Distribution Upon Termination. In the event of the termination of the Plan,
all amounts of vested benefits accrued by the affected Participants as of
the date of such termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be
nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the Plan, the
Employer shall direct either (1) that the Plan Administrator continue to hold
the vested Accrued Benefits of Participants in the Pension Fund in
accordance with the provisions of the Plan (other than those provisions
related to forfeitures) without regard to such termination until all funds
have been distributed in accordance with the provisions; or (2) that the
Plan Administrator immediately distribute to each Participant an amount
equal to the vested Accrued Benefit to the date.
If there are insufficient assets in the Pension Fund to provide for all vested
Accrued Benefits as of the date of Plan termination, priority shall first be
given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to mandatory or
voluntary Employee contributions before assets are applied to the
distribution of any vested benefits attributable to other sources hereunder.
All other assets attributable to the terminated Plan shall be distributed and
disposed of in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the
terms of any instrument adopted by the Employer which affects such
termination.
e.) Residual Assets. If all liabilities to vested Participants and any others
entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the Plan have been
satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the Pension Fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the Employer insofar as
such return does not contravene any provision of the law, and any
remaining balance, in excess of Employer contributions, shall be returned
to the Commonwealth.
f.) Exclusive Benefit Rule. In the event of the discontinuance and termination
of the Plan as provided herein, the Employer shall dispose of the Pension
Fund in accordance with the terms of the Plan and applicable law; at no
time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan shall any part of
the corpus or income of the Pension Fund, after deducting any
administrative or other expenses properly chargeable to the Pension
Fund, be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive
benefit of the Participants in the Plan, their Beneficiaries or their estates.
143.12 PROVISIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE MUNICIPAL PENSION PLAN
FUNDING STANDARD AND RECOVERY ACT OF 1984
a.) Actuarial Valuations. The Plan’s Actuary shall perform an actuarial
valuation at least biennially unless the Employer is applying or has applied
for supplemental state assistance pursuant to Section 603 of the Act,
whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall be made annually.
Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of the beginning
of each Plan Year occurring in an odd-numbered calendar year, beginning
with the year 1985.
Such actuarial valuation shall be prepared and certified by an Approved
Actuary, as such term is defined in the Act.
The expenses attributable to the preparation of any actuarial valuation
report or experience investigation required by the Act or any other
expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act and which are
directly associated with administering the plan shall be an allowable
administrative expense payable from the assets of the Pension Fund.
Such allowable expenses shall include, but not be limited, to the following:
(1) investment costs associated with obtaining authorized investments
and investment management fees;
(2) accounting expenses;
(3) premiums for insurance coverage on fund assets;
(4) reasonable and necessary counsel fees incurred for advice or to
defend the fund; and
(5) legitimate travel and education expense for pension plan officials;
provided, however, that the municipal officials of the Employer, in
their fiduciary role, shall monitor the services provided to the Plan
to ensure that the expenses are necessary, reasonable, and benefit
the pension plan and, further provided, that the Plan Administrator
shall document all such expenses item by item, and where
necessary, hour by hour.
b.) Duties of Chief Administrative Officer. Such actuarial reports shall be
prepared and filed under the supervision of the Chief Administrative
Officer.
The Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan shall determine the financial
requirements of the Plan on the basis of the most recent actuarial report
and shall determine the Minimum Municipal Obligation of the Employer
with respect to funding the plan for any given Plan Year. The Chief
Administrative Officer shall submit the financial requirements of the Plan
and the Minimum Municipal Obligation of the Employer to the Council
annually and shall certify the accuracy of such calculations and their
conformance with the Act.
c.) Benefit Modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the Employer, the Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan
shall provide to the Council a cost estimate of the proposed benefit plan
modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved Actuary,
which estimate shall disclose to the Council the impact of the proposed
benefit plan modification on the future financial requirements of the Plan
and the future Minimum Municipal Obligation of the Employer with respect
to the Plan.
d.) Effective Date. If there is more than one permissible effective date for any
required change in the Code Section 415(b) provisions, then the change
shall be effective as of the latest permissible effective date; however, any
adjustment in the dollar limit under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), whether
required or permissible, shall take effect automatically as of the earliest
permissible effective date. The “applicable mortality table” in Rev. Rul.
2001-62 is effective from December 31, 2002, through December 31,
2007. Effective as of January 1, 2008, the “applicable mortality table” and
“applicable interest rate” are found in Rev. Rul. 2007-67. (Ord. 5 of 2013,
Sect. 1, Passed 9-9-2013)
143.13 APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
a.) Definitions.
(1) The following definitions apply for purposes of this Article only:
(i) "Leased Employee" shall mean, effective as of January 1,
1997, any person (other than an employee of the recipient)
who pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and
any other person ("leasing organization") has performed
services for the recipient (or for the recipient and related
persons determined in accordance with Code Section
414(n)(6)) on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at
least one year, and such services are performed under
primary direction or control by the recipient.
(ii) "Limitation Year" shall mean the Plan Year.
b.) Leased Employees and Independent Contractors.
(1) Leased Employees and independent contractors are not eligible to
participate in this Plan. Any person whom the Council does not
regard as being an Employee shall not be eligible to participate.
c.) Limit on Compensation.
(1) Compensation is subject to the limitation under Code Section
401(a)(17), which is $230,000 for the Plan Year beginning in 2008.
The limit is automatically adjusted periodically, without formal
amendment, for changes in the law and cost-of-living adjustments
under Code Section 401(a)(17).
d.) Maximum Annual Benefit.
(1) General Rule - Except as otherwise provided, this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415 and the
regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically
incorporated herein by reference. If a benefit payable to a
Participant under this Plan would otherwise exceed the limit under
Code Section 415, the benefit will be reduced to the maximum
permissible benefit.
(2) Effective Date – If there is more than one permissible effective date
for any required change in the Code Section 415(b) provisions,
then the change shall be effective as of the latest permissible
effective date; however, any adjustment in the dollar limit under
Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), whether required or permissible, shall
take effect automatically as of the earliest permissible effective
date. The “applicable mortality table” in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 became
effective as of December 31, 2002.
(3) No Reduction in Accrued Benefits - Notwithstanding the above, no
change in the limits under this Article shall reduce the benefit of any
Participant.
(4) Multiple Plans – If a Participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code Section 415(b) or
(e), and if the aggregated benefits would otherwise exceed the limit
under Code Section 415(b) or (e), then benefits shall be reduced
first under this Plan. [Historical Note: Code Section 415(e) applied
for Limitation Years beginning prior to 2000.]
(5) Mandatory Contributions - Participant Contributions are annual
additions, and any benefit attributable to Participant Contributions is
not included in the benefit subject to the limits of Code Section
415(b) or (e). This subsection does not apply to contributions
“picked-up” in accordance with Code Section 414(h).
(6) Permissive Service Credit - Effective as of January 1, 1998, if a
Participant makes a purchase of permissive service credit (within
the meaning of Code Section 415(n)) under the Plan, the benefit
derived from the contributions made to purchase the service credit
shall be treated as part of the benefit subject to the limitations
under this section.
e.) Limit on Annual Additions.
(1) Annual Additions - Except as otherwise provided, annual additions
(which include Participant Contributions) under this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415(c) and the
regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically
incorporated herein by reference. If an annual addition would
otherwise exceed the limit under Code Section 415(c), the excess
annual addition will be eliminated in accordance with methods
permitted under Rev. Proc. 2008-50 (Rev. Proc. 2006-27 prior to
2009) or its successor. (Ord. 5 of 2013, Sect. 2, Passed 9-9-2013)
(2) Multiple Plans - If a Participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code Section 415(c), and
if the annual additions would otherwise exceed the limit under Code
Section 415(c), annual additions will first be reduced under the
other plan. If there is more than one other plan, annual additions
will first be reduced under the plan with the greatest amount of
annual additions.
(3) Effective Date – The limits under which Code Section 415(c) are
adjusted periodically in accordance with changes in the law or cost
of living adjustments without the need for a plan amendment. If
there is more than one permissible effective date for any required
change relating to Code Section 415(c), then the change shall be
effective as of the earliest permissible effective date.
(4) 415(c) Compensation – For the purposes of this Section
“compensation” includes only those items specified in Treas. Reg.
§1.415(c)-2(b)(1) or (2) and excludes all items listed in Treas. Reg.
§1.415(c)-2(c), the terms of which are specifically incorporated
herein by reference. Effective as of January 1, 2009, to the extent
required by the Heroes Earnings Assistance Tax Relief Tax Act of
2008 (HEART Act), differential wage payments shall be included in
Compensation. (Ord. 5 of 2013, Sect. 3, Passed 9-9-2013)
f.) Direct Rollovers.
(1) Effective as of January 1, 1993, if a Participant, a spousal
beneficiary, or an alternate payee (who is a spouse or former
spouse of a Participant) is entitled (under other provisions of this
Plan) to receive an “eligible rollover distribution” of at least two
hundred ($200) dollars, the distributee may elect that the Plan
Administrator transfer all or part (provided that the part is at least
five hundred ($500) dollars) to any “eligible retirement plan”
capable of accepting such a transfer.
(2) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(i) An “eligible rollover distribution” is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee,
except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:
(a) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially
equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually)
made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and
the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified
period of ten years or more; (b) any distribution to the extent
such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9);
(c) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in
gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for
net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer
securities), and (d) effective as of January 1, 2002, any
hardship distribution. Effective as of January 1, 2002 clause
(iii) does not apply to any after-tax Participant contributions
that are paid to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Code Section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified
defined contribution plan described in Code Section 401(a)
or 403(a) or effective January 1, 2007, a 403(b) annuity
contract that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution which is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
(ii) An “eligible retirement plan” is an individual retirement
account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual
retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an
annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), or a qualified
trust described in Code Section 401(a), that accepts the
distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the
case of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse,
prior to January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan was an
individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.
Effective as of January 1, 2002, an “eligible retirement plan”
includes an annuity contract described in Code Section
403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which
is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or
any agency or instrumentality of a state or political
subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately
account for amounts transferred into such plan from this
plan. Effective January 1, 2008 an eligible retirement plan
shall include a Roth IRA as that term is defined in Code
Section 408A(b) that agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred from this Plan.
(iii) A distributee includes an Employee or former Employee. In
addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving
spouse and the Employee's or former Employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section
414(p)(11), are distributees with regard to the interest of the
spouse or former spouse.
(iv) Effective as of January 1, 2002, an Employee may, in
accordance with Code Section 457(e)(17), make a trustee-to
trustee transfer from an eligible deferred compensation plan
(as defined in Code Section 457(b)) to this Plan for the
purpose of purchasing service credit (to the extent that such
purchases are permitted under the terms of the Plan) or
repaying a cash-out of contributions refunded under the
Plan.
g.) Minimum Required Distributions.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the
distribution of a Participant’s benefits shall be made in accordance
with the requirements and conditions of and shall otherwise comply
with Code Section 401(a)(9). For purposes of complying with Code
Section 401(a)(9), life expectancies shall be determined in
accordance with the 1987 proposed regulations prior to January 1,
2003 and with the final regulations (§1.401(a)(9)-1 through
§1.401(a)(9)-9) on or after January 1, 2003.
(2) Effective as of January 1, 1997 distribution of a Participant’s
benefits shall begin not later than April 1st of the calendar year
following the later of:
(i) the calendar year in which the Participant attains age
seventy and one-half (70½), or
(ii) the calendar year in which the Participant retires.
Distributions must be made over a period not exceeding the life of
the Participant or the joint lives a Participant and his Beneficiary.
(3) Distributions to a Participant and his Beneficiaries shall only be
made in accordance with the incidental death benefit requirements
of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and the regulations thereunder.
(4) This section does not authorize the payment of any benefit in any
form not permitted under another provision of the Plan.
h.) Approved Domestic Relations Orders.
(1) All rights and benefits, including elections, provided to a Participant
in this Plan shall be subject to the rights afforded to any "alternate
payee" under what is recognized pursuant to State law support
provisions as an "approved domestic relations order.”
i.) Credit for Qualified Military Service.
(1) Effective as of December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any provision
of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service
credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in
accordance Code Section 414(u).
j.) Vesting Upon Plan Termination.
(1) Upon the termination of this Plan, or complete discontinuance of
contributions (within the meaning of pre-ERISA Code Section
401(a)(7)) to this Plan, each Employee as of the date of such
termination or discontinuance shall become vested to the extent
that the Plan is funded.
k.) Consent for Lump-Sum Distributions.
(1) Effective January 1, 2006, notwithstanding any other provision of
the Plan, any distribution to a Participant made prior to the earlier of
age 62 or Normal Retirement Age of an amount in excess of $1,000
that is an eligible rollover distribution as set forth in the Plan and the
Code shall be made only upon consent of the Participant.
l.) Non-spouse Beneficiaries: Effective as of January 1, 2007, if a
Beneficiary who is not a surviving spouse is entitled to receive what would
otherwise be an “eligible rollover distribution,” the Beneficiary may, in
accordance with Code Section 402(c)(11), make a trustee-to-trustee
transfer of that amount to an IRA or individual retirement annuity (other
than an endowment contract); provided that:
(1) the transfer is made not later than the end of the fourth year after
the year of the Participant’s death, and
(2) the account or annuity to which the amount is transferred is treated
as an inherited IRA or individual retirement annuity in accordance
with Code Section 408(d)(3)(C).
(Ord. 5 of 2013, Sect. 4, Passed 9-9-2013)
m.) Heros Earnings Assistance Relief Tax Act 0f 2008 (HEART Act): Except
where otherwise specifically provided to the contrary in this Plan, effective
for deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2007, the Plan will provide
retirement benefits and service credit to the extent that the Plan is
required and mandated by the HEART Act to provide said benefits and/or
service credit. (Ord. 5 of 2013, Sect. 5, Passed 9-9-2013)
n.) Vesting at Normal Retirement Age: Upon attainment of Normal
Retirement Age, a Participant shall be 100% vested in his Normal
Retirement Benefit. (Ord. 5 of 2013, Sect. 6, Passed 9-9-2013)
143.14 MISCELLANEOUS
a.) Employment Rights. Participation in this Plan shall not give any right to
any Employee to be retained in the employ of the Employer nor shall it
interfere with the right of the Employer to discharge any Employee and to
deal with such Employee without regard to the effect that such treatment
might have upon participation in this Plan.
b.) Meaning of Certain Words. As used herein, the masculine gender shall
include the feminine gender and the singular shall include the plural in all
cases where such meaning would be appropriate. Headings of Sections
and Subsections are inserted only for convenience of reference and are
not to be considered in the construction of the Plan.
c.) Information to be Furnished by the Employer. The Employer shall furnish
to the Plan Administrator (and where applicable, the trustee) information in
the Employer’s possession as the Plan Administrator and the trustee shall
require from time to time to perform their duties under the Plan.
d.) Severability of Provisions. Should any provisions of this Plan be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect
the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and
enforced as if said illegal and invalid provisions had never been inserted
herein.
e.) Incapacity of Participant. If any Participant shall be physically or mentally
incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any payment of
pension benefits hereunder, the Plan Administrator, upon the receipt of
satisfactory evidence that such Participant is so incapacitated and that
another person or institution is maintaining the Participant and that no
guardian or committee has been appointed for the Participant, may
provide for such payment of pension benefits hereunder to such person or
institution so maintaining the Participant, and any such payments so made
shall be deemed for every purpose to have been made to such
Participant.
f.) Pension Fund for Sole Benefit of Participants. The income and principal
of the Pension Fund are for the sole use and benefit of the Participants of
this Plan, and, to the extent permitted by law, shall be free, clear and
discharged from and are not to be in any way liable for debts, contracts or
agreements, now contracted or which may hereafter be contracted, and
from all claims and liabilities now or hereafter incurred by any Participant
or Beneficiary.
g.) Benefits for a Deceased Participant. If any benefit shall be payable under
the Plan to or on behalf of a Participant who has died, if the Plan provides
that the payment of such benefits shall be made to the Participant’s
estate, and if no administration of such Participant’s estate is pending in
the court of proper jurisdiction, then the Plan Administrator, at its sole
option, may pay such benefits to the surviving spouse of such deceased
Participant, or, if there be no such surviving spouse, to such Participant’s
then living issue, per stirpes; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prevent the Plan Administrator from insisting upon the
commencement of estate administration proceedings and the delivery of
any such benefits to a duly appointed executor or administrator.
h.) Assets in Pension Fund. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
give any Participant or Beneficiary any interest in any specific property of
the Pension Fund or any right except to receive such distributions as are
expressly provided for under the Plan.
i.) Personal Liability. Subject to the provisions of the Act and unless
otherwise specifically required by other applicable laws, no past, present
or future officer or agent of the Employer or Plan Administrator shall be
personally liable to any Participant, Beneficiary or other person under any
provision of the Plan.

145.01 DEFINITIONS
The following words and phrases as used in this Plan shall have the meaning
set below unless a different meaning is otherwise clearly required by the context:
a. “Accrued Benefit” means the amount of retirement benefit credited to
the Participant determined in accordance with Section 145.04 as of
such date and multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the Participant’s completed years of Service as of such date and the

required to be completed by the Participant to attain Normal Retirement
Age under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the fraction exceed one (1.0).
In no event, however, shall the Accrued Benefit exceed the
maximum limitation, determined as of the date of computation, provided
under Subsection 145.04(a). All Accrued Benefits are subject to all
applicable limitations, reductions, offsets, and actuarial adjustments
provided by the Plan prior to the actual payment thereof and no Accrued
Benefits shall be paid unless the Participant satisfies all requirements
hereunder for entitlement to receive such benefit.
b. “Act” means the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and
Recovery Act, enacted as P.L. 1005 (Act 205 of 1984), as the same may
be amended from time to time.
c. “Actuarial Equivalent” shall mean a form of benefit differing in time,
period, or manner of payment from a specific benefit provided under the
Plan, but having the same value when computed using the 1984 Unisex
Mortality Table with interest computed at 7.5 percent.
d. “Actuarially Sound” means a Plan which is being funded annually at a
level not lower than the financial requirements of the Plan pursuant to
the Act.
e. “Actuary” means the person, partnership, association or corporation
which at any given time serves as Actuary to the plan; provided that
such Actuary must be an "Approved Actuary" as defined in the Act.

as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the Employer and the
trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by law. Such
compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the trustee in
carrying out his functions, shall constitute a charge upon the Employer or
the Pension Fund, which may be executed at any time after 30 days
written notice to the Employer. The Employer shall be under no obligation
to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of its failure to do so,
the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to reimburse themselves
for the payment thereof, from the Pension Fund.

of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and such
additional dates as requested by the Employer, showing the condition of
the Fund and all receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected
by the trustee during the period covered by the accounting, based on fair
market values prevailing as of such date.
f. Value of the Pension Fund: All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the Pension Fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof,
shall be made by the Employer or its appointed trustee, whose decisions
shall be final. In making any such determination, the Employer or trustee
shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any information
furnished by brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also be
entitled to rely upon reports as to sales and quotations, both on security
exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in financial

convened for special or general business. Such notice may,
however, be waived by the unanimous consent of the members.
(3) At the annual meeting, or as soon thereafter as is practical, the
Board shall designate a depository or depositories for the Fund.
This designation of a depository or depositories shall be valid for
the period of on year, or until such time as another depository is

the Treasurer of the Board shall immediately deposit all monies in
the Fund in the name of the Fund.
(4) The Board shall keep all permanent records and accounts and
perform all duties as shall be necessary for the efficient execution
of the Plan.

document all such expenses item by item, and where
necessary, hour by hour.

d. Maximum Annual Benefit
(1) General Rule – Except as otherwise provided, this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415 and the
regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically

415, the benefit will be reduced to the maximum permissible benefit.
(2) Effective Date – If there is more than one permissible effective
date for any required change in the Code Section 415(b) provisions,
then the change shall be effective as of the latest permissible
effective date; however, any adjustment in the dollar limit under Code

Years beginning prior to 2000.]

living adjustments without the need for a plan amendment. If there is
more than one permissible effective date for any required change
relating to Code Section 415(c), then the change shall be effective as
of the earliest permissible effective date.
f. Direct Rollovers
(a) Effective as of January 1, 1993, if a Participant, a spousal beneficiary,
or an alternate payee (who is a spouse or former spouse of a
Participant) is entitled (under other provisions of this Plan) to receive
an “eligible rollover distribution” of at least two hundred ($200) dollars,
the distributee may elect that the Plan Administrator transfer all or
part (provided that the part is at least five hundred ($500) dollars) to
any “eligible retirement plan” capable of accepting such a transfer.
(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(i) An “eligible rollover distribution” is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee,
except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:
(a) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially
equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually)
made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and
the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified
period of ten years or more; (b) any distribution to the extent
such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9);
(c) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in
gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for
net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer
securities), and (d) effective as of January 1, 2002, any
hardship distribution. Effective as of January 1, 2002 clause
(iii) does not apply to any after-tax Participant contributions
that are paid to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Code Section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified
defined contribution plan described in Code Section 401(a)
or 403(a) or effective January 1, 2007, a 403(b) annuity

distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case
of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, prior to
January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan was an individual
retirement account or individual retirement annuity. Effective
as of January 1, 2002, an “eligible retirement plan” includes an
annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b) and an
eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained
by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred
into such plan from this plan. Effective January 1, 2008 an
eligible retirement plan shall include a Roth IRA as that term is
defined in Code Section 408A(b) that agrees to separately
account for amounts transferred from this Plan.

spouse and the Employee's or former Employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section
414(p)(11), are distributees with regard to the interest of the
spouse or former spouse.

accordance with Code Section 457(e)(17), make a trustee-to
trustee transfer from an eligible deferred compensation plan
(as defined in Code Section 457(b)) to this Plan for the
purpose of purchasing service credit (to the extent that such
purchases are permitted under the terms of the Plan) or
repaying a cash-out of contributions refunded under the
Plan.
g. Minimum Required Distributions

this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit
with respect to qualified military service will be provided in
accordance Code Section 414(u).
j. Vesting Upon Plan Termination
(1) Upon the termination of this Plan, or complete discontinuance of
contributions (within the meaning of pre-ERISA Code Section
401(a)(7)) to this Plan, each Employee as of the date of such
termination or discontinuance shall become vested to the extent
that the Plan is funded.
k. Consent for Lump-Sum Distributions
(1) Effective January 1, 2006, notwithstanding any other provision of
the Plan, any distribution to a Participant made prior to the earlier of
age 62 or Normal Retirement Age of an amount in excess of $1,000
that is an eligible rollover distribution as set forth in the Plan and the
Code shall be made only upon consent of the Participant.
l. Non-spousal Rollover
(1) Effective January 1, 2007, the Plan will permit an eligible rollover
distribution from the Plan to an IRA of a non-spouse beneficiary if
such IRA is established in a manner that identifies it as an IRA with
respect to the deceased Participant and meets such other
requirements of the Code.
m. Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Heroes Earnings Assistance
Relief Tax Act (HEART Act)

(3) Section 415(c) Compensation. For the purposes of this Section,
“compensation” includes only those items specified in Treas. Reg.

herein by reference. Effective as of January 1, 2009, to the extent

so maintaining him, and any such payments so made shall be deemed for
every purpose to have been made to such incapacitated person.
c. Employment Rights Not Affected by the Plan: Participation in this Plan

169.02 FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF POLICY
a.) The practice or policy of discrimination against individuals or groups by reason of their
race, color, religious creed, ancestry, handicap or disability, use of guide dogs because of blindness
of the user, age, sex, or national origin, is a matter of concern of the City of Franklin. Such
discrimination foments domestic strife and unrest, threatens the rights and privileges of the
inhabitants of the City of Franklin, and undermines the foundations of free democratic society. The
denial of equal employment, housing and public accommodation opportunities because of such
discrimination, and the consequent failure to utilize the productive capacities of individuals to their
fullest extent, deprives segments of the population of the City of Franklin of earnings necessary to
maintain decent standards of living, necessitates their resort to public relief and intensifies group
conflicts, thereby resulting in grave injury to the public health and welfare, resulting in juvenile
delinquency and other evils, thereby threatening the peace, health, safety and general welfare of the
City of Franklin and its inhabitants.
b.) It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the City of Franklin to foster the
employment of all individuals in accordance with their fullest capacities regardless of their race,
color, religious creed, ancestry, handicap or disability, use of guide dogs because of blindness of
the user, age, sex, or national origin, and to safeguard their right to obtain and hold employment
without such discrimination, to assure equal opportunities to all individuals to secure commercial
housing regardless of race, color, religious creed, ancestry, sex, handicap or disability, use of guide
dogs because of blindness of the user, or national origin.
c.) This Code shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the City of Franklin for
the protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health and peace of the people of the City of
Franklin. (Ord. 3 of 1979, Sect. 3, Passed 3-19-79)

obtain all of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public
accommodation and of commercial housing without discrimination because of race, color, religious
creed, ancestry, handicap or disability, age, sex or national origin are hereby recognized as and
declared to be civil rights which shall be enforceable as set forth in this Code.
b.) The opportunity for an individual to obtain all of the accommodations, advantages,
facilities and privileges of commercial housing without discrimination due to the sex of an individual

a.) Any individual claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful discriminatory practice
may make, sign and file with the Commission a verified complaint, in writing, which shall state the
name and address of the person, employer, labor organization or employment agency alleged to
have committed the unlawful discriminatory practice complained of, and which shall set forth the
particulars thereof and contain such other information as may be required by the Commission. The
Commission, upon its own initiative, may, in like manner, make, sign and file such complaint.
b.) After the filing of any written complaint, or whenever there is reason to believe that an
unlawful discriminatory practice has been committed, the Commission shall make a prompt
investigation in connection therewith. (Ord. 5 of 1981, Sect. 2, Passed 4-6-81)
c.) If it shall be determined after such investigation that no probable cause exists for
crediting the allegations of the complaint, the Commission shall within ten (10) days from such
determination, cause to be issued and served upon the complainant written notice of such
determination, and the said complainant or his attorney may within ten (10) days after such service
file with the Commission a written request for review and the Commission shall provide the
complainant or his attorney an opportunity to appear before the Commission. After such review, the
Commission may reverse its decision, or, if the Commission determines that there is no probable
cause for crediting the allegations of the complaint, the dismissal of the complaint shall be affirmed
and there shall be no further review of such decision.
d.) If the Commission determines after investigation that probable cause exists for
crediting the allegations of the complaint, it may attempt to eliminate the unlawful discriminatory
practice by means of private conferences or meetings with all parties. The Commission shall not
make public any matters relating to efforts to so adjust the complaint.
e.) In any case, the failure to eliminate the unlawful discriminatory practice charged in the
complaint by means of informal proceedings, or in advance thereof, if in the judgment of the
Commission the facts so warrant, the Commission may hold a public hearing to determine whether
or not an unlawful discriminatory practice has been committed or, without holding such hearing,
certify the case to the City Solicitor for prosecution in accordance with Section Thirteen of this Code.
f.) Where public hearing is so ordered, the Commission shall serve upon the person
charged with having engaged in or engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice, hereinafter
referred to as the respondent, a copy of the complaint and any amended complaint and a notice of
the time and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be held not less than ten (10) days after the
service of the complaint upon the respondent. The respondent may file a written, verified answer to
the complaint and appear at such hearing in person or otherwise, with or without counsel, and
submit testimony. The complainant may likewise appear at such hearing in person or otherwise,
with or without counsel, and submit testimony. The Commission or the complainant shall have the
power reasonably and fairly to amend any complaint, and respondent shall have like power to
amend his answer. The Commission shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence prevailing in
courts of law or equity. The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and transcribed.
g.) If, upon all of the evidence presented, the Commission finds that the respondent has
not engaged in any unlawful practice, it shall state its findings of fact and conclusions in writing and
dismiss the complaint. If upon all of the evidence presented, the Commission finds that the
respondent has engaged or is engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice, it shall state its
findings of fact and conclusions in writing and shall issue such order in writing as the facts warrant to
effectuate the purposes of this Code. Such order may require the respondent to cease and desist
from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take such affirmative action, including, but not
being limited to, the hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay,
admission or restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, or selling or leasing
specified commercial housing upon such equal terms and conditions and with such equal facilities,
services or privileges or lending money, whether or not secured by mortgage or otherwise, for the
acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, repair or maintenance of commercial housing, upon such
equal terms or conditions to any person discriminated against or all persons as, in the judgment of
the Commission, will effectuate the purposes of this Code, and including a requirement for report of
the manner of compliance. When the respondent is a licensee of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, the Commission shall inform the appropriate State licensing authority of the order
with the request that the licensing authority take such action as it deems appropriate against such
licensee.
h.) The Commission shall establish rules of practice to govern, expedite and effectuate
the foregoing procedure and its own actions thereunder. Three (3) or more members of the
Commission shall constitute the Commission for any hearing required to be held by the Commission
under this Code. (Ord. 2 of 1986, Sect. 2, Passed 5-19-86)
i.) Any complaint filed pursuant to this Code must be so filed within ninety (90) days after
the alleged act of discrimination. Any complaint may be withdrawn at any time by the party filing the
complaint. (Ord. 3 of 1979, Sect. 10, Passed 3-9-79)
169.10 INJUNCTIONS IN CERTAIN HOUSING COMPLAINTS
When it appears that a housing unit or units involved in a complaint may be sold, rented or
otherwise disposed of before a determination of the case has been made, and the Commission
shows probable cause for the complaint, the Court of Common Pleas of Venango County, upon
application of the Commission, may issue an injunction restraining the sale, rental or other
disposition of the unit or units, except in compliance with the Order of Court. In every such case,
the Court shall grant or deny the injunction within thirty (30) days of the filing of the suit. The Court
may attach to any such injunction granted such other conditions as it deems proper. Such
injunction, if issued, shall be of no more than thirty (30) days duration. If an extension of time is
required by the Commission, the extension may be granted at the discretion of the Court, but a
reasonable bond shall be required by the Court before granting such extension. (Ord. 3 of 1979,
Sect. 11, Passed 3-19-79)
169.11 ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL REVIEW
a.) The complainant or the Commission may secure enforcement of an order of the
Commission or other appropriate relief by the Court of Common Pleas of Venango County,
Pennsylvania. When the Commission has heard and decided any complaint brought before it,
enforcement of its order shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court, together with a
transcript of the record of the hearing before the Commission, and issuance and service of a copy of
said petition as in proceedings in equity. When enforcement of a Commission order is sought, the
court may make and enter, upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings set forth in such
transcript, an order and decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing if so modified, or setting aside, in
whole or in part, the order of the Commission, and the jurisdiction of the court shall not be limited by
acts pertaining to equity jurisdiction of the courts. An appeal may be taken as in other civil actions.
b.) Any failure to obey an Order of the Court may be punished by said Court as a
contempt thereof.
c.) The Commission's copy of the testimony shall be available at all reasonable times to
all parties for examination without cost, and for the purpose of enforcement or judicial review of the
order. The case shall be heard without requirement of printing.

et seq.), he may not subsequently resort to the procedure herein.

(d) All license application, renewal, suspension or revocation decisions shall be
sent in writing to the applicant or licensee. All such decisions, which deny,

requirement not met and any other basis for the decision. After denial of an
application, or denial of a renewal of an application, or after suspension or
revocation of any license, the applicant or licensee may appeal pursuant to

313.01 DEFINITIONS
The following words and phrases, when used in a provision of this Article, unless

d.) "Current Year": The calendar year for which the tax is levied.
e.) "Domicile": The place where one lives and has his permanent home to which
he has the intention of returning whenever he is absent. Actual residence is

place in which a man has voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself and his
family, not for a mere special or limited purpose, but with the present intention
of making a permanent home, until some event occurs to induce him to adopt
some other permanent home. In the case of businesses, or associations, the
domicile is that place considered as the center of business affairs and the
place where its functions are discharged.
f.) "Earned Income": Salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive
payments, fees, tips and other compensation received by a person or his
personal representative for services rendered, whether directly or through an
agent, and whether in case or in property; not including, however, wages or
compensation paid to persons on active military service, periodic payments for
sickness and disability other than regular wages received during a period of
sickness, disability or retirement or payments rising under workmen's
compensation acts, occupational disease acts and similar legislation, or
payments commonly recognized as old age benefits, retirement pay or
pensions paid to persons retired from service after reaching a specific age or
after a stated period of employment or payments commonly known as public
assistance, or unemployment compensation payments made by any
governmental agency or payments to reimburse expenses or payments made
by employers or labor unions for wage and salary supplemental programs,
including, but not limited to, programs covering hospitalization, sickness,
disability or death, supplemental unemployment benefits, strike benefits, social
security and retirement.
g.) "Income Tax Officer or Officer": Person, public employee or private agency
designated by governing body to collect and administer the tax on earned
income and net profits.
h.) "Employer": A person, partnership, association, corporation, institution,
governmental body or unit or agency or any other entity employing one or
more persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.
i.) "Net Profits": The net income from the operation of a business, profession or
other activity, except corporations, after provision for all costs and expenses
incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or accrual basis in
accordance with the accounting system used in such business, profession, or
other activity, but without deduction of taxes based on income.
j.) "Nonresident": A person, partnership, association or other entity domiciled
outside the taxing district.
k.) "Person or Individual": A natural person.
l.) "Preceding year": The calendar year before the current year.
m.) "Resident": A person, partnership, association or other entity domiciled in the
taxing district.
n.) "Succeeding year": The calendar year following the current year.
o.) "Taxpayer": A person, partnership, association or any other entity required
hereunder to file a return of earned income or net profits, or to pay a tax
thereon.

317.04 PROCEDURE TO CLAIM EXEMPTION
(1) An individual seeking to claim an exemption from the tax may annually file
an exemption certificate with the Collector or his designee and with the
individual’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the
corporate limits of the City of Franklin of less than Twelve Thousand and
00/100 ($12,000.00) Dollars in the tax year for which the exemption
certificate is filed. In the event the City of Franklin utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that officer.
The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the
individual’s last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment with the
corporate limits of the City of Franklin for the tax year prior to the tax year
for which the individual is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon
receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
City of Franklin or except as required by Section 317.04(2), the employer
shall not withhold the tax from the individual during the tax year or the
remainder of the tax year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily
available to employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee
with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the City of Franklin.
(2) With respect to an individual who claimed an exemption for a given tax
year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the individual or the
City of Franklin that the individual has received earned income and net
profits from all sources with the corporate limits of the City of Franklin
equal to or in excess of Twelve Thousand and 00/100 ($12,000.00)
Dollars in that tax year or that the individual is otherwise ineligible for the
tax exemption for that tax year, or upon an employer’s payment to the
individual of earned income within the corporate limits of the City of
Franklin in an amount equal to or in excess of Twelve Thousand and
00/100 ($12,000.00) Dollars in that tax year, an employer shall withhold
the tax from the individual under Section 317.04(3).
(3) If an individual who claimed an exemption for a given tax year from the tax
becomes subject to the tax for the tax year under Section 317.04(2), the
employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that tax year. The
employer shall withhold from the individual, for the first payroll period after
receipt of notification under Section 317.04(2), a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the individual due to the
exemption claimed by the individual under this Section, plus the per
payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that tax year shall be
the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of the individual subject to withholding of the tax under this
Section 317.04(3) is subsequently severed in that tax year, the individual
shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the City of
Franklin may pursue collection under this Article.
(4) Except as provided in Section 317.04(2), it is the intent of Section 317.04
that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility, or exempting any
employee from the tax.
317.05 REFUNDS
The City of Franklin, in consultation with the Collector and DCED, shall establish
procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax period by any person who is
eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the
general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on
overpayments. Refunds made with seventy-five (75) days of a refund request or
seventy-five (75) days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the tax year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a tax year that do not exceed One and
00/100 ($1.00) Dollar. The Collector or his designee shall determine the eligibility for
exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
317.06 DUTY OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT
(1) Each employer within the corporate limits of the City of Franklin, as well as
those employers situated outside the corporate limits of the City of
Franklin but who engage in business within the corporate limits of the City
of Franklin, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each
of his employees engaged by him or performing for him within the
corporate limits of the City of Franklin and making a return and payment
thereof to the Collector or his designee. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct the tax for each employee in his employ, whether
said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not
all such services are performed within the corporate limits of the City of
Franklin.
(2) An individual subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rate share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation. The pro rate share of the tax assessed on the
individual for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of
tax levied for the tax year by the number of payroll periods established by
the employer for the tax year. For purposes of determining the pro rate
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest one-hundredths of a dollar. Collection of the
tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which
the individual is engaging in an occupation, except as provided in Section
317.06(4). For purposes of this paragraph, combined rate shall mean the
aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the City
of Franklin.
(3) No individual shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
(4) In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of
the payroll period, and the amount of the tax withheld, and a statement
from the employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal
employer and the employee will notify other employers of the change in
principal place of employment within two (2) weeks of its occurrence. The
employee’s statement shall be provided on a form approved by DCED.
(5) The tax shall be no more than Fifty-Two and 00/100 ($52.00) Dollars on
each individual for each tax year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which an individual may be employed. The City of
Franklin or the Collector or his designee shall provide a taxpayer a receipt
of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
(6) No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the City of Franklin if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee’s place or places of employment, the
employee’s principal office or where the employee is principally employed.
Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the tax in an
amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer
complies with the provisions of Section 317.03 and this section, and remits
the amount so withheld in accordance with this Article.
(7) Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes within thirty
(30) days after the end of each quarter of each tax year.
317.07 RETURNS
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing the computation of the tax
on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector or his designee. If an
employer fails to file the return and pay the local services taxes, whether or not the
employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages, or commissions paid by him
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Article, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the local services taxes in full as though the local
services taxes had been originally levied against the employer.
317.08 DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT
In each tax year, each employer shall use his employment records to determine
the number of employees from whom the tax shall be deducted and paid over to the
Collector or his designee on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each tax year.
317.09 SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment with the
corporate limits of the City of Franklin shall be required to comply with this Article and
pay the pro rate portion of the tax due to the Collector or his designee on or before the
thirtieth (30th) day following the end of each calendar quarter of each tax year.
317.10 INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR
EMPLOYED IN MORE THAN ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION
(1) The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first (1st) day the
individual becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event an
individual is engaged in more than one (1) occupation, that is, concurrent employment,
or an occupation which requires the individual working in more than one (1) political
subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the tax shall be in the
following order:
(a) First, the political subdivision in which the individual maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(b) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; and
(c) Third, the political subdivision in which an individual is employed
and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the individual’s
home.
In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that tax year declaring that the
taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all
other political subdivisions.
317.11 NONRESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places of
business outside of the corporate limits of the City of Franklin but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the corporate limits
of the City of Franklin do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this Article
with the same force and effect as though they were residents of the City of Franklin.
Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the corporate limits of the City
of Franklin and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this
Article, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event his tax is not paid, the
City of Franklin or the Collector or his designee shall have the option of proceeding
against either the employer or employee for the collection of the tax as hereinafter
provided.
317.12 ADMINISTRATION OF TAX

shall have the right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Venango
County, Pennsylvania, as in other cases provided.
(3) The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made

taxes due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
(4) The Collector shall not make refunds in the case of overpayment of the tax
for any period in excess of three (3) years subsequent to the date of
payment of the sum involved.

(30) days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for
the recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this Article, together with
interest and penalty.
(2) If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of Six
(6%) Percent on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with
the due date of the tax and a penalty of Five (5%) Percent shall be added
to flat rate of such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for
the recovery of the tax or other appropriate remedy is undertake, the
individual liable therefore shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for
the costs of collection.
317.14 INTERPRETATION
(1) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to empower the City of Franklin
to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation not within
the taxing power of the City of Franklin under the Constitution of the
United States of America and the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
(2) If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this Article shall be held

Police shall base this decision on various factors, which may
include, without limitation, the size, location, duration, time and date
of the event, the expected sale or service of alcoholic beverages,

personnel will police the event. If additional police protection for the
public assembly is deemed necessary by the Chief of Police, he

location;

the diversion of so great a number of City police officers to
properly police the line of movement and the areas
contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection of
the City;
(3) The concentration of persons, animals, and vehicles at
public assembly points of the parade or public assembly will
not duly interfere with proper fire and police protection of, or
ambulance service to, areas contiguous to such public
assembly areas;
(4) The conduct of the parade or public assembly is not
reasonably likely to cause injury to persons or property;
(5) The parade or public assembly is scheduled to move from its

assembly areas;

of police services would have an immediate and adverse
effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property;
and
(13) No event is scheduled elsewhere in the City where the police
resources required for that event are so great that the
deployment of police services for the proposed parade or
public assembly would have an immediate and adverse
effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property.
(b) No permit shall be granted that allows for the erection or placement
of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a City street,
sidewalk, or right-of-way, unless advance approval for the erection
of placement of the structure is obtained from the City Council.
(c) The Chief of Police may revoke a permit already issued, upon
notification to and approval by the City Manager, if the Chief of
Police deems that such action is justified by an actual or potential
emergency due to weather, fire, riot, other catastrophe, or likelihood
of a breach of the peace, or by a major change in the conditions
forming the basis of the standards of issuance. In lieu of revoking a
permit, the Chief of Police shall require the permittee to file
evidence of good and sufficient sureties, insurance in force, or
other evidence of adequate financial responsibility, running to the
City of Franklin and such third parties as may be injured or

sanitary sewage is recognized. In general, any and all industrial wastes may be discharged to
the public sanitary sewage system except those which are deemed harmful to the system or are
specifically prohibited by these Rules and Regulations. However, it is also recognized that the
treatment of abnormal industrial wastes may add to the cost of operating and maintaining the
public sanitary sewage system. Such additional cost must therefore be borne by the persons
receiving the benefit of such treatment.
b.) The Authority reserves the right to refuse connection to the public sanitary
sewage system for industrial wastes, or to compel discontinuance of flow to the system at point
of connection to he Authority's system for such wastes or to require pretreatment and/or
equalization of flow thereof in order to prevent harmful or adverse effects upon the system.
The design, construction and operation of such pretreatment and/or flow equalization facilities
shall be made at the sole expense of the person discharging said wastes and shall be subject
to the approval of the Authority or its designated representative.
c.) In general, industrial waste shall be considered harmful to the public sanitary
sewage system if it may cause any of the following damaging effects:
1.) Chemical reaction either directly or indirectly with the materials, of
construction of the public sanitary sewage system in such a manner as to impair the strength
or durability of any sewerage structures.
2.) Mechanical action that will destroy any sewerage structures.
3.) Restriction of the hydraulic capacity of any sewerage structures.
4.) Restriction of the normal inspection or maintenance of any sewerage
structures.
5.) Danger to public health and safety.
6.) Obnoxious conditions detrimental to the public interest.
7.) Causes upset or effluent violations at the wastewater treatment works.
d.) Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the enactment of these rules and
regulations, any person discharging or intending to discharge to a public sewer any industrial

manholes or metering chamber on his building sewer or sewers to facilitate observation,
sampling and measurement of the combined flow or wastes from his premises. Such manhole
or manholes or metering chamber shall be accessible and safely located and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Municipality. The manhole or manholes
or metering chamber shall be installed by such person at his expense and shall be maintained
by him so as to be safe and accessible to the Authority and the Municipality at all times. The
construction and maintenance of such manhole or metering chamber shall be mandatory for
the producers of industrial wastes, and if deemed necessary by the Authority, flows from such
manhole or metering chamber shall be continuously monitored, transmitted an recorded by
means of an approved receiving device to be located at the treatment plant.
e.) Within ninety (90) days of enactment of these rules and regulations, any person
discharging industrial waste to a public sewer shall so notify the Municipality.
f.) Effective thirty (30) days from the date of enactment of these rules and
regulations any person who intends to initiate or modify the discharge of industrial wastes to a
public sewer shall so notify the Municipality and provide information relating to the composition
of the discharge as the Municipality may require.
g.) A person discharging or intending to discharge industrial waste to a public sewer
shall provide such information as may be required for the Municipality to determine if such
discharge is allowable and what charges should be imposed, as well as comply with the
application procedure specified for new connections.
914.05 UNACCEPTABLE - SEWAGE & WASTE
a.) The discharge of excessive amounts of unpolluted water or waste to a sanitary
sewer is expressly prohibited. However, such discharges to storm sewers will be permitted
wherever such sewers are of adequate capacity. The Authority reserves the right to define the
amount it deems excessive in each particular instance.
b.) The discharge of garbage to the public sanitary sewage system is expressly
prohibited unless the garbage is first properly shredded.
c.) Within the time limits specified, existing discharges, modifications of discharge, or
intentions to discharge shall be reported as specified in ARTICLE IV.
d.) No person shall discharge to the public sanitary sewage system any sanitary
sewage or industrial wastes having any of the following characteristics.
1.) Wastes containing liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature
or quality may cause fire, explosions, or be in any other way injurious to persons, the structures
of the public sanitary sewage system or its operation.
2.) Wastes having a temperature in excess of 150°F. or less than 32°F.
3.) Wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 9.0 or having any
corrosive properties capable of causing damage or hazards to structures, equipment or
personnel of the public sanitary sewage system. Where the Authority or Municipality deems it
advisable, they may require any person discharging industrial wastes to install and maintain, at
his own expense, in a manner approved by the Authority or its designated representative, a
suitable device to continuously measure and record the pH of the wastes so discharged.
4.) Wastes containing any noxious or malodorous gas or substance which
either singly or by interaction with sewage or other wastes is, in the opinion of the Authority or

glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, hair, chemical or paint residues, greases, lime slurry or
viscose materials of such character or in such quantity that, in the opinion of the Authority or the
Municipality, they may cause an obstruction to the flow in the sewers or otherwise interfere with
the proper operations of the public sanitary sewage system. Attention is called to the fact that
the maximum permissible concentration will vary throughout the public sanitary sewage system
depending upon the size of the particular interceptor sewer receiving the same and the flows
therein.
6.) Waste containing insoluble, non flocculent substances having a specific
gravity in excess of2.65.
7.) Wastes containing soluble substances in such concentration as to cause
the specific gravity of the waste to be greater than 1.1.

allowed by Article VII.
914.06 CHARGES
a.) There is imposed upon the owners of, or the users of water in or on, all properties
served by the public sanitary sewage system, sewage collection, transportation and treatment
charges for the use of said system, payable in the amounts and as provided in the Sewer Rate
Resolution heretofore adopted by the Municipality and as it is hereinafter from time to time
amended and modified. Said owners and users will be jointly and severally liable for the
payment of said sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges and the penalties
therein prescribed for delinquent payments thereof.
b.) All bills for sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges shall be due
when rendered and shall be subject to the penalty provisions set forth in the Municipality's
Sewer Rate Resolution. Owners and, where adequate arrangements have been made with the
Municipality, users will be billed periodically for the sewage collection, transportation and
treatment charges in accordance with the billing practices of the Municipality.
c.) When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then if an owner obtains part
or all of the water used in or on a property from sources other than the public water supply,
such owner or user may, after written approval from the Authority, at no expense to the
Authority, the Municipality, or the Water Supplier, install and maintain a water meter or meters
satisfactory to the Authority and the Municipality and the Water Supplier for measuring all water
used other than that obtained from the public water supply and the quantity of water used to
determine the sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges shall be the quantity of
water measured by all such meters plus the quantity of water obtained from the Water Supplier.
In lieu of such additional meters, the Municipality may establish under the Sewer Rate
Resolution a flat rate charge which shall be applicable to such non-metered water usage.
d.) When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then if it is established to the
satisfaction of the Authority that a portion of the water used in or on any property served by the
public sanitary sewage system does not and cannot enter said system, and in the event that the
total water used in or on said property exceeds 100,000 gallons per quarter, the Authority may
determine, in such manner and by such method as it may deem practical, the percentage of the
water entering the public sanitary sewage system, or the Authority may require or permit the
installation of additional meters in such manner as to determine either the quantity of water
excluded from the public sanitary sewage system or the quantity of water, sewage or industrial
waste actually entering the public sanitary sewage system, exclusive of storm water runoff. In
such case, these wage collection, transportation and treatment charge shall be based upon the
quantity of water estimated, measured or computed by the Authority to be actually entering the
public sanitary sewage system, exclusive of storm water runoff.
e.) When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then any person requesting
consideration for a reduction of the amount of the sewage collection, transportation and
treatment charges because of water not entering the public sanitary sewage system shall make
written application to the Authority for such consideration, giving the name of such person, his
address and setting forth supporting data fully describing other sources of water, if any, as well
as the disposition of water alleged not to be entering the public sanitary sewage system. The
application shall be accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale showing the plan of the
property, the water distribution system, sewer layout, existing meters, and proposed meters in
the scheme to determine the quantity of flow entering, or not entering, the public sanitary
sewage system. The cost of furnishing, installing and maintaining any meters other than those
utilized to measure water purchased from the public water supply shall be borne by the
applicant. The type, size, location, arrangement and maintenance of such meters shall be
subject to the approval of the Authority.
914.07 SURCHARGE FOR INDUSTRIAL WASTES
a.) Although the sewage treatment works will be capable of treating certain abnormal
industrial wastes as heretofore defined in Article I, the actual treatment of such wastes may
increase the cost of operating and maintaining the public sanitary sewage system. Therefore,
there will be imposed upon each person discharging such industrial waste into a public sewer a
surcharge, or surcharges, which are intended to cover such additional cost. Such surcharges
shall be in addition to the regular sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges set
forth in the Sewer Rate Resolution of the Municipality, and shall be payable as therein provided.
b.) The strength of any industrial waste, the discharge of which is to be subject to
surcharge, shall be determined monthly, or more frequently as the Municipality shall determine,
from samples taken either at the manhole or metering chamber referred to in Article IV hereof,
or at any other sampling point mutually agreed upon by the Municipality and the producer of
such waste. The frequency and duration of the sampling period shall be such as, in the opinion
of the Municipality will permit a reasonably reliable determination of the average composition of
such waste, exclusive of storm water runoff. Samples shall be collected or their collection
supervised by a representative of the Municipality and shall be in proportion to the flow of
waste, exclusive of storm water runoff, and composited for analysis in accordance with the
latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater", cited
above. Except as hereinafter provided, the strength of the waste so found by analysis shall be
used for establishing the surcharge or surcharges. However, the Municipality may, if it so
elects, accept the results of routine sampling and analyses by the producer of such wastes in
lieu of making its own samplings and analyses.
c.) In the event any industrial waste is found, by the Municipality to have a B.O.D. in
excess of 300 milligrams per liter, the producer of said waste shall be surcharged an amount
equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in thousand gallons per billing period,
exclusive of storm water runoff, discharged to the public sanitary sewage system and the
"B.O.D. surcharge rate". The "B.O.D. surcharge rate" shall be determined by the following
formula:
Rc = 0.00834 P (C-300)
Where Rc = the B.O.D. surcharge rate in cents per 1,000 gallons of waste discharged.
P = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost of secondary treatment
processes per pound of B.O.D. received at the treatment works. (Prior to
completion of the first year of operation the value of "P" shall be assumed to be
four (4) cents).
C = the average B.O.D. of the industrial waste expressed in milligrams per liter as
determined in accordance with Section 702 of this Article.
The figure 300 appearing in the above formula corresponds to the maximum B.O.D.
permissible without surcharge. The figure 0.00834 is the factor to convert milligrams per liter to
pound per 1,000 gallons. No discount will be permitted for sewage or industrial wastes having
a B.O.D. less than 300 milligrams per liter.
d.) In the event any industrial waste is found, by the Municipality to have an average
suspended solids concentration in excess of 350 milligrams per liter, the producer of such
waste shall be surcharged an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in
thousand gallons per billing period, exclusive of storm runoff, discharged to the public sanitary
sewage system and the "suspended solids surcharge rate". The "suspended solids surcharge
rate" shall be determined by the following formula:
R
s
= 0.00834 x B (S-350)
Where R
s
= the suspended solids surcharge rate in cents per 1,000 gallons of waste
discharged.
B = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost of the sludge digestion,
sludge drying and sludge disposal operations per pound of suspended solids
received at the treatment works. (Prior to completion of the first year of operation
the value of "B" shall be assumed to be four (4) cents).
S = the average suspended solids concentration of the abnormal industrial waste
expressed in milligrams per liter as determined in accordance with Section 702 of
this Article.
The figure 350 appearing in the above formula correspond to the maximum suspended solids
concentration permissible without surcharge. The figure 0.00834 is the factor to convert
milligrams per liter to pounds per 1,000 gallons. No discount will be permitted for sewage or
industrial wastes having a suspended solids concentration less than 350 milligrams per liter.
e.) The surcharges provided for in this Article shall be added to the sewage
collection, transportation and treatment charges imposed by the Municipality under the Sewer
Rate Resolution.
914.08 BILLING AND COLLECTION
a.) Bills and notices relating to the sewage collection, transportation and treatment
charges and surcharges will be mailed or delivered to the property owner's last address, or
where proper arrangements have been made with the Municipality, to the user's last address,
as shown on the billing books to he Municipality.
914.09 CONNECTIONS

payment of the tapping fees for the appropriate number of actual units served will be permitted
to serve a school, factory, apartment house or other permanent multiple unit structure whose
individual apartments or units may not be subject to separate ownership.
f.) Connections to sanitary and combined sewers shall be completed within sixty (60)
calendar days after receipt of proper notice.
g.) All connections to the sanitary or combined sewers shall be subject to certain
restrictions as to unacceptable sewage which are set forth herein in Article V.
h.) The Municipality's designated Inspector shall be given at least 24 hours notice
before any connection is made to the system so that the Inspector can be present to inspect
and approve the work of building the sewer and connection. The Inspector shall signify his
approval to the connection by endorsing his name and the date of approval on the
aforementioned connection permit in the possession of the permittee. The Inspector shall be

sanitary sewer.
o.) Industrial installations must also comply with all local construction regulations.
p.) Maintenance and repair of all building sewers shall be the responsibility of the
property owner.
q.) Old building sewers may be used to connect existing buildings to the sewer
system only when the Municipality's representative determines the old sewer is in an
acceptable condition. The condition of the existing building sewer will be determined in the
following manner: A 6-inch diameter vertical riser shall be constructed by the property owner at
his expense. The riser shall be located at the point where the existing sewer connects to the
public sewer system. Flow in the existing line will be observed in the riser and determination of
the condition of the existing line made. If flow observed is excessive, indicating infiltration, the
line will be rejected. Otherwise it will be accepted. If rejected, the owner of the property shall
install a new building sewer to comply with these Rules and Regulations.

The purpose of this Article is to establish procedures for the control of industrial
wastes discharged to the City of Franklin sewage system. It is hereby declared that the
enactment of this Article is necessary for the proper operation of the City of Franklin sewage
treatment plant and to comply with the Clean Streams Law of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. (Ord. 7 of 1973, Sect. 1, Passed 3-5-73)
915.02 DEFINITIONS
Unless the context specifically and clearly indicates otherwise, the meanings of terms
used in this Article shall be as follows:
a.) General Authority: The General Authority of the City of Franklin, a
Pennsylvania Municipal Authority.
b.) Industry: A manufacturing firm producing a product, as distinct from a
commercial or residential establishment.
c.) Industrial Waste: The liquid waste from industrial processes, as distinct from
domestic or sanitary wastes.
d.) Engineer: The General Authority Engineer, or any registered Professional
Engineer designated by the General Authority of the City of Franklin to perform
the duties of Engineer on behalf of the General Authority.
e.) Treatment Plant: The sewage treatment plant, owned and operated by the
General Authority.
(Ord. 7 of 1973, Sect. 2, Passed 3-5-73)
915.03 GENERAL
The waste delivered to the treatment plant by any industry shall be within the
maximum limits presented below or pretreated to within the limits of Section 915.06. (Ord. 7
of 1973, Sect. 3, Passed 3-5-73)
915.04 ACCEPTABILITY STANDARDS
The General Authority shall, from time to time, establish acceptability standards for
sewage and industrial waste entering into its collection system from any industry which
discharges sewage (directly or indirectly) to the Treatment Plant for the purpose of
prohibiting materials or characteristics which would be deleterious to the Franklin Sewage
Treatment Plant or the treatment process, which standards shall be reasonable and similar
to standards imposed with regard to similar facilities. No industry shall permit discharge
directly or indirectly to the treatment plant of any sewage or waste so certified to be
deleterious, but such certification shall not preclude the industry from contesting the
reasonableness of such determination. (Ord. 7 of 1973, Sect. 4, Passed 3-5-73)
915.05 SAMPLING MANHOLES
For the purpose of determining the characteristics of sewage or wastes, the General
Authority shall install or cause to be installed a sampling manhole at the point of discharge
at the property of any user which the Engineer considers capable of discharging sewage or
wastes not meeting any of such acceptability standards. (Ord. 7 of 1973, Sect. 5, Passed 3-
5-73)
915.06 INDUSTRIAL WASTES
In order to control admission of industrial wastes, no industrial user shall be permitted
to connect to or discharge into the collection system any waters or wastes other than
sanitary waste without the prior review and approval of the Engineer. The Engineer's review
(until such time as the following acceptability standards are amended in accordance with
Section 915.04 hereof) shall be based on, but not limited to, the following standards:
Characteristics of the industrial waste shall not be in general in excess of those listed
below:
a.) The 5-day 20º centigrade B.O.D. (bio-chemical oxygen demand) shall not
exceed 200 ppm.
b.) The suspended solids content shall not exceed 250 ppm.
c.) Total solids content shall not exceed 1,100 ppm.
d.) The pH shall not be less than 6.0 nor shall it exceed 9.0.
e.) The temperature shall not exceed 150º F.
f.) The waste shall not contain any material requiring unusual processing or
expense at the Treatment Plant.
g.) The color shall not be such as to require special treatment to render the
effluent acceptable for discharge into the Allegheny River.
h.) The waste shall not contain grease and oil, inflammable material, nonbiodegradable
material or any oxygen scavenger, sufficient in quantity to be
injurious to the Treatment Plant or interfere with any treatment process or to
constitute a hazard to human or animal life.
i.) The waste shall not contain any other solid or viscous material capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in the sewer or at the Treatment Plant or any
material capable of causing interference with the proper operation of the
Treatment Plant.
Where required, in the opinion of the Engineer, the user shall provide at his expense
such preliminary treatment or handling as may be necessary to modify the objectionable
characteristics or control the quantities and rates of discharge of such water or wastes as
necessary. This will also apply to waste which may not be deleterious but which may cause
significant operating expense to the Treatment Plant. Plans, specifications, and any other
pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment or handling facilities shall be
submitted for review to the General Authority and no construction of such facilities shall be
commenced until a permit for the connection is obtained in writing from the General
Authority.
In order to insure quality compliance and to reduce the possibility of accidental
discharges of wastes not conforming, each industry shall sample, test or otherwise examine
industrial wastes as often as is reasonably necessary to insure quality compliance.
(Ord. 7 of 1973, Sect. 6, Passed 3-5-73)
915.07 COMBINED SEWAGE AND INDUSTRIAL WASTES
In order to control the sewage entering the Treatment Plant, the General Authority will
sample the discharge from each industry periodically to insure that no characteristic is
evident which would be deleterious to the Treatment Plant or the treatment process. The
characteristics of each combined sewage and industrial waste discharge shall not be in
excess of those listed under Section 915.06, except that the temperature of the combined
discharge shall not exceed 100º F.
Should the General Authority find either the BOD or suspended solids characteristics
exceeded as determined in the tests on the periodically obtained samples, the potentially
offending industry shall be notified of the findings and requested to examine the conditions.
If, at the end of a quarter, the General Authority determines that the discharge from the
industry is in excess of the characteristics as determined by average test results by periodic
sampling, the suspected offender shall be given written notice that its discharge is in excess
and that a comprehensive sampling and testing program will be undertaken by the General
Authority to verify the non-compliance and to notify that steps should be taken to rectify the
problem. If, at the end of the quarterly comprehensive test program, the problem has not
been rectified, a penalty charge as provided in Section 915.99 will be added to that quarter's
billing and until the situation is shown to be corrected.
Should the General Authority find any other additional characteristics to be in excess
or to find the presence of any other untested deleterious material in the course of periodic
sampling and testing, the potential offending industry shall be given notice to take
immediate steps to rectify the problem.
(Ord. 7 of 1973, Sect. 7, Passed 3-5-73)
915.99 PENALTY
A penalty charge will be added to the quarterly billing of any industry in violation as
described in Section 915.07, based on deviations in excess of 200 ppm. of 5-day 20 degree
centigrade B.O.D. and 250 ppm. suspended solids content. The penalty charge will consist
of a multiplier factor applied to the quarterly volume. The multiplier will be determined as
follows:
BOD5 - 200 (Suspended Solids - 250)
Multiplier = 1.00 + 1000 + 1000
Any member of the formula giving a negative value shall be disregarded. BOD5 and
suspended solids figures shall be the average over a quarterly period based on analyses
taken five (5) per week. The method of analyses shall be as described in the most recent
edition of "Standard Methods of Analyses of Water and Wastewater." (Ord. 7 of 1973, Sect.
8, Passed 3-5-73)

1303.01 ZONING MAP
A map entitled the City of Franklin Zoning Map is hereby adopted as part of this
Ordinance. The Zoning Map shall be kept on file and be available for examination at the
City offices.
1303.02 ZONING DISTRICTS
The City is divided into the districts set forth by this Ordinance and as shown by the
district boundaries on the Zoning Map. The districts are:
(a) Residential Districts: Districts designated for residential use are for dwelling
units and uses normally associated with residential neighborhoods. The
specific purpose for each of the residential districts is as follows:
(1) R-1 Single-Family Residential District: The purpose of this district is to
create and encourage the preservation, construction and maintenance
of desirable residential neighborhoods and to protect and stabilize
property values. These zones are for single family dwellings and
related uses.
(2) R-2 Medium Density Residential District: The purpose of this district is
to relax the restrictiveness of the single family zone without losing the
desirable characteristics of residential neighborhoods, to provide for
two-family dwelling units, apartment houses, and non-detrimental home
occupations.
(3) R-3 High Density Residential District: The purpose of this district is to
provide for increased density in housing, including apartment houses
and multiple unit dwellings, and to provide desirable areas for business
and financial services and home occupations while still maintaining the
desirable neighborhood characteristics specified to appeal to those
with small families or older couples.
(b) TRC - Transitional Residential Commercial District: This zone is designed to
permit a variety of residential and limited business uses in the City. Its
purpose is to afford limited commercial activities which are amenable to
residential uses while preserving the character of an established residential
area.
(c) Commercial District: The Commercial Districts are designed to provide for
needed commercial and related activities within the City.
(1) CBD Central Business District: This district is specifically designed for
the existing Franklin central business district. It allows for a wide range
of commercial and related uses mixed with multiple unit dwellings while
recognizing the physical limitations of this already built-up area. Most
off-street parking and loading/unloading requirements are eliminated
for this zone.
(2) C-1 Commercial Business District: This district is designed to
accommodate a wide range of commercial, residential and related
uses.
(d) IN Industrial District: Industrial Districts are created to encourage the
development and operation of industrial establishments without undue hazard
or detriment to adjacent properties or to the community as well as the
protection of such industrial area from detrimental encroachment by
residential and/or other uses incompatible with industrial development.
1303.03 ANNEXED AREAS
Any territory hereafter annexed by the City will be automatically zoned a R-1 Single-
Family Residential District, until otherwise classified by the City.
1303.04 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
District boundaries that are shown between the lines of streets, streams, and
transportation right-of-ways shall be deemed to follow the centerlines. The vacation of
streets shall not affect the locations of such district boundaries. When the Zoning Officer
cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary by such centerlines, by the
scale or dimensions stated on the Zoning Map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a
property line, he shall refuse action, and the Zoning Hearing Board, upon appeal, shall
interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the Zoning Map
and the purpose set forth in all relevant provisions of this Ordinance.
1303.05 ZONING DISTRICT CHANGES
All approved changes to Zoning Districts shall be promptly recorded on the Zoning
Map by the Zoning Officer.
1303.06 PERMITTED USES
The Permitted Uses for each district are shown in Tables 1303.06a through
1303.06g. Uses in each district shall be according to the common meaning of the term or

1306.01 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses and structures. It is
the intention of the City that all legal nonconforming uses and structures shall be able to
continue; however, all changes in such uses shall only be as allowed in this Article;
provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing part of this section, any residential use in
a Commercial District (C-1), Central Business District (CBD), or Industrial District (IN) may
make such structural additions, alternations, or changes as are permitted in an R-3
Residential District.
(a) A structure or use legally established prior to the adoption of this Ordinance
may be maintained unchanged. In other than criminal proceedings, the
owner, occupant or user shall have the burden to show when and how the
structure or use was lawfully established.
(b) Maintenance, repairs and structural alterations shall be permitted to be made
to nonconforming structures or to a building housing a nonconforming use
with valid permits.
(c) A change of use of a nonconforming use of a structure or lot shall not be
made except to that of a conforming use. Where such change is made, the
use shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use. The
nonconforming use of a structure or lot may be expanded throughout those
parts thereof which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of the adoption of this Ordinance. Any request to not provide off-street
parking and loading required for the use in the zoning district shall require
approval of the Zoning Hearing Board.
(d) A nonconforming structure may be expanded, enlarged, and/or replaced if
such expansion, enlargement, and/or replacement does not occupy an area
greater than fifty (50%) percent more than the structure occupied, at the time
of the adoption of this Ordinance, prior to such expansion, enlargement,
and/or replacement, and does not intrude into the required rear, side, and/or
front yard areas for the zoning district. Any intrusion(s) into the required rear,
side, and/or front yard areas, or height above the zoning district’s height
limitation, shall require approval of the Zoning Hearing Board, unless (1) said
intrusion(s) does not encroach further towards the property line than the
existing, nonconforming structure, and (2) has the written permission of the
property owners who are adjacent to the proposed rear, side, and/or front
yard intrusion(s) or height above the maximum height. As used in this
section, the term “adjacent” property owners does not include property owners
located across a public street or a public right-of-way from the nonconforming
structure.
(e) Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall layout, plans,
construction, size or designated use of any development, building, structure or
part thereof for which official approval and required permits have been
granted prior to the effective date of this Ordinance and where construction is
started within six (6) months from the date of issuance of the permit.
(f) Any nonconforming structure which has been damaged or destroyed by fire or
any other means may be reconstructed and used as before, if such
reconstruction commences within one (1) year of such damage and if the
restored structure covers no greater area and contains no greater cubic
content. If approved by the Board, a reconstructed structure may exceed its
original lot coverage and cubic content, but must meet the minimum yard
requirements of the district in which the structure is located, and it must meet
the off-street parking and loading requirements of this Ordinance.
(g) Any lot or structure, or portion thereof, occupied by a nonconforming use,
which is or hereafter becomes vacant and remains unoccupied by a
nonconforming use for a period of one (1) year shall not thereafter be
occupied, except by a use that conforms to this Ordinance.
(h) Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer an
area from one district to another of a different classification, this Ordinance
shall also apply to any uses or structures which thereby become
nonconforming.
1306.02 EXISTING LOTS OF RECORD
Any lot of record existing at the effective date of this Ordinance, and held in separate
ownership different from the ownership of adjoining lots, may be used for the erection of a
structure conforming to the use regulations of the district in which it is located, even though
its lot area and width are less than the minimum required by this Ordinance; however, such
lot must comply with the yard, height and coverage standards of the zoning district wherein
it is located. Any multiple unit dwelling must meet the appropriate density standards of the
zoning district. Where two (2) or more adjacent lots of record with less than the required
area and width are held by one (1) owner, on or before the effective date of this Ordinance,
the request for a permit shall be referred to the Zoning Hearing Board, which may require
replatting to fewer lots, which would comply with the minimum requirements of this
Ordinance.
Furthermore, the size of any existing lot of record shall not be reduced so that the
area or dimensions of the lot are smaller than those required by this Ordinance. However,
if adjacent lots are redefined, there shall be no net increase of nonconforming lots.
1306.03 APPLICATION OF YARD REGULATIONS
(a) Where a structure exists on an adjacent lot and is within one hundred fifty
(150) feet of the proposed structure, and the existing structure has a front
yard less than the minimum depth required, the minimum front yard shall be
the average depth of the front yard of the existing structure on the adjacent lot
and the minimum depth required for the district. Where structures exist on
both adjacent lots, the minimum depth of the front yard shall be the average
depth of the front yards of the existing adjacent structures.
(b) All structures, whether attached to the principal structure or not, and whether
open or enclosed, including porches, carports, balconies or platforms above
normal grade level, shall not project into any minimum front, side or rear yards
except as follows:
(1) Eaves, cornices or other similar architectural features shall be
permitted to project into a required yard no more than eighteen (18)
inches.
(2) Ramps, porches, platforms or landings, whether or not covered by a
roof or enclosed, shall be permitted to extend no more than six (6) feet
into the required front or rear yard provided such porch does not
extend above the first story and is no more than six (6) feet above
grade at any point.
(3) Chimneys shall be permitted to project no more than two (2) feet into a
required yard, provided the width of any side yard is not reduced to
less than thirty (30) inches.
(4) Bay windows and balconies shall be permitted to project no more than
two (2) feet into a required yard.
(5) Accessory structures shall occupy the same lot as the main use or
building. Except as otherwise set forth in this Article, accessory
structures shall be permitted in rear yards. Accessory structures shall
be at least five (5) feet from the main use or building, and three (3) feet
from side or rear lines. If a side lot line is along a street, the accessory
structure shall observe the required setback, but in no event shall be
closer than ten (10) feet to a street.
(6) An accessory structure used as a private garage shall be permitted to
be located in the rear or side yard provided that it is located at least five
(5) feet from the main use or building, and setbacks are maintained,
and the structure does not encroach into any recorded easements.
The accessory structure shall be permitted to be located in the front
yard of a sloping lot if the lot has more than ten (10) foot difference in
elevation from midpoint of the front lot line to a point fifty (50) feet away
midway between the side lot lines.
(7) All accessory structures used for storage or other similar use shall be
permitted to be located in the rear yard or side yard provided that the
accessory structure complies with the provisions of Article
1306.03(b)(5). No storage building shall be located in the front yard.
(8) A wall or fence under six (6) feet, six (6) inches in height, and paved
terraces without walls, roofs, or other enclosures, may be erected
within the limits of any yard. A fence may be permitted in a front yard
area as long as the fence is no higher than three (3) feet and does not
obstruct the required sight line at intersections.
(9) Private swimming pools shall be permitted in rear yards only, provided
that the pool is located not less than ten (10) feet from any side yard
line, and ten (10) feet from the rear yard line. All swimming pools shall
be enclosed by a fence in accordance with applicable law and
ordinances.
(c) Through lots shall follow existing development patterns. Where other through
lots exist nearby, the orientation of development (designation of front and rear
yard) shall follow existing usage. Where no other through lots exist nearby,
both frontages shall be considered front yards.
(d) For corner lots, the short frontage shall be considered the front yard, and the
long frontage shall be considered a side yard. Where frontage measurements
are equal the dominant orientation of surrounding properties shall determine
the front yard. Corner lots shall be required to increase lot width by twenty
(20) percent.
(e) Lot width shall be measured at the building line; however, the width at the
front lot line shall be no less than fifty (50) percent of the minimum lot width as
set forth by Table 1303.07a.
1306.04 LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS
(a) Landscaping is required for all new buildings and additions over five hundred
(500) square feet as defined in this Section. Said landscaping shall be
completed within one (1) year from the date of occupancy of the building.
(b) Front yards shall be completely landscaped, except for those areas occupied
by utilities, access driveways, paved walks, walls and structures.
(c) All flanking street-side side yards shall be completely landscaped, except for
those area occupied by utilities, access driveways, paved walks, walls and
structures.
(d) All live landscaping required by this Ordinance shall be properly maintained.
All dead or dying landscaping shall be replaced immediately and all sodded
areas mowed, fertilized and irrigated on a regular basis.
(e) All live landscaping shall not obstruct the required sight lines at intersections.
1306.05 TEMPORARY USES
Temporary uses in conjunction with construction work shall be permitted only during
the period that the construction work is in progress. Permits for temporary uses shall be
issued for no more than a six (6) month period. Temporary uses shall not be used for
residential purposes other than sanitation.
1306.06 HEIGHT LIMITATIONS
When the following conditions are met, height limits may be increased:
(a) Structure height, in excess of the height permitted above grade allowed in any
district, may be increased, provided all minimum front, side and rear yard
depths are increased by one (1) foot for each additional foot of height;
however, such increase of height shall be limited to no more than ten (10)
additional feet.
(b) The following structures are exempt from height regulations provided they do
not constitute a hazard: cellular antenna towers and telecommunications
facilities, church spires, chimneys, elevator bulk heads, smoke stacks,
conveyors, flag poles, silos, standpipes, elevated water tanks, small wind
energy systems, derricks and similar structures. Satellite dish antennae,
telecommunications towers and facilities, and small wind energy systems are
covered by separate sections of this Ordinance. Regardless of any other
provision of this Ordinance, the height of any structure shall comply with the
Franklin Airport Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 4 of 2016, Sect. 4, Passed Finally
08-01-2016)
1306.07 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
No use of land or structure in any district shall involve any element, or cause any
condition, that may be dangerous, injurious or noxious to any other property or person in
the City. The following performance standards must be met in all districts.
(a) Fire Protection: All uses shall comply with applicable regulations set forth in
the Franklin Fire Prevention Code.
(b) Electric Disturbance: All sources of electromagnetic radiation shall
demonstrate compliance with applicable regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). No activity shall cause electromagnetic
interference adversely affecting radio, television or other communication
equipment in the neighboring area. For the purpose of these regulations,
electromagnetic interference shall be defined as electromagnetic disturbances
which are generated by the use of electrical equipment, other than planned
and intentional sources of electromagnetic energy, which interfere with the
proper operation of electromagnetic receptors of proper design.
(c) Noise: Noise which is determined to be objectionable because of volume or
frequency shall be muffled or otherwise controlled, except for fire sirens and
related apparatus used solely for public safety purposes.
(d) Air Pollution and Smoke: All uses shall comply with applicable regulations set
forth by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP).
(e) Odors: In any district, except the Industrial District, no malodorous or harmful
gas or matter shall be permitted which is discernible on any adjoining lot or
property.
(f) Glare and Light Trespass: Luminaries which cause noticeably reduced vision
or momentary blindness on adjoining properties or public roads shall not be
permitted. New and replacement luminaries rated at 1,800 lumens or more
shall be of a fully shielded design, and shall be positioned so as to avoid light
trespass to adjoining properties and public roads. Exceptions to these
requirements are as follows:
(1) Luminaries or temporary lights required for emergency situations and
public safety purposes;
(2) Luminaries for special requirements, such as sports facilities, the flag
of the United States of America and monuments; however, all such
luminaries shall be selected and installed to shield the luminaries to
minimize light trespass;
(3) Luminaries which fulfill a compelling safety or emergency interest
which cannot be addressed by any other method, for example, airport
beacons, police spotlights, police, fire, and emergency vehicle lights,
and vehicle headlights.
(g) Erosion: No erosion by wind or water shall be permitted which carries
objectionable substances onto neighboring properties.
(h) Water Pollution: The discharge of all wastewater shall be in accordance with
the applicable regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the City. Surface water discharge shall
be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and the City.
(i) Vibration: No vibration shall be produced which is transmitted through the
ground and is discernable without the aid of instruments at any point beyond
the lot line.
1306.08 OFF-STREET LOADING AND PARKING AND DRIVEWAYS
(a) A person shall first obtain a zoning permit from the Zoning Officer before
making any cut in or alteration of a curb, or constructing or installing any
driveway or parking lot or off-street parking space. If the driveway abuts a
federal or state highway or route, the applicant must also obtain a permit from
the appropriate state agency.
(b) No person shall construct or install, or permit to be constructed or installed,
any driveway or parking lot or parking space, except in conformity with this
Ordinance.
(c) No off-street parking space, other than a driveway, shall be installed or
constructed within any public street right-of-way.
(d) A driveway shall extend from the public way onto the subject abutting lot on a
line generally perpendicular to the nearer lateral street line and shall, in no
case, extend less than twenty (20) feet from the nearest street line except
where the driveway leads into a garage structure permitted under the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Franklin. See Figures 1306.08.1 and 1306.08.2.
Parking in a driveway shall not obstruct any kind of sidewalk or roadway.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the grade from the public way to the
abutting lot line is ten (10) percent or more, an applicant shall apply to the
Zoning Officer for approval of a plan for the driveway, not generally
perpendicular to the street line, which permits construction and installation of
a driveway without hazard to traffic operation on the public way or from the
driveway onto the public way. If the Zoning Officer refuses or fails within
fourteen (14) business days from the date of an application to approve the
plan (which approval, if any shall be in writing and filed with the application for
a zoning permit), the applicant shall have the right to apply to the Board for a
variance. The Board may grant a variance for a driveway not generally
perpendicular to the nearer street line, so long as the plan provides for
entrance and exit from the driveway in a manner consistent with the public
safety and, in particular, for the operation of motor vehicles on and along the
public way and at the approach to the junction of the said driveway and public
way and from the driveway onto the public way.
(e) Driveways extending onto lots abutting the public way shall be located so as
to extend onto the side of a main building on a lot if at least twelve (12) feet
are available measured from said main building to the adjacent side line of the
lot; provided, however, a driveway may extend to a garage door of a private
garage rather than to the side of said main building.
See Figures 1306.08.1 and 1306.08.2. No driveway shall be permitted to extend
onto a lot other than at the side of a main building, except as heretofore provided.
No parking space shall be installed or constructed on that portion of a lot between
the nearest part of a main building in residential districts, excluding the TRC
district, and the nearest street line generally parallel thereto.

(f) Driveways in TRC and residential districts shall not be constructed or maintained
less than twelve (12) feet in width and shall not exceed twenty-two (22) feet in
width in the area between the abutting lot line and the nearest street line, except
within four (4) feet thereof and shall not exceed ten (10) additional feet in width at
the street line. See Figures 1306.08.1 and 1306.08.2. There shall be at least five
(5) feet between a driveway flare, or driveway if no flare, and a fire hydrant.
(g) Driveways in commercial or industrial districts shall not be constructed or
maintained less than twelve (12) feet in width and shall not exceed twenty-four
(24) feet in width in the area between the abutting lot line and the nearest street
line, except within four (4) feet thereof and shall not exceed fifteen (15) additional
feet in width at the street line. See Figures 1306.08.1 and 1306.08.2.
(h) Parking areas in the C-1 Commercial and IN Industrial Districts shall be permitted
anywhere on the lot, but must comply with the Screening and Landscaping
requirements listed in this Ordinance.
(i) In a TRC and residential districts, no one lot shall be permitted more than one (1)
driveway from a public way, except where the lot is bounded by two or more
public ways, then one (1) driveway shall be permitted for each public way.
(j) In C-1 Commercial and IN Industrial Districts, no more than one (1) driveway
shall be permitted for each fifty (50) feet between adjacent driveway flares or
driveways without flares.
(k) Off-street loading and parking space shall be provided in accordance with the
specifications in this section in all districts, whenever any new use is established
or an existing one is enlarged, except where a single family dwelling is enlarged.
Because of its developed nature and the location of service alleys, on-street and
public parking facilities, off-street loading and parking requirements shall not
apply in the CBD Central Business District.
(1) Off-Street Loading: Except in the CBD Central Business District, every
use which requires the receipt or distribution by vehicle, of material or
merchandise, shall provide a minimum of off-street loading spaces in
accordance with its size per the following Table 1306.08(k)(1):

(2) Off-Street Loading Size and Access: Each off-street loading space
shall be not less than ten (10) feet in uniform width and forty (40) feet in
length. It shall be so designed so the vehicles using loading spaces
are not required to back onto a public way. Such spaces shall abut a
public way or have an easement or access thereto. Where an existing
lot does not abut on a public way, or easement of access, there shall
be provided an access driveway, minimum ten (10) feet wide, leading
to the loading spaces.
(3) Off-Street Parking Size and Access: Each off-street parking space
shall have an area not less than one hundred sixty-two (162) feet,
being at least eighteen (18) feet long with a uniform width of nine (9)
feet, exclusive of access driveways or aisles and shall be in usable
shape and condition. Except in the case of single family and two family
dwelling units, no parking lot shall contain less than three (3) spaces.
Where an existing lot does not abut on a public way, or easement of
access, there shall be provided an access driveway, minimum ten (10)
feet wide, leading to the parking areas.
(4) Parking Within Yards: In residential districts, required parking spaces
shall be permitted only in the rear or side yards and in driveways as
provided this Ordinance.
(5) Number of Parking Spaces Required: The number of off-street parking
spaces required is set forth on the following Table 1306.08(k)(5).
Where the use of the premises is not specifically mentioned,
requirements shall be one (1) space for each two hundred (250) feet of
gross floor area. Where more than one (1) use exists at any one time
on a lot, parking regulations for each use must be met. No parking
spaces shall be required of existing or future uses in the CBD Central
Business District, except where the lot is for residential use or the lot is
of sufficient size to accommodate the parking space requirements set
forth in this Ordinance.

be required to follow normal parking standards if they revert to non-elderly use.
** Plus one (1) space per employee and staff on major shift.
Note: GFA means gross floor area.
(6) Location and Parking: Required parking spaces shall be located on the
same lot with the principal use; however, the required parking spaces
may be on an adjacent lot only if the owner combines the lots into one
lot. Additional parking spaces that are not required for the principal use
may be located on an adjacent lot. The Board may permit required
parking spaces to be located not more than four hundred (400) feet
from the lot of the principal use, and the Board finds that it is impractical
to provide required parking on the same lot with the principal use.
(7) Stacking Capacity: On-site stacking capacity for various uses shall be
as follows:
(a) Drive-Through Restaurants: Six (6) vehicle stacking capacity
measured from the pickup window.
(b) Drive-Through Distributors: Four (4) vehicle stacking capacity
measured from the pickup window or area.
(c) Drive-Through Banks: Per drive-through lane, five (5) vehicle
stacking capacity measured from the drive-through window or
bank machine.
(d) Car Washes: Per car wash bay, six (6) vehicle stacking capacity
measured from the car wash bay.
(e) For the other drive-through uses, similar requirements will be
imposed, using the above as a guide or by reference to
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regulations.
For purposes of this section, stacking capacity shall be measured based
on a vehicle length of eighteen (18) feet. Under all circumstances, in no
event shall vehicles be required to back onto the public right-of-way, or
use the public right-of-way for stacking capacity.
(8) Screening and Landscaping: Off-street parking areas for more than five
(5) vehicles, and off-street loading areas, shall be screened by a fence
or screen planting, at least six (6) feet in height, on any side which
adjoins a residential district. Any fence or screen planting must block
the line of sight to prevent or substantially reduce light trespass.
(9) Surfacing: All driveways and parking areas shall be
constructed and maintained with a surface of concrete, brick,
or bituminous material, washed gravel or limestone, or
similar material sufficient to prevent mud or driveway
material from being washed or carried by vehicles from the
driveway or parking area onto the public way. They shall be
graded with positive draining to dispose of surface water.
Parking areas larger than five hundred (500) square feet
shall submit a plan, including draining provisions, to the
Zoning Officer for approval. Lots shall be designed to
provide for orderly and safe loading and parking.
(10) Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking or
loading areas shall be arranged so as to reflect the light
away from the adjoining premises of any residential district
or use and away from the public way. Any lighting shall meet
the requirements of this Ordinance.
1306.09 STEEP SLOPE AREAS
Any development of slopes of more than five (5) percent must be
submitted on a plan prepared by a registered engineer or architect showing how
the development will treat the slope problem. The Zoning Officer shall refer the
plan to the City Engineer or a consulting engineer for review and advice before
issuing any permit. The cost for review and advice shall be paid by the
developer.
1306.10 FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
The City of Franklin has adopted an ordinance regulating development
within a floodplain. All development within designated areas are required to
follow the regulations contained in Article 1314.
1306.11 SATELLITE DISH ANTENNAE
Satellite dish antennae shall meet the following conditions:
(a) In all districts, satellite dish antennae that can transmit and/or
receive shall be allowed in rear yards or attached to the main
building only; provided, however, that:
(1) The satellite dish antenna shall be at least ten (10) feet from
any lot line; and
(2) In industrial and commercial districts, the satellite dish
antenna shall not exceed twelve (12) feet in diameter and
shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet in height from the ground to
the top of the satellite dish antenna in a rear yard, or, if
attached to the main building, from the base structure of the
satellite dish antenna to the top of the satellite dish antenna;
and

purpose of the Certificate of Occupancy is to confirm that the
construction, development or use described in the Building/Zoning

different use and changes to a nonconforming use or structure.
(c) Zoning Certificate: A Zoning Certificate shall be issued upon
request to confirm that the use of land or a building within the City

charged for the issuance of the certificate shall be determined by
the City Council.
(d) Nonconforming Certificate: Upon request, the Zoning Officer will

structure in question is legally nonconforming. Where the Zoning
Officer cannot establish the case clearly, the request shall be
denied. Upon appeal, it shall be referred to the Zoning Hearing
Board for a decision.
1309.04 VIOLATIONS
(a) Enforcement Notice: When it appears to the Zoning Officer that a

enforcement notice. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the
owner of record of the parcel on which the violation has occurred,
to any person who has filed a written request to receive
enforcement notices regarding the parcel, and to any other person
requested in writing by the owner of record. The enforcement
notice shall state the following:
(1) The name of the owner of record and any other person
against whom the City intends to take action;
(2) The location or description of the property in violation;
(3) The specific violation with a description of the requirements
which have not been met, citing in each instance the
applicable provisions of this Ordinance;
(4) The date before which the steps for compliance must
commence, and the date by which the steps for compliance
must be completed.
(5) That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within a prescribed period of time in
accordance with procedures set forth in this Ordinance; and
(6) That failure to comply with the notice within the time
specified, unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing
Board, constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly
described.
(b) Causes of Action: In case any building, structure, sign, landscaping
or land is, or is proposed to be, erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, converted, maintained or used in violation of this
Ordinance, the City Council or, with the approval of the City
Council, the Zoning Officer or any aggrieved owner or tenant of real
property who shows that his property or person will be substantially
affected by the alleged violation, in addition to other remedies, may
institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain,
correct or abate such building, structure, sign, landscaping or land,
or to prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business
or use constituting a violation of this Ordinance. When any such
action is instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice of that action
shall be served upon the City at least thirty (30) days prior to the
time the action commences by serving a copy of the complaint on
the Zoning Officer and the City Manager. No such action may be
maintained until such notice has been given.
(c) Jurisdiction: The Magisterial District Judge with jurisdiction in the
City shall have initial jurisdiction over proceedings brought under
this Ordinance.
(d) Enforcement Remedies: Any person that has violated, or permitted the
violation of, the provisions of this Ordinance shall, upon being found
liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
City, pay a judgment of not more than Five Hundred ($500) Dollars
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
City as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed,
levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation by
the Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the City may enforce the judgment pursuant to
the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the Magisterial
District Judge determining that there has been a violation, further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person violating
this Ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in
which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a
violation by the Magisterial District Judge and thereafter each day that
a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the
violation of this Ordinance shall be paid over to the City. Nothing
contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to grant any
person other than the City and its Zoning Officer the right to commence
any action for enforcement pursuant to this Ordinance.

terms as such and may succeed themselves. For the conduct of any hearing or the taking
of any action, a quorum shall be not less than the majority of all the members of the Board,

persons opposed to the application are granted an equal number of additional
hearings. Persons opposed to the application may, upon the written consent
or consent on the record by the applicant and municipality, be granted
additional hearings to complete their opposition to the application provided the

member or an independent attorney as a hearing officer. The decision, or,
where no decision is called for, the findings shall be made by the Board;

the Board and accept the decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
(e) The parties to the hearing shall be the City, any person affected by the

ordered by the Board or hearing officer, or shall be paid by the person
appealing from the decision of the Board if such appeal is made, and in either
event the cost of additional copies shall be paid by the person requesting
such copy or copies. In other cases, the party requesting the original
transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
(j) The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be;

representatives in connection with any issue involved, except upon
notice and opportunity for all parties to participate, and except that
advice from the Board's solicitor is exempt from this restriction;

or other materials unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to
contest the material so noticed; and
(3) shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after the commencement

decision or, when no decision is called for, make written findings on the
application within forty-five (45) days after the last hearing before the Board or
hearing officer. Where application is contested or denied, each decision shall
be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together
with the reasons therefore. Conclusions based on any provisions of this
Ordinance or the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, or any rule or
regulation, shall contain a reference to the provision relied upon and the
reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the facts
found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, and there has been no
stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Board shall make his
report and recommendations available to the parties within forty-five (45)
days, and the parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon
to the Board prior to final decision or entry of findings, and the Board's
decision shall be entered no later than thirty (30) days after the report of the
hearing officer. Except for challenges filed under Section 1310.13 of this
Ordinance and Section 916.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code, where the
Board fails to render the decision within the period required by this Ordinance
or the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, or fails to commence,
conduct or complete the required hearings as provided in Section 1310.07(c)
of this Ordinance, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in
favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the
record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor
of the applicant because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a
decision as hereinabove provided, the Board shall give public notice of said
decision within ten (10) days from the last day it could have met to render a
decision in the same manner as provided in Section 1310.07(a) of this
Ordinance. If the Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do
so. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party to appeal
the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
(l) A copy of the final decision, or, where no decision is called for, of the findings
shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him not later than
the day following its date. To all other persons who have filed their name and
address with the Board no later than the last day of the hearing, the Board
shall provide by mail or otherwise, a brief notice of the decision or findings
and a statement of the place at which the full decision or findings may be
examined.
1310.08 JURISDICTION
(a) The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and render final
adjudications in the following matters:

except those brought before the governing body pursuant to Sections
609.1 and 916.1(a)(2) of the Municipalities Planning Code
(2) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including, but not
limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act on the

the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure
or lot.
(3) Appeals from a determination by the City Engineer or the Zoning
Officer with reference to the administration of any flood plain or flood
hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance.

hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance,
pursuant to Section 910.2 of the Municipalities Planning Code and
Section 1310.09 of this Ordinance.
(5) Applications for special exceptions under this Ordinance or flood plain
or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use
ordinance, pursuant to Section 912.1 of the Municipalities Planning
Code and Section 1304 of this Ordinance. In granting a special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the Ordinance, as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Ordinance.
(6) Appeals from the determination of any officer or agency charged with
the administration of any transfers of development rights or
performance density provisions of this Ordinance.

Ordinance.
(8) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or City Engineer
in the administration of any land use ordinance or provision thereof with
reference to sedimentation and erosion control and storm water
management insofar as the same relate to development not involving
Articles V or VII applications of the Municipalities Planning Code.
(9) Applications for reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing
Amendments Act or the Americans With Disabilities Act, pursuant to
Section 1310.14 of this Ordinance.
(b) The City Council or, except as to clauses (3), (4) and (5), the Planning
Commission, if designated, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
render final adjudications in the following matters:
(1) All applications for approvals of planned residential developments
under Section 1312 of this Ordinance and Article VII of the
Municipalities Planning Code pursuant to the provisions of Section 702.
(2) All applications pursuant to the Franklin Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance and Section 508 of the Municipalities Planning
Code for approval of subdivisions or land developments under Article
V. Any provision in a subdivision and land development ordinance
requiring that final action concerning subdivision and land development
applications be taken by a planning agency rather than the governing
body shall vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Planning Commission in lieu
of the City Council for purposes of the provisions of this paragraph.
(3) Applications for conditional use under the express provisions of Section
1306 of this Ordinance pursuant to Section 603(c)(2) of the

thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and storm
water management insofar as the same relate to application for land
development under the Franklin Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance and Section 1312 of this Ordinance (relative to planned
residential development), and Articles V and VII of the Municipalities
Planning Code. Where such determination relates only to development
not involving an Article V or VII application, the appeal from such
determination of the Zoning Officer or the City Engineer shall be to the
Board pursuant to Section 1310.08(a)(9). Where this Codified
Ordinances of the City of Franklin vest jurisdiction for final
administration of subdivision and land development applications in the
Planning Commission, all appeals from determinations under this
paragraph shall be to the Planning Commission and all appeals from
the decision of the Planning Commission shall be to court.
1310.09 VARIANCES
The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of
this Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may by rule
prescribe the form of application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Board may grant a variance provided that all of the following findings are made
where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property,
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this
Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant;
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property,
nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will
afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation
in issue.
In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Ordinance.
Use variances are not allowed within the City of Franklin. Any change in the use of a
property must be made in the form of a conditional use permit when the proposed use
varies from those uses allowed otherwise in this Ordinance.
1310.10 PARTIES APPELLANT BEFORE BOARD
Appeals under Sections 1310.08(a)(1), (2), (3), (6), (7), and (8) of this Ordinance
may be filed with the Board in writing by the landowner affected, the Zoning Officer, or any
person aggrieved. Requests for a variance or special exception under Sections
1306.08(a)(5) and (6) may be filed with the Board or Zoning Officer by any landowner or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner.
1310.11 TIME LIMITATIONS; PERSONS AGGRIEVED
In accordance with Section 914.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code:
(a) No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later than
thirty (30) days after an application for development, preliminary or final, has
been approved by an appropriate officer, agency or body if such proceeding is
designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner, unless
such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge, or reason
to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded
to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his
predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to
appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative ordinance or map pursuant to
Section 1310.13(i) of this Ordinance and Section 916.2 of the Municipalities
Planning Code shall preclude an appeal from a final approval, except in the
case where the final submission substantially deviates from the approved
tentative approval.
(b) All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed by the
landowner within thirty (30) days after notice of determination is issued.
1310.12 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS
In accordance with Section 915.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code:
(a) Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Sections 1310.08 and 1310.10,
and during its pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to
any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any
agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the
Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board
facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the
court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the
Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
(b) After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if
the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be
presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of the applicant for
a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all evidence
presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the
petition for a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellant’s to
post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked
by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the court.
(c) The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount
of the bond shall be in the sound discretion of the court. An order denying a
petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing the responding
party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
(d) If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an order
of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post bond and the
appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a bond, the
respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and after
hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for
reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.
1310.13 VALIDITY OF ORDINANCE; SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS; PRELIMINARY
OPINIONS
In accordance with Sections 916.1 and 916.2 of the Municipalities Planning Code:
(a) A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the validity of
an ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits or restricts the
use or development of land in which he has an interest shall submit the
challenge either:
(1) to the Board under Section 1310.08(a)(1) of this Ordinance and
Section 909.1(a) of the Municipalities Planning Code; or
(2) to City Council under Section 1310.08(b)(4) of this Ordinance and
Section 909.1(b)(4) of the Municipalities Planning Code, together with a
request for a curative amendment under Section 1311.04 of this
Ordinance and Section 609.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code.
(b) Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of another
by an ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desires to challenge its
validity on substantive grounds shall first submit their challenge to the Board
for a decision thereon under Section 1310.08(a)(1) of this Ordinance and
Section 909.1(a)(1) of the Municipalities Planning Code.
(c) The submissions referred to in subsections (a) and (b) shall be governed by
the following:
(1) In challenges before the Board, the challenging party shall make a
written request to the Board that it hold a hearing on its challenge. The
request shall contain the reasons for the challenge. Where the
landowner desires to challenge the validity of such ordinance and
elects to proceed by curative amendment under Section 1311.04 of this
Ordinance and Section 609.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code, his
application to the City Council shall contain, in addition to the
requirements of the written request hereof, the plans and explanatory
materials describing the use or development proposed by the
landowner in lieu of the use or development permitted by the
challenged ordinance or map. Such plans or other materials shall not
be required to meet the standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative
or final approval or for the issuance of a permit, so long as they provide
reasonable notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient
basis for evaluating the challenged ordinance or map in light thereof.
Nothing herein contained shall preclude the landowner from first
seeking a final approval before submitting his challenge.
(2) If the submission is made by the landowner to the City Council under
Section 1310.13(a)(2), the request also shall be accompanied by an
amendment or amendments to the ordinance proposed by the
landowner to cure the alleged defects therein.
(3) If the submission is made to the City Council, the municipal solicitor
shall represent and advise it at the hearing or hearings referred to in
Section 1310.08(b)(4) of this Ordinance and Section 909.1(b)(4) of the
Municipalities Planning Code.
(4) The City Council may retain an independent attorney to present the
defense of the challenged ordinance or map on its behalf and to
present their witnesses on its behalf.
(5) Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the
City Council or the Board, as the case may be, shall determine whether
the challenged ordinance or map is defective, as alleged by the
landowner. If a challenge heard by City Council is found to have merit,
City Council shall proceed as provided in Section 1311.04 of this
Ordinance and Section 609.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code. If a
challenge heard by the Board is found to have merit, the decision of the
Board shall include recommended amendments to the challenged
ordinance which will cure the defects found. In reaching its decision,
the Board shall consider the amendments, plans and explanatory
material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
(i) the impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(ii) if the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the
proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available to
and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully
excluded by the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map;
(iii) the suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site’s soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, flood plains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;
(iv) the impact of the proposed use on the site’s soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, flood plains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed,
the tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts; and
(v) the impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
(6) The City Council or the Board, as the case may be, shall render its
decision within forty-five (45) days after the conclusion of the last
hearing.
(7) If the City Council or the Board, as the case may be, fails to act on the
landowner’s request within the time limits referred to in Section
1310.13(c)(6), a denial of the request is deemed to have occurred on
the 46th day after the close of the last hearing.
(d) The Board or City Council, as the case may be, shall commence its hearings
within sixty (60) days after the request is filed unless the landowner requests
or consents to an extension of time.
(e) Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of the
ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where and the times
when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory material or
proposed amendments may be examined by the public.
(f) The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
(1) the Board or City Council, as the case may be, fails to commence the
hearing within the time limits set forth in Section 1310.13(d);
(2) the City Council notifies the landowner that it will not adopt the curative
amendment;
(3) the City Council adopts another curative amendment which is
unacceptable to the landowner; or
(4) the Board or City Council, as the case may be, fails to act on the
request forty-five (45) days after the close of the last hearing on the
request, unless the time is extended by mutual consent by the
landowner and the City.
(g) Where, after the effective date of this Ordinance, a curative amendment proposal
is approved by the grant of a curative amendment application by the City Council
pursuant to Section 1310.08(b)(4) of this Ordinance, and Section 909.1(b)(4) of
the Municipalities Planning Code, or a validity challenge is sustained by the
Board pursuant to Section 1310.08(a)(1) of this Ordinance, and Section
909.1(a)(1) of the Municipalities Planning Code, or the court acts finally on
appeal from denial of a curative amendment proposal or a validity challenge, and
the proposal or challenge so approved requires a further application for
subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two (2) years from the
date of such approval to file an application for preliminary or tentative approval
pursuant to Franklin Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance or Section
1312 of this Ordinance (relative to planned unit development), and Article V or
VII of the Municipalities Planning Code. Within the two-year period, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the
rights of the applicant as granted in the curative amendment or the sustained
validity challenge. Upon the filing of the preliminary or tentative plan, the
provisions of Section 508(4) of the Municipalities Planning Code shall apply.
Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment application or the
validity challenge is approved but does not require further application under any
subdivision or land development ordinance, the developer shall have one (1)
year within which to file for a building permit. Within the one-year period, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the
rights of the applicant as granted in the curative amendment or the sustained
validity challenge. During these protected periods, the court shall retain or
assume jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding such supplemental relief as may
be necessary.
(h) A landowner who has challenged on substantive grounds the validity of a
zoning ordinance or map either by submission of a curative amendment to the
City Council under Section 1310.13 (a)(2) or to the Board under Section
1310.08(a)(1) shall not submit any additional substantive challenges involving
the same parcel, group of parcels or part thereof until such time as the status
of the landowner’s original challenge has been finally determined or
withdrawn; provided, however, that if after the date of the landowner’s original
challenge the City Council adopts a substantially new or different zoning
ordinance or zoning map, the landowner may file a second substantive
challenge to the new or different zoning ordinance or zoning map under
Section 1310.13(a).
(i) Preliminary Opinions: In order not to unreasonably delay the time when a
landowner may secure assurance that the ordinance or map under which he
proposed to build is free from challenge, and recognizing that the procedure
for preliminary approval of his development may be too cumbersome or may
be unavailable, the landowner may advance the date from which time for any
challenge to the ordinance or map will run under Section 1310.11 of this
Ordinance by the following procedure:
(1) The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing his
proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a preliminary
opinion as to their compliance with the applicable ordinances and
maps. Such plans and other materials shall not be required to meet
the standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or
for the issuance of a building permit so long as they provide reasonable
notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for a
preliminary opinion as to its compliance.
(2) If the Zoning Officer’s preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof shall
be published once each week for two (2) successive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City. Such notice shall include a
general description of the proposed use or development and its
location, by some readily identifiable directive, and the place and times
where the plans and other materials may be examined by the public.
The favorable preliminary approval under Section 1310.11 and the time
therein specified for commencing a proceeding with the Board shall run
from the time when the second notice thereof has been published.
(3) The landowner shall pay all advertising costs for a preliminary opinion.
1310.14 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
UNDER THE FHA OR ADA
(a) Persons with a claim for a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing
Amendments Act (FHA) or the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) shall
submit their request in writing to the Zoning Officer on an application form
which shall require the following information, and such other information as
may be reasonably needed to process the request:
(1) Specific citation of the Zoning Ordinance provision from which
reasonable accommodation is requested;
(2) The name and address of the applicant(s);
(3) A specific description of the reasonable accommodation sought and
the particulars, including exact dimensions of any proposed structural

(6) A description of any alternative methods of relieving the claimed
hardship that have been considered and the reason, if any, why
applicant(s) have rejected such alternatives;
(7) A statement describing why the requested accommodation is
necessary to afford the applicant(s) an opportunity equal to a nonhandicapped
or non-disabled person to use and enjoy the dwelling in
question;
(8) A description of the manner in which the accommodation, if granted,
will be terminated or recovered if no longer required to afford equal
housing opportunity to handicapped or disabled persons; and
(9) A statement of any facts indicating whether non-handicapped or nondisabled
persons would be permitted to utilize the property in question
in a manner similar to that sought by applicant(s).
(b) In determining whether to grant reasonable accommodation, the Zoning
Officer shall consider, inter alia, the following factors:
(1) Whether the applicant(s) is/are handicapped or disabled within the
meaning of the FHA or ADA;
(2) The degree to which the accommodation sought is related to the
handicap or disability of the applicant(s);
(3) The extent to which the proposed accommodation may impact other
property owners in the immediate vicinity;
(4) The extent to which the requested accommodation may be consistent
with or contrary to the zoning purposes promoted by the Zoning
Ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan, and the community development
objectives set forth in the Zoning Ordinance;
(5) The extent to which the requested accommodation would impose
financial and administrative burdens upon the City;
(6) The extent to which the requested accommodation would impose an
undue hardship upon the City;
(7) The extent to which the requested accommodation would require a
fundamental alteration in the nature of the City’s regulatory policies,
objectives and regulations;
(8) The extent to which the requested accommodation would result in
subsidy, privilege or benefit not available to non-handicapped or nondisabled
persons;
(9) The permanency of the requested accommodation and the conditions
under which such accommodation would be removed, terminated or
discontinued when no longer needed to provide handicapped or
disabled persons with equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling
in question; and
(10) The extent to which the requested accommodation will increase the
value of the property during and after its occupancy by the applicant(s).

1311.04 CURATIVE AMENDMENTS
In accordance with Sections 609.1 and 609.2 of the Municipalities
Planning Code:
(a) A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the
validity of a zoning ordinance or map or any provision thereof,
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which
he has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the City
Council with a written request that his challenge and proposed
amendment be heard and decided as provided in Section 1310.13
of this Ordinance and Section 916.1 of the Municipalities Planning
Code. The City Council shall commence a hearing thereon within
sixty (60) days of the request as provided in Section 1310.13 of this
Ordinance and Section 916.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code.
The curative amendment and challenge shall be referred to the
Planning Commission and the Venango County Planning
Commission as provided in Section 1311.03 of this Ordinance and
Section 609 of the Municipalities Planning Code, and notice of the
hearing thereon shall be given as provided in Sections 1311.05 and
1310.13, and Sections 610 and 916.1 of the Municipalities Planning
Code.
(b) The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Section
1310.07 of this Ordinance and Section 908 of the Municipalities
Planning Code, and all references therein to the Board shall, for
purposes of this section be references to the City Council; provided,
however, that the provisions of Sections 1310.07(c) and (k) of this
Ordinance, and Section 908 (1.2) and (9) of the Municipalities
Planning Code, shall not apply and the provisions of Section
1310.13 of this Ordinance, and Section 916.1 of the Municipalities
Planning Code, shall control. If the City Council does not accept a
landowner’s curative amendment brought in accordance with this
Section and a court subsequently rules that the challenge has
merit, the court’s decision shall not result in a declaration of
invalidity for the entire zoning ordinance and map, but only for
those provisions which specifically relate to the landowner’s
curative amendment and challenge.
(c) If the City Council determines that a validity challenge has merit, it
may accept a landowner’s curative amendment, with or without
revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure
the challenged defects. The City Council shall consider the
curative amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by
the landowner and shall also consider:
(1) the impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(2) if the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness
of the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the
ordinance or map;
(3) the suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site’s soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, flood plains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features;
(4) the impact of the proposed use on the site’s soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, flood plains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development
and any adverse environmental impacts; and
(5) the impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(d) If the City Council determines that this Ordinance or any portion
thereof is substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
(1) The City Council shall declare by formal action, its zoning
ordinance or portions thereof substantively invalid and
propose to prepare a curative amendment to overcome such
invalidity. Within thirty (30) days following such declaration
and proposal, the City Council shall:
(i) By resolution make specific findings setting forth the
declared invalidity of the zoning ordinance which may
include:
(a) references to specific uses which are either not
permitted or not permitted in sufficient quantity;
(b) reference to a class of use or uses which
require revision; or
(c) reference to the entire ordinance which
requires revisions.
(ii) Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment
to the zoning ordinance to correct the declared
invalidity.
(2) Within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the
declaration and proposal, the City Council shall enact a
curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm the validity of, its
zoning ordinance pursuant to the provisions required by
Section 1311.03 of this Ordinance and Section 609 of the
Municipalities Planning Code in order to cure the declared
invalidity of the zoning ordinance.
(3) Upon the initiation of the procedures, as set forth in Section
1311.04(d)(1), the City Council shall not be required to
entertain or consider any landowner’s curative amendment
filed under Section 1311.04(a) of this Ordinance and Section
609.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code, nor shall the
Board be required to give a report requested under Sections
1310.08 and 1310.13 of this Ordinance and Section 909.1 or
916.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code, subsequent to the
declaration and proposal based upon the grounds identical
to or substantially similar to those specified in the resolution
required by Section 1311.04(d)(1)(i). Upon completion of the
procedures as set forth in Sections 1311.04(d)(1) and (2), no
rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of Sections
1310.08 and 1310.13 of this Ordinance and Section 909.1 or
916.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code shall, from the
date of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any
landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of the
unamended zoning ordinance for which there has been a
curative amendment pursuant to this section.
(4) The City Council having utilized the procedures as set forth
in Section 1311.04(d)(1) and (2) may not again utilize said
procedure for a 36-month period following the date of the
enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the
validity of its zoning ordinance, pursuant to Section
1311.04(d)(2); provided, however, if after the date of
declaration and proposal there is a substantially new duty or
obligation imposed upon the City by virtue of a change in
statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania appellate court
decision, the City Council may utilize the provisions of this
Section to prepare a curative amendment to its ordinance to
fulfill said duty or obligation
1311.05 PUBLICATION, ADVERTISEMENT AND AVAILABILITY OF
ORDINANCES
In accordance with Section 610 of the Municipalities Planning Code:
(a) Proposed zoning ordinances and amendments shall not be enacted
unless notice of proposed enactment is given in the manner set
forth in this Section, and shall include the time and place of the
meeting at which passage will be considered, a reference to a
place within the City where copies of the proposed ordinance or
amendment may be examined without charge or obtained for a
charge not greater than the cost thereof. The governing body shall
publish the proposed ordinance or amendment once in one (1)
newspaper of general circulation in the City not more than sixty (60)
days nor less than seven (7) days prior to passage. Publication of
the proposed ordinance or amendment shall include either the full
text thereof or the title and a brief summary, prepared by the City
Solicitor and setting forth all the provisions in reasonable detail. If
the full text is not included:
(1) A copy thereof shall be supplied to a newspaper of general
circulation in the City at the time the public notice is

than that necessary to cover the actual costs of storing said
ordinances.
(b) In the event substantial amendments are made in the proposed
ordinance or amendment, before voting upon enactment, the City
Council shall, at least ten (10) days prior to enactment, readvertise,
in one (1) newspaper of general circulation in the City, a brief
summary setting forth all the provisions in reasonable detail
together with a summary of the amendments.
(c) Zoning ordinances and amendments may be incorporated into
official ordinance books by reference with the same force and effect
as if duly recorded therein.
1311.06 APPLICABILITY OF ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS
When an application for either a special exception or a conditional use has
been filed with either the Board or City Council, as relevant, and the subject
matter of such application would ultimately constitute either a subdivision or land
development, no change or amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other
governing ordinance or plans shall affect the decision on such application
adversely to the applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in
accordance with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they
stood at the time the application was duly filed. Provided, further, should such an
application be approved by either the Board or City Council, as relevant, the
applicant shall be entitled to proceed with the submission of either land
development or subdivision plans within a period of six (6) months or longer as
may be approved by either the Board or City Council following the date of such
approval in accordance with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans
as they stood at the time the application was duly filed before either the Board or
City Council, as relevant. If either a land development or subdivision plan is so
filed within said period, such plan shall be subject to the provisions of the
Franklin Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, and specifically to the
time limitations set forth therein, which shall commence as of the date of filing
such land development or subdivision plan.”
Article 1312
Planned Residential Development
1312.01 Planned Residential
Development
1312.01 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
Purpose: The purpose of the planned residential development regulations is to
encourage the flexibility in the design and development of land in order to promote its most
appropriate use; to encourage grouping of housing and a mixture of housing types in
alternative patterns and in a variety of ways; to facilitate the adequate and economical
provision of streets and utilities; and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open
areas. Planned residential developments are permitted in the R-1 and R-2 Districts.
a.) Minimum Development Size: No planned residential development may
include less than ten (10) acres of contiguous land.
b.) General Standards: The planned residential development must meet all of
the following general standards:
b.1) The planned residential development is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance's Statement of Community
Development Objectives.
b.2) The planned residential development is an effective and unified
treatment of the development possibilities on the project site, and the
development plan makes appropriate provision for the preservation of
streams and stream banks, wetlands, wooded cover, rough terrain,
and similar areas.
b.3) The planned residential development shall be planned and developed
to harmonize with any existing or proposed development in the area
surrounding the project site.
b.4) Performance bond for all improvements in the development must be
posted as required in the Franklin City Subdivision Ordinance.
b.5) Connection to Franklin sanitary sewer system shall be required.
b.6) Connection to the Franklin public water system shall be required.
c.) Applicable Districts and Uses Permitted: Planned residential developments
may be approved in the R-1 and R-2 Residential Districts and may include
the following additional uses: multiple-family dwellings and related uses.
Such additional uses shall be allowed only to the extent that the City finds
them to be compatibly and harmoniously incorporated into the design of the
planned development. (Mobile homes and mobile home parks are excluded
from the planned residential development district.)
d.) Calculations of Project Densities: The number of dwelling units which may
be constructed within the planned residential development shall be
determined by dividing the gross project area by the required lot area per
dwelling unit which is required in the R-1 and R-2 Districts.
e.) Increase in Density: It is recognized that the expense of complying with the
approval process contained in the planned residential development
regulations may discourage developers from seeking approval of a planned
residential development project. At the time the outline or preliminary
development plan is filed, the applicant may apply for an increase in the
densities permitted by the zone in which the planned residential development
is to be constructed. If it gives its approval to the planned residential
development, the City Council may authorize the developer to increase
permitted densities by an amount up to ten (10) percent.
Additional increase in density may be granted up to twenty (20) percent
providing:
e.1) If common open space is developed to more intense usable open
space providing facilities for active outdoor recreation, such as
playgrounds, playground equipment, picnic facilities, ball fields and
equipment, or other similar improvements to the open space, an
additional ten (10) percent increase in density may be permitted.
e.2) If item b.1) above is developed and unique indoor-outdoor buildings,
to be used for recreation or other similar activities of the residents of
the development, such as swimming pools, club houses, or other
similar buildings, are provided, then an additional ten (10) percent
increase in density may be permitted.
f.) Lot Size and Spacing of Buildings: The location of all structures shall be as
shown on final plans. The proposed location and arrangement shall not be
detrimental to existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the existing or
prospective development of the neighborhood. There shall be no minimum
lot size, no minimum or maximum percentage of lot coverage and no
minimum lot width in the planned residential development. However, every
single-family dwelling shall have access to a public street, court, walkway, or
other area dedicated to public use. No dwelling and no addition to any
dwellings shall be erected within a distance of less than the height of the
highest adjacent building.
Vehicular access to dwellings by means of adequate service drives and/or
emergency entrances shall be provided in all cases where dwellings do not
front on a public street, or where the City deems necessary for public safety.
g.) Perimeter Requirements: The requirements of this section apply only to
structures located within two hundred (200) feet of the perimeter of a planned
residential development. If topographical or other barriers do not provide
adequate privacy for existing uses adjacent to the planned residential
development, the Planning Commission may require either or both of the
following:
g.1) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential
development must be set back by a distance sufficient to protect the
privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses, in no case less than
the height of the buildings.
g.2) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential
development must be permanently screened in a manner which is
sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses.
h.) Common Open Space Required: The development plan will contain areas to
be allocated for common open space which satisfy the standards governing
the usability and quality of common open space that is contained in this
Ordinance.
No open area may be accepted as common open space under the provisions
of this Ordinance unless it meets the following standards:
h.1) A minimum of two (2) acres of common open space shall be provided
including usable and scenic green space for the first ten (10) acres
plus one (1) acre for each additional five (5) acres or fraction thereof
of gross project area.
h.2) The location, shape, size, and character of the common open space
must be suitable for the planned residential development.
h.3) Common open space must be suitably improved for its intended use,
but common open space containing natural features worthy of
preservation may be left unimproved. The building, structures, and
improvements which are permitted in the common open space must
be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the common open
space and must conserve and enhance the amenities of the common
open space having regard to its topography and unimproved
condition.
h.4) The development schedule which is part of the development plan
must coordinate the improvement of the common open space, the
construction of buildings, structures, and improvements in the
common open space, and the construction of residential dwellings in
the planned residential development.
h.5) If the final development plan provides for buildings, structures, and
improvements in the common open space of a value in excess of ten
thousand ($10,000) dollars, the developer must provide a bond in the
estimated amount of the improvements assuring that the buildings,
structures, and improvements will be completed. The City Council
shall release the bond or other assurance when the buildings,
structures, or improvements have been completed according to the
development plan.
j.) Conveyance and Maintenance of Common Space: All land shown on the
final development plan as common open space must be conveyed under one
of the following options:
j.1) It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to maintain
the common open space and any buildings, structures, or
improvements which have been placed on it, in which case the
general public must have use of the open space.
j.2) It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture establishing
an association or similar organization for the maintenance of the
planned residential development. The common open space must be
conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants to be approved by the
City which restrict the common open space to the uses specified on
the final development plan, and which provide for the maintenance of
the common open space in a manner which assures its containing use
for its intended purpose.
i) No common open space may be put to any use not specified in
the final development plan unless the final development plan
has been amended to permit that use. However, no change of
use authorized under Section 1308.01 c.) may be considered
as a waiver of any of the covenants limiting the use of common
open space areas, and all rights to enforce these covenants
against any use permitted are expressly reserved.
ii) If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency,
either one of the following methods of enforcement must be
provided:
(a) The legal right to develop the common open space for
the uses not specified in the final development plan
must be approved by the City.
(b) The restrictions governing the use, improvement, and
maintenance of the common open space must be stated
as conditions to the conveyance of the common open
space, the fee title to the common open space to vest in
a public agency in the event of a substantial default in
the stated conditions.
iii) If the common open space is not conveyed to the City, or a
public agency approved by the City, the covenants governing
the use, improvement, and maintenance of the common open
space shall then be enforceable by the City, and the instrument
of conveyance shall so provide.
iv) It is the purpose and intent of these regulations that the City
shall have the authority and powers to require the adequate
maintenance of common open space as set forth by Article VII
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
k.) Application for Tentative Approval of Planned Residential Development:
In order to provide an expeditious method for processing a development
plan for a planned residential development under the provisions of this
Ordinance, and to avoid the delay and uncertainty which would arise if it
were necessary to secure approval, by a multiplicity of procedures, of a
plat of subdivision as well as approval of a change in the zoning
regulations otherwise applicable to the property, it is hereby declared to be
in the public interest that all procedures with a planned residential
development and the continuing administration thereof shall utilize the
following provisions:
k.1) An application for tentative approval of the development plan for a
planned residential development shall be filed by or on behalf of the
landowner.
k.2) The application for tentative approval shall be filed by the landowner in
such form, upon the payment of such a reasonable fee as is specified
by the City. The application shall be filed with the Zoning Officer.
k.3) All planning, zoning, and subdivision matters relating to the platting,
use, and development of the planned residential development and
subsequent modifications of the regulations relating thereto, to the
extent such modification is vested in the City, shall be determined and
established by the City Council with the advice of the Planning
Commission.
k.4) The provisions shall require only such information in the application as
is reasonably necessary to disclose to the City of Franklin:
i) The location, size, and topography of the site and the nature of
the landowner's interest in the land proposed to be developed;
ii) The density of land use to be allocated to parts of the site to be
developed;
iii) The location and size of the common open space and the form
of organization proposed to own and maintain the common
open space;
iv) The use and the approximate height, bulk, and location of
buildings and other structures;
v) The feasibility of proposals for water supply and the disposition
of sanitary waste and storm water;
vi) The substance of covenants, grants of easements, or other
restrictions proposed to be imposed upon the use of the land,
buildings, and structures including proposed easements or
grants for public utilities;
vii) The provisions for parking of vehicles and the location and
width of proposed streets and public ways;
viii) The required modifications in the municipal land use
regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property;
ix) The feasibility of proposals for energy conservation and the
effective utilization of renewable energy sources; and
x) In the case of development plans which call for development
over a period of years, a schedule showing the proposed times
within which applications for final approval of all sections of the
planned residential development are intended to be filed and
this schedule must be updated annually, on the anniversary of
its approval, until the development is completed and accepted.
k.5) The application for tentative approval of a planned residential
development shall include a written statement by the landowner
setting forth the reasons why, in his opinion, a planned residential
development would be in the public interest and would be consistent
with the comprehensive plan for the development of the municipality.
k.6) The application for tentative approval shall be forwarded to the City of
Franklin Planning Commission for their review and comments. The
Planning Commission shall have thirty-five (35) days, from the date of
filing, to complete their review and make their recommendations to the
City Council.
k.7) All applications for tentative approval shall be forwarded to the
Venango County Planning Commission for their study and
recommendations in accordance with Section 704 of the Planning
Code.
l.) Public Hearings:
l.1) Within sixty (60) days after the filing of an application for tentative
approval of a planned residential development pursuant to this
Ordinance, a public hearing pursuant to public notice of said
application shall be held by the City of Franklin in the manner
prescribed in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
l.2) The City Council may continue the hearing from time to time, and
where applicable, may refer the matter back to the Planning
Commission for additional review, provided, however, that in any
event, the public hearing or hearings shall be concluded within sixty
(60) days after the date of the first public hearing.
m.) The Findings:
m.1) The City Council, within sixty (60) days following the conclusion of the
public hearing provided for in this part, shall, by official written
communication, to the landowner, either:
i) Grant tentative approval of the development plan as submitted;
ii) Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not
included in the development plan as submitted; or
iii) Deny tentative approval to the development plan.
Failure to so act within said period shall be deemed to be a grant of
tentative approval of the development plan as submitted. In the event,
however, the tentative approval is granted subject to conditions, the
landowner may, within thirty (30) days after receiving a copy of the
official written communication of the City notify such City Council of
his refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case, the City shall
be deemed to have denied tentative approval of the development
plan. In the event the landowner does not, within said period, notify
the governing body of his refusal to accept all said conditions,
tentative approval of the development plan, with all said conditions,
shall stand as granted.
m.2) The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of
fact related to the specific proposal and set forth the reasons for the
grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said
communication shall set forth with particularity in what respects the
development plan would or would not be in the public interest,
including, but not limited to, findings of fact and conclusions on the
following:
i) In those respects in which the development plan is or is not
consistent with the comprehensive plan for the development of
the City of Franklin;
ii) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject
property, including, but not limited to, density, bulk, and use,
and the reason why such departures are or are not deemed to
be in the public interest;
iii) The purpose, location, and amount of the common open space
in the planned residential development, the reliability of the
proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common
open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount
and purpose of the common open space as related to the
proposed density and type of residential development;
iv) The physical design of the development plan and the manner
in which said design does or does not make adequate
provision for public services, provide adequate control over
vehicular traffic, and further the amenities of light and air,
recreation, and visual enjoyment.
v) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed
planned residential development to the neighborhood in which
it is proposed to be established; and
vi) In the case of a development plan which proposes
development over a period of years, the sufficiency of the
terms and conditions intended to protect the interests of the
public and of the residents of the planned residential
development in the integrity of the development plan.
m.3) In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or
without conditions, the City may set forth in the official written
communication the time within which an application for final approval
of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a development
plan which provides for development over a period of years, the
periods of time within which applications for final approval of each part
thereof shall be filed. Except upon the consent of the landowner, the
time so established between grant of tentative approval and an
application for final approval shall not be less than twelve (12) months
and, in the case of developments over a period of years, the time
between applications for final approval of each part of a plan shall be
not less than twelve (12) months.
n.) Status of Plan After Tentative Approval:
n.1) The official written communication provided for in this part shall be
certified by the City Clerk of the City Council and shall be filed in his
office, and a certified copy shall be mailed to the landowner. Where
tentative approval has been granted, it shall be deemed an
amendment to the zoning map, effective upon final approval, and shall
be note on the zoning map.
n.2) Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of the
planned residential development for recording nor authorize
development or the issuance of any building permits. A development
plan which has been given tentative approval as submitted, or which
has been given tentative approval with conditions which have been
accepted by the landowner (and provided that the landowner has not
defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the tentative approval),
shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of
the City pending an application or applications for final approval,
without the consent of the landowner, provided an application or
applications for final approval is filed or, in the case of development
over a period of years, provided applications are filed, within the
period of time specified in the official written communication granting
tentative approval.
n.3) In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval and
thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect to
abandon said development plan and shall so notify the governing
body in writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to file
application or applications for final approval within the required period
of time or times, as the case may be, the tentative approval shall be
deemed to be revoked and all that portion of the area included in the
development plan for which final approval has not been given shall be
subject to those local ordinances otherwise applicable thereto as they
may be amended from time to time, and the same shall be noted on
the zoning map and in the records of the City Clerk of the City
Council.
o.) Application for Final Approval:
o.1) An application for final approval may be for all the land included in a
development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative approval,
for a section thereof. Said application shall be made to the Zoning
Officer of the municipality designated by the Ordinance within one (1)
year of the official written communication granting tentative approval.
The application shall include any drawings, specifications, covenants,
easements, performance bond, and such other requirements as may
be specified by this Ordinance, as well as any conditions set forth in
the official written communication at the time of tentative approval. A
public hearing on an application for final approval of the development
plan, or the part thereof, submitted for final approval, shall not be
required provided the development plan, or the part thereof submitted
for final approval is in compliance with the development plan
theretofore given tentative approval and with any specified conditions
attached thereto. The submission shall be reviewed by the Zoning
Officer and the Planning Commission for compliance prior to being
forwarded to the City Council. This review is to take place in thirty-five
(35) days.
o.2) In the event the application for final approval has been filed, together
with all drawings, specifications, and other documents in support
thereof, and as required by the Ordinance and the official written
communication of tentative approval, by the City shall, within forty-five
(45) days of such filing, grant such development plan final approval.
o.3) In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations
from the development plan given tentative approval, the City may
refuse to grant final approval and shall, within forty-five (45) days from
the filing of the application for final approval, so advise the landowner
in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons why
one or more of said variations are not in the public interest. In the
event of such refusal, the landowner may either:
i) Refiled his application for final approval without the variations
objected, or
ii) File a written request with the approving body that it hold a
public hearing on his application for final approval.
If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action, he
may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply
for final approval, or within thirty (30) additional days if the time
for applying for final approval shall have already passed at the
time when the landowner was advised that the development
plan was not in substantial compliance. In the event the
landowner shall fail to take either of these alternative actions
within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan. Any such public hearing shall be held
pursuant to public notice within thirty (30) days after request for
the hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing shall be
conducted in the manner prescribed in this part for public
hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within thirty
(30) days after the conclusion of the hearing, the City shall by
official written communication either grant final approval to the
development plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial
of final approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising
under this section, be in the form and contain the findings
required for an application for tentative approval set forth in this
Ordinance.
o.4) A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval, shall be so certified without delay by the City and shall be
filed of record forthwith in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds before
any development shall take place in accordance therewith. Upon the
filing of record of the development plan, the zoning and subdivision
regulations otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall
cease to apply thereto. Pending completion, in accordance with the
time provisions stated in Section 508 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, of said planned residential development
or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that has been finally
approved, no modification of the provisions of said development plan,
or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made except with the
consent of the landowner. Upon approval of a final plat, the developer
shall record the plat in accordance with the provisions of Section
513(a) and post financial security in accordance with Section 509 of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
o.5) In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given
final approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such plan
or the section thereof that has been finally approved, and shall so
notify the City in writing; or, in the event the landowner shall fail to
commence and carry out the planned residential development in
accordance with the time provisions stated in Section 508 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code after final approval has
been granted, no development or further development shall take place
on the property included in the development plan until after the said
property is reclassified by enactment of any amendment to the City of
Franklin Zoning Ordinance in the manner prescribed for such
amendments in Article 1307.
p.) Enforcement: All enforcement procedures under this section shall be
consistent with Section 712.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code.

PLAIN DISTRICTS
Provisions relating to designated Flood Plain District shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the City of Franklin and shown on the Official Zoning Map as being located
within the boundaries of any flood plain district. (Ord. 11 of 1978, Sect. 3, Passed 9-25-78;
Ord. 4 of 2009, Sect. 2, Passed 4-6-2009)
1314.02 COMPLIANCE WITH FLOOD PROTECTION REGULATIONS
No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure shall be located,
relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except in full
compliance with the terms and provisions of this Ordinance and any other applicable
ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance.
The definitions of the terms and provisions of this Ordinance shall include those set forth in
Sections 1302.02 and 1705.01 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Franklin, and, in the
event of a conflict in definition, the definition set forth in Section 1705.01 shall control. (Ord.
11 of 1978, Sect. 2, Passed 9-25-78; Ord. 4 of 2009, Sect. 2, Passed 4-6-2009; Ord. 9 of
2013, Sect. 1, Passed 12-9-2013)
1314.03 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Ordinance is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted
by debris. This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts, or that
land uses permitted within such districts, will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Franklin or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 11 of 1978, Sect.
3, Passed 9-25-78; Ord. 4 of 2009, Sect. 2, Passed 4-6-2009)
1314.04 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the Flood Plain Districts shall be made by
the Zoning Officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts,
the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the necessary determination. The person questioning
or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
present his case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires.
(Ord. 2 of 2009, Sect. 2, Passed 4-6-2009)
1314.05 DESCRIPTION OF BOUNDARIES
a.) Basis of Districts:
The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the City of Franklin,
classified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
effective January 16, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study. (Ord. 9 of 2013,
Sect. 2, Passed 12-9-2013)
The above references FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by the City of Franklin and declared to be a
part of this Ordinance. (Ord. 9 of 2013, Sect. 2, Passed 12-9-2013)
1.) The Floodway District (FW) is delineated for purposes of this Ordinance
using the criteria that a certain area within the flood plain must be
capable of carrying waters of the one hundred (100) year flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1)
foot at any point. The Floodway District is shown on the City of Franklin
Official Zoning Map. The areas included in this District are specifically
defined in Table II of the above referenced Flood Insurance Study and
shown on the accompanying Flood Boundary Floodway Map.
2.) The Flood-Fringe District (FF) shall be that area of the 100 year flood
plain not included in the Floodway District. The basis for the outermost
boundary of this District shall be the one hundred (100) year flood
elevations contained in the flood profiles of the FIS and as shown on
the accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway Map. In any FF
without a designated floodway, no new development shall be permitted
unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and
projected development will not increase the base flood elevation (BFE)
by more than one (1) foot. (Ord. 9 of 2013, Sect. 3, Passed 12-9-2013)
3.) The Approximated Flood Plain District (FA) shall be that flood plain area
for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations have been provided.
They are shown on the maps accompanying the FIS prepared by the
FEMA. Where the specific 100 year flood elevation cannot be
determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Flood Plain Information Reports, U.S.
Geological Survey-Flood Prone Quadrangles, etc., than the applicant
for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this
elevation in accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications,
who shall certify that the technical methods used reflect correctly
currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the City. (Ord. 9 of 2013, Sect. 4, Passed
12-9-2013)
b.) Overlays:
1.) The Flood Plain Districts described above shall be overlays to the
existing underlying districts as shown on the Official Zoning Ordinance
Map, and, as such, the provisions of the flood plain districts shall serve
as a supplement to the underlying district provisions.
2.) Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of any of the Flood Plain Districts and those of any
underlying district, the most restrictive provisions and/or those
pertaining to the flood plain districts shall apply.
3.) In the event any provision concerning a Flood Plain District is declared
inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or
judicial discretion, the basic underlying district provisions shall remain
applicable.
(Ord. 11 of 1978, Sect. 3, Passed 9-25-78; Ord. 4 of 2009, Sect. 2, Passed 4-6-2009)
1314.06 DISTRICT PROVISIONS
A. All uses, activities, and development occurring within any flood plain district
shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance and with
all other applicable codes and ordinances, such as the City of Franklin Building Code, the
City of Franklin Subdivision Code and Land Development Ordinance.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any
watercourse, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system, or any other unless it
can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system in any way.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any
watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action shall have
been notified by the City of Franklin, and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office. In addition, FEMA and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Department to Community and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any
alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
The Identified Floodplain Area may be revised or modified by the Council of
the City of Franklin where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the Special
Flood Hazard Area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information becomes
available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the Special Flood Hazard Area
by submitting technical or scientific data. Technical or scientific data shall be submitted to
FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) within six (6) months of the completion of any
new construction, development, or other activity resulting in changes in the BFE. (Ord. 9 of
2013, Sect. 5, Passed 12-9-2013)

Identified Floodplain Area, any new or substantially improved residential
structure of the kind described in Section 1705.15 A. of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Franklin shall be elevated to remain
completely dry up to at least one-and-one-half (1-1/2) feet above base
flood elevation and built in accordance with all relevant sections of
Articles 1314 and 1705 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Franklin.
(4) Where permitted within any Identified Floodplain Area, any new or
substantially improved non-residential structure of the kind described in
Section 1705.15 B. of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Franklin
shall be built in accordance with all relevant sections of Lay articles
1314 and 1705 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Franklin,
including:
(a) elevated, or designed and constructed to remain completely dry
up to at least one-and-one-half (1-1/2) feet above base flood
elevation; and
(b) designed to prevent pollution from the structure or activity during
the course of a base flood.
Any such structure or part thereof that will be built below the
regulatory flood elevation shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the standards for completely dry floodproofing

Corps of Engineers, June 1972, as amended March 1992) or with some
other equivalent watertight standard.
(Ord. No. 9 of 2013, Sect. 7, Passed 12-9-2013)
D. All subdivision proposals and development proposals containing at least fifty
(50) lots or at least five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, in flood hazard areas where base
flood elevation data are not available, shall be supported by hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analyses that determine base flood elevations and floodway information. The
analyses shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer in a format required by
FEMA for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision. Submittal
requirements and processing fees shall be the responsibility of the applicant. (Ord. No. 9 of
2013, Sect. 8, Passed 12-9-2013)

the injury of others.
3.) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these
systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
4.) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owners.
5.) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community.
6.) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
7.) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed
use.
8.) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
9.) The relationship of the proposed use of the comprehensive plan and flood
plain management program for the area.
10.) The safety of access to the property in times of flooding or ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
11.) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of

1315.02 DECLARATION OF POLICY
This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by 1984
Pa. Laws 164, codified at 74 Pa. Cons. Stat. §5101 et. seq.
It is hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for endangering
the lives and property of users of the Chess Lamberton Airport, and property or
occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may affect existing and
future instrument approach minimums of the Chess Lamberton Airport; and that
an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the landing, takeoff,
and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the
Chess Lamberton Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is
declared:
2.1 that the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the
potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region
served by the Chess Lamberton Airport;
2.2 that it is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of
obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and
2.3 that the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation.
It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of hazards to
air navigation, the elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to air
navigation, or the marking and lighting of obstructions are public purposes for which a
political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in
land.

feet above mean sea level.
5.10 EXCEPTED HEIGHT LIMITATIONS - Nothing in this Ordinance shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure,
or growth of any tree to a height up to 40 feet above the surface of the
land.
1315.06 AIRPORT ZONING REQUIREMENTS
6.1 REASONABLENESS - All airport zoning regulations adopted under this
subchapter shall be reasonable; none shall impose any requirement or
restriction unless it is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of
this subchapter. In determining what regulations it may adopt, the
Franklin City Council shall consider, among other factors, the character of
the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of
the terrain within the airport hazard area, the character of the
neighborhood and the uses to which the property to be zoned is put and
adaptable.6
6.2 USE RESTRICTIONS - Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Ordinance, no use may be made of land or water within any zone
established by this Ordinance in such a manner as to create electrical
interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the
airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the
airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike
hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing,
takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
6.3 NONCONFORMING USES:
a. Regulations Not Retroactive - The regulations prescribed by this
Ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering,
or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming
to the regulations as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use,
except as provided in Section 1310.07 (relating to permits and
variances).7 Nothing contained herein shall require any change in
the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective
date of this Ordinance, and is diligently executed.
b. Marking and Lighting - Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or
tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and
maintenance thereon or nearby of such markers and lights as shall
be deemed necessary by the Airport Manager of Chess Lamberton
Airport to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and
lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of
the County of Venango.
1315.07 PERMITS AND VARIANCES
7.1 FUTURE USES8 - Except as specifically provided in a, b, or c hereunder,
no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be
erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone
hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and
granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to
the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent
with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be granted unless a variance
has been approved in accordance with this Section 1310.07, Subsection
7.4.
a. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical
zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree
or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for
such zones.
b. In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the
runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except
when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features,
such tree or structure would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such approach zones.
c. In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the
perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of
terrain, land contour, or topographic feature, would extend above
the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or
growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this Ordinance,
except that no permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of
existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of an existing structure.
7.2 EXISTING USES - Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or rebuilt or tree allowed to grow higher or replanted,
a permit must be secured from the municipality authorizing the
replacement or change. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was
on the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto or than
it is when the application for a permit is made.
7.3 NONCONFORMING USES ABANDONED OR DESTROYED - Whenever
the Code Enforcement Officer of the City of Franklin determines that a
nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80
percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from this Ordinance.
7.4 VARIANCE - Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the
height of any structure or permit the growth of any object of natural growth
or otherwise use his property in violation of airport zoning regulations may
apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from the zoning
regulations in question. A variance shall only be granted after the
requirements of Section 1310.08 are satisfied. A variance may be allowed
where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would
not be contrary to the public interest but would do substantial justice and
would be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this
Ordinance. Any variance may be granted subject to any reasonable
conditions that the Board of Adjusters may deem necessary to effectuate
the purposes of this Ordinance.9
The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination
from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on
the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable airspace. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this Ordinance may be considered by the Board of
Adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the
Airport Manager (or person of equivalent description) for advice as to the
aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport Manager (or person of
equivalent description) does not respond to the application within fifteen
(15) days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may act without such
input to grant or deny said application.
7.5 HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING10 - In granting any permit or
variance under this section, the Board shall, if it deems the action
advisable to effectuate the purposes of this Ordinance and reasonable
under the circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to require
the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit
the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person or persons
requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate, and maintain thereon
such markers and lights as may be required by guidelines or regulations
adopted by the FAA.
1315.08 ENFORCEMENT/NOTICE
8.1 LOCAL ENFORCEMENT - It shall be the duty of the Code Enforcement

1315.10 JOINT AIRPORT ZONING BOARD
10.1 JOINT AIRPORT ZONING BOARD - Where any airport hazard
appertaining to an airport is located outside the territorial limits of the
municipality encompassing the airport, the City of Franklin may, by
ordinance or resolution, create a joint airport zoning board with all of the

circumstances.
1315.12 ACQUISITION OF AIR RIGHTS
In any case in which it is desired to remove, lower, or otherwise terminate a
nonconforming structure or use, or the approach protection necessary cannot, because
of constitutional limitations, be provided by airport zoning regulations, acquisition of
property rights, rather than be airport zoning regulations, the municipality within which
the property or nonconforming use is located, or the municipality or municipal authority
owning the airport or served by it, may acquire by purchase, grant, or condemnation, in
the manner provided by the law under which municipalities are authorized to acquire
real property for public purposes, such as air right, aviation easement, or other estate or
interest in the property or nonconforming structure or use in question as may be
necessary to effectuate the purpose of this Ordinance. In the case of the purchase of
any property or any easement or estate, or interest therein, or the acquisition thereof by
the power of eminent domain, the municipality making the purchase of exercising the
power shall, in addition to the damages for the taking, injury or destruction of property,
also pay the cost of the removal and relocation of any structure or any public utility
which is required to be moved to a new location.17
1315.13 RELATION TO OTHER ZONING REGULATIONS18
13.1 Incorporation - In the event that a municipality has adopted and hereafter
adopts a comprehensive zoning ordinance regulating, among other things,
the height of buildings, any airport zoning regulations applicable to the
same area or portion thereof may be incorporated in and made a part of
the comprehensive zoning regulations and be administered and enforced
in connection therewith.
13.2 CONFLICTS - In the event of conflict between any airport zoning
regulations adopted under this Ordinance and any other regulations
applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect to the
height of structures or trees, and the use of land, or any other matter, and
whether the other regulations were adopted by the municipality which
adopted the airport zoning regulations or be some other municipality or
otherwise, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and
prevail.
1315.14 JUDICIAL REVIEW
Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by an decision of the Board of
Adjustment, may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas as provided by law. In cases
where applicable law does not provide an appeal from a municipality to a Board, a
person or taxpayer may appeal from a decision of a municipality or joint airport zoning
board, as provided by law for similar zoning proceedings.19
1315.15 SEVERABILITY
If any of the provisions of this Ordinance or the application thereof to any person
or circumstances are held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or

commenced by a municipality, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court
costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by a municipality as a result thereof.
No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied, or payable until the date of the
determination of violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the municipality may enforce the judgment pursuant to the
applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the district justice determining that there has been a violation
further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership, or
corporation violating the ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in
which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth
day following the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs, and reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of zoning
ordinances shall be paid over to the municipality whose ordinance has been violated.
The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay, upon
cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final adjudication of the violation and
judgment.
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to grant to any
person or entity other than the municipality the right to commence any action for
enforcement pursuant to this section.20
1315.18 ADOPTION AND AMENDMENT OF ORDINANCE

APPENDIX
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE HEIGHT
The following figures and formulas have been prepared for determining the
maximum allowable heights of objects within the airport's vicinity. The formulas are
used in conjunction with the figure; whereas a formula is assigned a number, that
formula corresponds with a point location of the same number on the figure. By using
the formula and following the steps outlined below, the maximum allowable height at a
point location can be determined.
1. Locate the point (object) in question on the figure (sample point locations
identified by numbers are given in various coded airport zones).
2. Apply the formula having the same number as the chosen point location to
calculate the maximum allowable height for an object at the point (some
formulas will have letter variables (A, B, C, etc.) which are shown on the
figure).

Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.”
1341.02 Authority for Ordinance and Purpose
a.) This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to Act 170 of 1988, as amended,
the “Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,” which grants the governing
body of each municipality within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania the power
to regulate subdivisions and land development by enacting a Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance.
b.) The provisions of this Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
are designed to promote, protect, and facilitate the public health, safety, morals,
general public welfare, community development, proper population density, civil
defense, and disaster evacuations; to prevent overcrowding of the land, blight,
transportation danger and congestion; to be in accord with the character of the
City of Franklin and its various parts.
1341.03 Filing Fee
The filing fee shall be as fixed by the City of Franklin by resolution. Any
additional costs of review, design, inspection, or maintenance by City officials
shall be borne by the applicant.

1341.06 Validity

appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct, or abate violations, to
prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to prevent illegal
occupancy of a building, structure, or premises. The description by metes and
bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of
selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferrer from such
penalties or from the remedies herein provided.
b.) The City may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has been
developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real property in violation of
this Ordinance or preceding regulations of the City of Franklin. This authority to
deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
(1) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(2) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or

actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(4) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired

in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the City of Franklin, pay a
judgment of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the City of Franklin as a result
thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied, or be payable until
the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice. If the defendant
neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the City of Franklin may enforce
the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice
determining that there has been a violation further determines that there was a
good faith basis for the person, partnership, or corporation violating the
ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there
shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following
the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice and thereafter
each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.

upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of
the violation and judgment.
c.) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to
grant to any person or entity other than the municipality the right to commence
any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
1341.08 Modification of Regulations
(1) The City Council may grant a modification of the requirements of one
or more provisions of this Ordinance if the literal enforcement will exact undue
hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question,
provided that such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that
the purpose and intent of this Ordinance is observed.
(2) All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall accompany
and be a part of the application for development. The request shall state in full
the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on which the request is
based, the provision or provisions of the ordinance involved and the minimum
modification necessary.
(3) All requests for modification shall first be submitted to the City
Engineer for his review and recommendations to the Planning Commission of the
City of Franklin, which shall be made within forty-five (45) calendar days of
submission.
(4) All requests for modification shall then be reviewed by the Planning
Commission of the City of Franklin; the Planning Commission will then offer
recommendations concerning the modifications.
(5) The City Council may approve, or deny the request for modification. If
the City Council approves the request for modification, it shall authorize the
minimum modification from this Ordinance that will afford relief. The City shall
keep a written record of all action on all requests for modification.
1341.09 Jurisdiction
Subdivisions and land developments submitted but not yet approved prior
to the effective date of this Ordinance will be reviewed according to Ordinance 3

1343.01 Land Suitability
Land subject to flooding and land deemed as subject to hazards to life, health, or
property, such as quarry land, open ditches, etc., shall not be subdivided for residential
uses until all such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards
against such hazards are provided by the subdivision plan, or such land is set aside for
such other uses as are appropriate to the existing conditions.
1343.02 General Requirements in Relation to Designated Flood Plain Districts
a.) Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land located in
any designated flood plain district may be planned for development with the provision
that the developer construct all buildings and structures to preclude flood damage in
accordance with this or any other laws and ordinances regulating such development.
b.) No subdivision and/or land development, or part thereof, shall be approved if
the proposed development and/or improvements will individually or collectively increase
the one hundred (100) year flood elevation more than one and one-half (1-1/2) foot at
any point.
c.) Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or accommodation
shall not be permitted in any floodway area. If fill is used to raise the elevation of the
site, the fill area shall extend out laterally for a distance of at least fifteen (15) feet
beyond the limits of the proposed structures.
d.) Building sites for structures or buildings other than for residential uses shall
also not be permitted in any floodway area. Also, such sites for structures or buildings
outside the floodway shall be protected as provided in (c) above. However, the
governing body may allow the subdivision and/or development of areas or sites for
commercial and industrial uses at an elevation below the Regulatory Flood Elevation if
the developer otherwise protects the area to that height or assures that the buildings or
structures will be flood proofed at least up to that height.
e.) If the Franklin Planning and Zoning Commission determines that only a part
of the proposed plan can be safely developed, it shall limit development to that part and
shall require that development proceed consistent with this determination.
f.) When a developer does not intend to develop the plan himself and the
Franklin Planning and Zoning Commission determines that additional controls are
required to insure safe development, it may require the developer to impose appropriate
deed restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every deed
and noted on every recorded plan.
1343.03 Street System
a.) Conformity with Official Maps and Plans - The arrangement, type, extent,
width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform with the Official Map of the City,
the Comprehensive General Plan, any Neighborhood Plan, and any other official City,
Regional, County, or State Plan which has been prepared, adopted, and/or filed as
prescribed by law.
b.) Continuance of Streets - Provisions shall be made for continuing or extending
any existing streets of adjoining subdivisions or land where such extensions may be
necessary for public service or convenience and opportunities shall be provided for
extending streets beyond the boundaries of any subdivision where such extension may
be required for public service or convenience.
c.) Relation to Topography and Proposed Use - Streets shall be logically related
to the topography so as to produce usable lots and reasonable grades and shall be in
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
d.) Minor Street Location - Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by
through traffic shall be discouraged, but provisions for street connections into and from
adjacent areas will generally be required.
e.) Subdivision Abuts an Arterial Street - Where a subdivision abuts or contains
an existing or proposed arterial street, there may be required marginal access streets,
deep lots with rear service minor streets, reversed frontage lots with screen planting
contained in a nonaccessible reservation along the rear lot line, or such other treatment
as shall provide protection for abutting lots, reduction in the number of intersections
with arterial streets, and separation of local and through traffic.
f.) Half or Partial Streets - New half or partial streets shall not be permitted,
except where essential to the reasonable subdivision of a tract and where satisfactory
assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street can be secured. Wherever
a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or partial street, the other part of the
street shall be planned with such tract.
g.) Dead-End Streets - A dead-end street shall be prohibited, except as a stub to
permit future street extension into adjoining tracts or when designed as a cul-de-sac.
Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than 400 feet and
shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around or cul-de-sac having no unpaved
island thereon, having an outside roadway diameter of at least 100 feet and a street lot
line diameter of at least 120 feet. Dead-end streets, designed to be so temporarily,
shall not be longer than one lot depth.
h.) Subdivision Borders on a Railroad or Limited Access Highway - Where a
subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway
right-of-way, there may be required a street approximately parallel to and on each side
of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening
land, as for park purposes in residential districts, and for business or industrial
purposes in appropriate districts. Such districts shall also be determined with due
regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. All
railroad crossings shall be subject to approval by the Public Utility Commission.

Where any excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing trees,
shrubs, or other vegetative cover will be removed, the developer shall consult the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service District
Representative concerning plans for erosion and sediment control. The developer will
obtain also a report on the soil characteristics of the site so that a determination can be
made as to the type and degree of development the site may accommodate.
Except as otherwise approved by the City Engineer, lots shall be laid out and
graded so that runoff from roofs, driveways, and other impervious surfaces shall be
towards the street, shall be collected either in storm sewers or in the ditches and/or
gutters along the street in short runs (400 feet or less) and shall be diverted from the
street surface into storm sewers or natural watercourses. Streets shall be located away
from watercourses unless storm sewers are to be installed.
Developers are responsible for the correction of damages caused by flood or
erosion to all properties lying downstream for three (3) years after the completion of the
development.
1343.09 Stormwater Drainage
a.) In addition to the requirements of this Ordinance, all subdivision and land
development activity shall comply with the Pennsylvania Stormwater Management Act,
Act 167 of 1978, as amended.
b.) No person, corporation, or their entity shall commit any act which will affect
normal or flood flow in any communal street or watercourse without having obtained

development sites, calculations shall be performed using one of the following, as
applicable: SCS publications, Technical Release (TR) 55 or 20, HEC I or Penn State
Runoff Model (PSRM) or Modified Rational Method. Under special circumstances other
computational methods may be used subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
l.) For the purposes of designing storm sewers, open swales, and other
stormwater runoff collection and conveyance facilities, the Rational Method or other
method as approved by the City Engineer may be applied. Rainfall intensities for
design should be obtained from the PADOT rainfall charts.
m.) Where the estimated runoff based upon any of the above methods is
doubtful, an alternate method should be studied and compared.

use or reserved for the common use of all property owners within the proposed
subdivision by covenants in the deeds. In the interest of the public welfare, at least five
(5) percent of the area of every subdivision, exclusive of streets, should be set aside for
recreational purposes. Where the tract contains less than four (4) acres, such
reservation of open space shall be combined, wherever possible, with similar
reservations in adjoining tracts. Such recreation areas and facilities shall be located in
a manner to best serve the public likely to use the same and to utilize, to the greatest
degree, any topographical features.
1343.19 Public Recreation and Open Space Areas, Planting, and Beautification
a.) In order to promote the highest environmental quality possible, the degree to
which the applicant of a subdivision or land development plan has preserved existing
salient natural features and land forms intrinsic to the site shall be assessed. Terms of
approval of a plan may be subject to the manner in which the layout or design of the
plan has preserved existing natural features, including, but not limited to, such features
as wooded area, watercourses, and escarpments.
b.) Public Recreation and Open Space Areas - Where the applicant is offering
for dedication to establish a reservation of property for public recreation or open space,
or preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a “limit of work” which will confine
excavation, earth moving procedures and other changes to the landscape, may be
required to ensure preservation and prevent despoliation of the character of the area in
open space. The location of public recreation and open space areas shall link, where
possible, with other such areas to allow for a corridor of open space.
c.) Tree Preservation - Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed unless
they are located within the proposed street cartway, the proposed building area, water
well area, sewage facility area, or within utility locations and equipment access areas.
In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level shall be maintained, if
possible.
d.) Topsoil Preservation - all of the topsoil from areas where cuts and fills have
been made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after grading. All areas of
the site shall be stabilized by grass seeding on slopes of less than ten percent (10%);
by sodding on slopes of ten percent (10%) to twenty percent (20%); and by ground
cover planting on slopes of twenty percent (20%) or greater.
e.) Landscaping - All subdivisions and land developments, with the exception of
minor subdivisions and replots, shall require a landscaping plan which shall be
prepared and submitted for approval by the City Engineer. The landscaping plan shall
include plantings such as planting strips, screening, formal gardens, shade trees, and
natural barriers.
f.) Buffer Requirements - Screen plantings are required by the City Zoning
Ordinance when any non-residential development abuts residential property.
g.) Preserved Landscaping - When there is a conscientious effort to preserve the
existing natural integrity and character of a site and where such preservation maintains
areas of woodland and trees comparable to required planting improvements (i.e.,
landscaping and buffer screening), the plan may be received in lieu of additional
landscaping requirements.

1381.01. SHORT TITLE
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Stormwater
Management Ordinance of the City of Franklin.
1381.02. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS
The Council of the City of Franklin finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from
development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities
to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management and
flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint
source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people
of the City of Franklin and all the people of the Commonwealth, their resources,
and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land
development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface
water resources by changing the natural hydro logic patterns; accelerating
stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks
thereby elevating sedimentation); destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating
aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge
for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains
surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential
component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a
program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
1381.03. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the
City of Franklin by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in
Section 1381.02 of this Ordinance through provisions intended to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 PA Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the Waters of the
Commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close
to their source, by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum of
structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards, and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and Best Management
Practices (BMPs) that are constructed and implemented.
J. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.
1381.04. STATUTORY AUTHORITY
A. Primary Authority: The City of Franklin is empowered to regulate these activities by
the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, 32 P.S., P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S.
Section 680.1 et seq., as amended, the Storm Water Management Act, and the
Home Rule Charter and Optional Plan Law, 53 Pa. C.S.A. Section 2962.
B. Secondary Authority: The City of Franklin also is empowered to regulate land use
activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805,
No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.
1381.05. APPLICABILITY
A. This Ordinance shall apply to all areas of the City of Franklin any Regulated
Activity within the City of Franklin, and all stormwater runoff entering into the City
of Franklin’s separate storm sewer system or combined sewer system from lands
within the boundaries of the City of Franklin
B. Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management controls are

1383.03. VOLUME CONTROLS
A. The Low Impact Development Practices provided in the BMP Manual shall be
utilized for all Regulated Activities to the maximum extent practicable.
B. Stormwater runoff Volume Controls shall be implemented using the Design
Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For Regulated
Activities areas greater than one (1) acre, or which require detailed design of
stormwater management facilities, the Design Storm Method shall be followed.
For Regulated Activity areas equal or less than one (1) acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Ordinance establishes
no preference for either method; therefore, the Applicant may select either
method on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on
applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology, and
other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any
sized Regulated Activity. This method requires detailed modeling based
on site conditions and shall be completed by a Qualified Professional to
include the following elements:
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume when
compared to the pre-development total runoff volume for the 2-
year/24-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
(i) Existing non-forested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for pre-development hydrologic
calculations.
(ii) Twenty (20) percent of existing impervious area, when
present within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for pre-development hydrologic
calculations for re-development.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of site
conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed.
This method is not applicable to Regulated Activities greater than one (1)
acre or for projects that require detailed design of stormwater storage
facilities. For proposed impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two (2) inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one (1) inch of runoff from proposed impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e. it
shall not be released into surface Waters of the Commonwealth.
Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff;
however, in all cases at least the first one-half (0.5) inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed elevation
of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration test shall be
conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual. A minimum 48-
hour notification to the City of Franklin shall be provided to allow
witnessing of the testing.
(3) In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltration-based best
management practices to partially fulfill the requirements in either Section
1383.03 (B)(1) or 1383.03 (B)(2), the following procedure shall be
performed and documented by a Qualified Professional:
(a) At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided to
justify the decision to not use infiltration BMPs:
(i) Description of and justification for field
infiltration/permeability testing with respect to the type of test
and test locations.
(ii) An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and
their structure as these relate to the interaction between soils
and water occurring on the site. In addition to providing soil
and soil profile descriptions, this narrative shall identify depth
to seasonal high water tables and depth to bedrock, and
provide a description of all subsurface elements (fragipans
and other restrictive layers, geology, etc.) that influence the
direction and rate of subsurface water movement.
(iii) A qualitative assessment of the site’s contribution to annual
aquifer recharge shall be made, along with identification of
any restrictions or limitations associated with the use of
engineered infiltration facilities.
(iv) The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by
the Qualified Professional.
(b) The following water quality pollutant load reductions will be required
for all disturbed areas within the proposed development:
Pollutant Load Units Required reduction
(%)
Total Suspended Solids
(TSS)
Pounds 85
Total Phosphorous (TP) Pounds 85
Total Nitrate (NO3) Pounds 50
(c) The performance criteria for water quality best management
practices shall be determined from the BMP Manual.
C. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in calculations to
establish Volume Control.
1383.04 RATE CONTROLS
A. For lands contained within Venango County that have not had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the 1-year, 2-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-
year storms.
B. For lands contained within Venango County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:

Where a wetland exists within the buffer area, the buffer shall be extended
landward to provide a minimum buffer of 25-foot, as measured perpendicularly
from the wetland boundary.
C. The buffer shall be undisturbed forest consisting of appropriate native species.
D. Where wetlands are located partially or entirely within a buffer, the buffer shall be
extended to encompass the wetland and shall be widened by a distance
sufficient to provide a 25-foot forested buffer measured perpendicularly from the
wetland boundary.
E. The following uses shall be permitted in the buffer:
(1) Footpaths, trails and bike paths provided that:
(a) Width is limited to five (5) feet;
(b) Width may be increased provided a corresponding increase in the
buffer is provided;
(c) Construction shall have minimal impact to the buffer.
(2) Stream crossings, provided the crossing is designed and constructed in
such a manner as to minimize the impact to the buffer. The riparian buffer
shall be restored to its original condition, to the maximum extent practical,
upon completion of construction.
(3) Utility lines, provided that the crossing is designed and constructed in such
a manner as to minimize the impact to the inner buffer and provided that
there is no practical alternative to locating the utility line within the buffer.

maximum extent practical, upon completion of construction.
(4) Maintenance and restoration of the riparian buffer.
(5) Projects conducted with the objective of improvement, stabilization,
restoration, or enhancement of the stream bank, stream channel,
floodplain, watershed hydrology, riparian buffers, or aquatic habitat and
maintenance activities associated with such projects. These projects
include, but are not limited to, agricultural and stormwater management
BMPs. Such projects must receive appropriate permits and approvals
from Pennsylvania DEP prior to starting the project.
(6) Minor private recreational uses for the property owner. Such uses include
benches, fire rings, and similar uses. Such uses do not include structures
such as cabins, sheds, pavilions, garages, dwellings or similar structures.
F. Disturbance of the riparian buffer shall be limited to the area necessary to
perform an allowable use.
G. Where possible and practical, disturbances shall be phased with each phase
restored prior to beginning the next phase.

management practices. In the absence of a site specific management plan, the
following maintenance guidelines apply:
(1) Buffers shall be inspected periodically for evidence of excessive sediment
deposition, erosion or concentrated flow channels. Prompt action shall be
taken to correct these problems and prevent future occurrence.
(2) Trees presenting an unusual hazard of creating downstream obstructions
shall be removed. Such material shall be removed from the floodplain or
the riparian buffer (whichever is widest), or cut into sections small enough
so as to prevent the possibility of creating obstructions downstream.
Wherever possible, large stable debris should be conserved.
(3) Vegetation should be inspected periodically to ensure diverse vegetative
cover and vigorous plant growth consistent with buffering objectives.
(a) Invasive plant species that may threaten the integrity of the buffer
shall be removed.
(b) Periodic cutting of trees may be necessary to promote vigorous
growth and encourage regeneration.
(4) Excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals
shall be avoided. These products should be used only when absolutely
necessary to maintain buffer vegetation.

a.) "Alarm System" means an assembly of equipment and devices, or a single
device such as a solid state unit, which uses electrical energy to signal the
presence of hazard requiring urgent attention such as a burglar, robbery, fire,
smoke, or need for medical assistance within a building, structure or facility, or
for alerting others to the commission of an unlawful act or hazard within the
building, structure or facility and to which firemen, policemen or public safety
officers are expected to respond, and which emits a sound or transmits a
signal or message when actuated. "Alarm System" includes, but is not limited
to, the terms "audible alarm system", "automatic hold-up alarm system",
"burglar alarm system", "Fire Alarm System" and "manual hold-up alarm
system" as those terms are hereinafter defined. Excluded from the definitions

improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50)
percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of
the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
“substantial damage” or repetitive loss” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement
of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions.
ii.) Violation: Means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s flood plain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR §60.3(b)(5),
(c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.

(12) months after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall expire, unless a time
extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain Administrator. The issuance of a
development permit does not refer to the zoning approval.
The actual start of the construction means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slapper footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied
as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the building.
Time extension shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the
applicant, who sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the Floodplain Administrator to
approve such a request and the original permit is compliant with the ordinance and
FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted.

City of Franklin shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy
terms.
3.) After the transfer of proceeds, the named insured may submit a
contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing, or securing

1735.05 ACTION BY COUNCIL
City Council shall have the power and duty to certify to the appropriateness of the

charged by law or by local ordinance with the issuance of permits for erection, demolition or
alteration of buildings or signs within the Historic District shall issue no permit for any such
building or sign changes until a certificate of appropriateness has been received from City
Council; excepting, however, the Code Enforcement Officer of the City of Franklin may issue
such permits when the only work to be done is to reconstruct, repair or restore a part of any
building or sign within the Historic District in the same style, plan, dimensions, materials and
appearance as the said part of the building existed on March 21, 1979, or as the said sign
existed on January 31, 1991. A sign shall be defined for the purposes of Article 1735 as

any public, quasi-public, civic, charitable, or religious group. (Ord. 7 of 1979, Sect. 1,
Passed 8-6-79; Ord. 3 of 1991, Sect. 1, Passed 2-18-91)

City Council, in determining whether or not to certify to the appropriateness of the
erection, reconstruction, restoration, demolition or razing of a building, in whole or in part, or
the erection or replacement of a sign, shall consider the effect which the proposed change
will have upon the general historic and architectural nature of the district. The City Council
shall pass upon the appropriateness of exterior architectural features which can be seen
from a public street or way, only, and shall consider the general design, arrangement,
texture, material and color of the building or structure, and the material, color, lettering, and
size of a sign, and the relation of such factors to similar features of buildings and structures
and signs in the district. City Council shall not consider any matters not pertinent to the
preservation of the historic aspect and nature of the district. Upon giving approval, City
Council shall issue a certificate of appropriateness authorizing a permit for the erection,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration, demolition or razing of a building, in whole or in part,
or the erection or replacement of a sign. Disapproval of City Council shall be in writing,
giving reasons therefor, and a copy thereof shall be given to the applicant, to the Code
Enforcement Officer, and any agency issuing permits and to the Pennsylvania Historical and
Museum Commission; excepting only when an applicant requests a delay in the approval or
disapproval by City Council, which delay shall not exceed thirty (30) days, approval or
disapproval by City Council shall be at its first meeting following receipt of a report from the
Board or at its first meeting after thirty-one (31) days have transpired following the filing of
an application if no report has been received from the Board; and failure of City Council to
approve or disapprove the application within said time period plus any delay required by the
applicant not to exceed thirty (30) days additional time shall constitute approval of the
application by City Council. City Council's approval or disapproval shall be issued by the
City Clerk within three (3) business days next following the Council meeting at which
approval or disapproval is made. (Ord. 1 of 1979, Sect. 1, Passed 1-15-79; Ord. 3 of 1991,

granting of a certificate of appropriateness for the said permit, and may appear before the
said meetings to explain his reasons therefor. Any such person so appearing before the
