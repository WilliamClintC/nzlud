control of the assets of the plan. The Retirement Board shall periodically review the
investment performances and methods of the trustee and any other funding agencies,

and any investment advisers. If annuities are to be purchased under the plan, the Board
shall determine what contracts should be made available to terminated participants or
purchased by the trust.

member resulting from bodily injury or disease or mental disorder contracted,
without fault or misconduct on such officer's part, from the performance of
such officer's duties in the Police Department, which renders the member

or through the intestacy laws, the beneficiary to whom the death benefit
return of contributions shall be paid.
(4) Death benefit return of accumulated contributions.
(a) In general. If a police officer dies at a time when his/her beneficiaries are not
eligible to receive a death benefit or has no beneficiaries, and has not
received any payments under a normal retirement benefit, early retirement
benefit, disability retirement benefit, or vested benefit, then the plan shall
distribute an amount equal to the amount of the police officer's accumulated
contributions plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum to the police officer's
named beneficiary(ies). If the police officer failed to designate a beneficiary
or if no designated beneficiary shall have survived the police officer, the
distribution shall be made to the estate of the police officer. [Amended
4-11-2001 by Ord. No. 428)
(b) Time of payment. A distribution under this Subsection E(4) shall be made as
soon as practicable after the beneficiary (or if none, the executor of the
officer's estate) files an election to receive the distribution.
(5) No other death benefits. Except as provided in this section, no police officer or
former police officer and no estate heir, or beneficiary of any police officer or
former police officer, shall receive any payment or benefit under this plan or from
the trust due to the death of a police officer or former police officer.

equal to the product obtained by multiplying the normal retirement benefit
determined in accordance with Subsection A using average monthly compensation
as of the date employment terminated by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
years of service to the date employment terminated and the denominator of which
is the total years of service the member would have earned if the member
continued to work to the normal retirement date.
(2) Vested benefit. A participant who terminates employment with the Borough prior
to his or her normal retirement date or early retirement date shall have a vested
benefit calculated by multiplying the member's Accrued Benefit by the following
applicable percentage:
Years of Service
Less than 12 years
12 years or more
Vesting Percentage
0%
100%
(3) The participant's vested benefit shall be payable commencing on his or her normal
retirement date. If the participant has met the service requirement for early
retirement, he or she may elect to commence to receive the vested benefit as of the
first of any month on or after his or her early retirement date.

upon the recommendation of the Police Pension Committee, to provide by resolution for
a cost-of-living increase for those participants in the plan receiving retirement benefits
and who qualify under applicable law. These cost-of-living increases may be granted;
provided, however, that such cost-of-living increase shall not exceed the following:
(1) The percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index from the year in which the
police officer last worked.
(2) In no case shall the total police pension benefits exceed 75% of the salary used for
computing basic retirement benefits.
(3) The total cost-of-living increase shall not exceed 30%.
(4) No cost-of-living increase shall be granted which would impair the actuarial
soundness of the Borough of Birdsboro Police Pension Plan. Prior to the
recommendation of the cost-of-living increase, the Police Pension Committee shall
direct the fund actuary to submit a written cost estimate of the funding cost for
such an adjustment.
H. Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP).
(1) Eligibility. Effective January 1, 2007, members of the Birdsboro Police
Department who have not retired prior to the implementation of DROP (Ordinance
No. 403, adopted 12-4-2006) may enter into DROP on the first day of any month
following completion of 25 years of credited service and attaining the age of 50.
(2) Written election. A member of the Police Department electing to participate in
DROP must complete and execute a DROP Option Form prepared by the Borough
of Birdsboro, which shall evidence the member's participation in DROP. The form
must be signed by the member, notarized, and submitted to the Borough of
Birdsboro prior to the date on which the member wishes the DROP option to be
effective; the DROP option notice shall include an irrevocable notice to the
Borough by the member that the member shall resign from employment with the
Birdsboro Police Department effective on a specific date (the "resignation date").
In no event shall the resignation date be longer than 60 months from the execution
of the DROP Option Form. An officer shall cease to work as a Borough Police
Officer on the officer's resignation date, unless the Borough terminates or
honorably discharges the officer prior to the resignation date. In addition, all
retirement documents required by the police pension administrator must be filed
and presented to the Pension Board for approval of retirement and payment of
pension. Once a retirement application has been approved, it is irrevocable.
(3) Limitation on pension accrual. After the effective date of the DROP option, the
member shall no longer earn or accrue additional years of continuous service for
pens10n purposes.
(4) Benefit calculation. For all retirement fund purposes, continuous service of a
member participating in DROP shall remain as it existed on the effective date of
commencement of participation in DROP. Service thereafter shall not be
38:20 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 38-20 PENSIONS § 38-20
recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by
the Borough of Birdsboro Police Pension Fund. Upon entry into the DROP
program, the employee and the employer contributions to the plan shall no longer
be required. The average applicable compensation of the member for pension
calculation purposes shall remain as it existed on the effective date of
commencement of participation in DROP. Earnings or increases in earnings
thereafter shall not be recognized or used for the calculation or determination of
any benefits payable by the pension fund. The pension benefit payable to the
members shall increase only as a result of cost-of-living adjustments in effect on
the effective date of the member's participation in DROP or be applicable cost of
living adjustments granted thereafter.
(5) Payments to the DROP account. The monthly retirement benefits that would have
been payable had the member elected to cease employment and receive a normal
retirement benefit shall, upon the member commencing participation in DROP, be
paid into the separate account established to receive the participant's monthly
pension payments. This account shall be designated the DROP account.
(6) Accrual of nonpension benefits. After an officer elects to participate in DROP, all
other contractual benefits shall continue to accrue with the exception of those
provisions relating to the Police Pension Plan and the buy-back of accrued, unused,
sick, or vacation time. Sick time buy-back shall occur at time of entry into DROP.
An officer may earn and utilize leave time during the DROP period, but the
Borough shall not be required to buy-back any such unused leave time at the end
of the DROP period.
(7) Payout. Upon the termination date set forth in the member's DROP option notice
or such date as the Borough separates the member from employment, the
retirement benefits payable to the member or member's beneficiary, if applicable,
shall be paid to the member or beneficiary and shall no longer be paid to the
member's deferred retirement option account. Within 30 days following
termination of a member's employment pursuant to their participating in the DROP
program, the balance in the member's DROP account shall be paid to the member
in a single lump sum payment or, at the member's option, in any fashion permitted
by law.
(8) Disability during DROP. If a bargaining unit member becomes temporarily
incapacitated during his participation in DROP, that member shall continue to
participate in DROP as if fully employed. The member shall receive disability pay
in the same amount as disabled police officers that are not participating in DROP.
In no event shall a member on temporary disability have the ability to draw from
this DROP account. However, notwithstanding any other provision in this
subsection, if an officer is disabled and has not returned to work as of the date of
his required resignation, then such resignation shall take precedence over all other
provisions herein, and said officer shall be required to resign. Nothing contained in
this plan shall be construed as conferring any legal rights upon any police

A. No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter "insurer") doing business in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage
to a structure located within the Borough of Birdsboro where the amount recoverable for
the fire loss to the structure under all policies exceeds $7,500, unless the insurer is
furnished by the Borough Treasurer with a certificate pursuant to § 508(b) of the
Insurance Company Law of 1921 (40 P.S. § 638) (the "Act"), and unless there is
compliance with the procedures set forth in§ 508(c) of the Act.
B. Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against the
property ("municipal claims"), or there are expenses which the Borough has incurred as a
cost for the removal, repair or securing of a building or other structure on the property
(collectively "municipal expenses"), the Secretary of the Borough shall immediately
render a bill for such work, if he has not already done so. Upon written request of the
named insured specifying the tax description of the property, the name and address of the
insurer and the date of receipt by the insurer of a loss report of the claim, the Treasurer
shall furnish, within 14 working days after the request to the insurer, a certificate (or at

property.

bill for such amounts.
(3) Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed delinquent for this
purpose if a lien could have been filed for such claims under applicable law. Upon
receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to Subsection A of this section, the insurer
shall transfer to the Treasurer an amount from the insurance proceeds sufficient to
pay such sums prior to making payment to the named insured, subject to the
provisions of Subsection C hereof.

C. When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid pursuant to
Subsection B of this section, or where the Treasurer has issued a certificate described in
Subsection B( 1) indicating that there are no municipal claims or municipal expenses
against the property, the insurer shall pay the claim of the named insured; provided,
however, that if the loss agreed upon by the named insured and the insurer equals or
exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building
or structure, the following procedures must be followed:
(1) The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Treasurer, in the
aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or fraction thereof.
(2) If at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured, such insured has submitted
to the insurer, with a copy to the Borough, a contractor's signed estimate of the
cost of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure in an amount
less than the amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the insurer
shall transfer to the Treasurer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in
the estimate. If there is more than one insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on
a pro rata basis by all insurers insuring the building or other structure.
(3) Upon receipt of the above described portion of the insurance proceeds, the
Treasurer shall do the following:
(a) Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security against the
total municipal expenses anticipated by the Borough to be required in
removing, repairing or securing the building or structure as required by this
chapter. Such costs shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal or
administrative costs incurred by the Borough in connection with such
removal, repair or securing or any proceedings related thereto; and
(b) Mail to the named insured, at the address received from the insurer, a notice
the proceeds have been received by the Borough and that the procedures
under this subsection shall be followed.
(c) After the transfer, the named insured may submit to the Borough a
contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure, in which event the Treasurer shall, if such
estimated is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to the insured
the amount of the funds transferred to the Borough in excess of that required
to pay the municipal expenses, provided the Borough has not commenced to
remove, repair or secure the building or other structure, in which case the
Borough will complete the work.
(d) Pay to the Borough Secretary, for reimbursement to the Borough general
fund, the amount of the municipal expenses paid by the Borough.
(e) Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the named insured
upon receipt of a cer~ificate issued by the Borough Secretary that the repair,
removal or securing of the building or other structure has been completed in

§ 173-1. Title.
This chapter will be known as the "Garage and Yard Sale Permit and Regulation Ordinance."
§ 173-2. Purpose.
The rules and regulations set forth herein are designed to control and restrict garage and yard
sales in order to protect the public health, safety and convenience and to restrict such sales to
casual and/or occasional occurrences only, in keeping with the character of the neighborhood
wherein this activity is carried on and in compliance with Chapter 395, Zoning, of the Code
of the Borough of Birdsboro, Berks County, Pennsylvania. The intent of this chapter is to
eliminate unregulated, perpetual, prolonged and extended garage and yard sales in residential
areas and to maintain regulatory powers over garage and yard sales in all areas. Such sales, if
continued indefinitely, tend to become retail businesses in residential areas and zones, create a
nuisance, and often violate the zoning regulations of this Borough. The provisions of this
chapter arise from the need to limit, restrict and control garage and yard sales. It is not the
intent of this chapter to change or amend Chapter 395, Zoning, or any other ordinances within
the Borough of Birdsboro which may, in any manner or fashion, regulate businesses.

C. The permissible hours for any yard sale herein shall be 7:00 a.m. until sunset.
§ 173-5. Signs and advertising.

the Borough limits, or any individual group or corporation posting advertisements within the
Borough limits for a garage sale to be held inside or outside the Borough limits will remove
within the Borough right-of-way all signs, flyers, posters and bulletins no later than the day
after the garage sale. Should the garage sale for any reason not be held, all signs, flyers,
posters and bulletins advertising the garage sale must be removed no later than the scheduled
last day for the garage sale.
§ 173-6. Enforcement.
A. This chapter will be enforced by the Code Enforcement Officer of the Borough of
Birdsboro, and it will be the duty of that officer to investigate and prosecute any
violation of this chapter.
B. If after investigation a violation is found to exist, the Code Enforcement Officer will
prosecute a complaint before the Magisterial District Judge serving the Borough of
Birdsboro pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

§ 198-1. Purpose.
The Borough Council of the Borough of Birdsboro finds it in the best interests of the residents of the
Borough of Birdsboro, Berks County, Pennsylvania, to provide for certain protections and safeguards in
order to address deteriorated properties, public nuisances, and properties in serious violation of state law
or municipal codes of the Borough of Birdsboro. Such protections and safeguards include the denial of
permits, as well as the ability to bring actions at law and in equity in order to address deteriorated properties
which have an impact on crime, the quality of life of our residents, and which would require
expenditures of public funds in order to abate and correct such nuisances, violations, and delinquent
municipal services accounts.
§ 198-2. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
BOARD  Shall mean a zoning hearing board or other body granted jurisdiction to render decisions in

lender, who possesses and controls the real estate. The term includes but is not limited to, heirs, assigns,

to be a serious violation.
STATE LAW  A statute of the Commonwealth or a regulation of an agency charged with administration
and enforcement of Commonwealth law.
SUBSTANTIAL STEP  An affirmative action as determined by a Borough official or officer of the
court on the part of the property owner or managing agent to remedy a serious violation of state law or
Borough Code including, but not limited to, physical improvements or repairs to the property.

Tax Sale Law (P.L. 1368, No. 542), the Municipal Claim and Tax Lien Law (P.L. 207, No. 153) or the
Second Class City Treasurers' Sale and Collection Act (P.L. 876, No. 171) located in any municipality
in this Commonwealth.
§ 198-3. Legal action to be taken against owners.

agency or court. Notwithstanding any law limiting the form of action for the recovery of penalties
by a municipality for the violation of a Borough Code, the Borough may recover, in a single
action under this section, an amount equal to the penalties imposed against the owner and any
costs of remediation lawfully incurred by, or on behalf of, the Borough to remedy any code violation.

Borough Code or is regarded as a public nuisance after a judgment, decree, or order is entered by
a court of competent jurisdiction against the owner of the property for an adjudication under

that is an association or trust, this does not authorize a lien to be placed upon the individual assets

or trust except as otherwise allowed by law.
§ 198-4. Out-of-state owners; service of process upon associations and trusts.

who has been properly notified of the violations, may be extradited to this Commonwealth to
face criminal prosecution to the full extent allowed and in the manner authorized by 42 Pa. C.S.
Chapter 91 (relating to detainers and extradition).

or other applicable code violations for any real property owned by an association or trust cannot
be accomplished by handing a copy of the notice or citation to an executive officer, partner, or
trustee of the association or trust or to the manager, trustee, or clerk in charge of the property, the
delivery of the notice or citation may occur by registered, certified, or United States express mail,
accompanied by a delivery confirmation:
(1) To the registered office of the association or trust; or
(2) Where the association or trust does not have registered office, to the mailing address used
for real estate tax collection purposes, if accompanied by the posting of a conspicuous
notice on the property and by handing a copy of the notice or citation to the person in
charge of the property at that time.
§ 198-5. Permit denials.

owns real property in any municipality in this Commonwealth for which there exists on the real
property:

(2) A serious violation and the owner has taken no substantial step to correct the serious violation
within six months following notification of the violation and for which fines, penalties,
or a judgment to abate or correct were imposed by a magisterial district judge or
municipal court or a judgment at law or in equity was imposed by a court of common
pleas. No denial shall be permitted if a judgment is subject to a stay or supersedes by order
of court, or if the municipal permit is necessary to correct a violation of state law or Borough
Code.
§ 198-6 BIRDSBORO CODE § 198-6
01-04-2016 198:4
B. The municipal permit denial as above described shall not apply to an applicant's delinquency on
taxes and/or municipal services charges that are under appeal or otherwise contested through a
court or administrative process.
C. In issuing a denial of a municipal permit, the Borough or the Board shall indicate the street
address, the municipality and county in which the property is located and the court and docket

may request a letter of compliance from the appropriate state agency, municipality, or school district
in the form specified by such entity.
D. All municipal permits denied in accordance with this section may be withheld by the Borough

applicable codes; or
(3) The owner of the property has presented and the appropriate entity has accepted a plan to
begin remediation of a serious violation of state law, Borough Code, or other applicable

days of the request, the property shall be deemed to be in compliance for the purposes of this section.
The appropriate state agency, municipality, or school district shall specify the form in which
the request for a compliance letter shall be made. Such letters shall be verified by the appropriate
municipal officials before issuing to the applicant a municipal permit.
F. Boards, including the Borough Zoning Hearing Board, may deny approval of municipal permits
 which includes special exception approval and variance relief  if warranted as set forth above
to the extent that approval of such a municipal permit is within the jurisdiction of the Board.
G. The Borough may appear to present evidence that the applicant is subject to denial by a Board in
accordance with this Section.
H. A municipal permit may only be denied to an applicant other than an owner if the applicant is acting
under the direction or with the permission of the owner and that owner owns real property
that is subject to denial as set forth hereinabove.
§ 198-6. Inherited property relief.
Where property is inherited by will or intestacy, the devisee or heir shall be given the opportunity to
make payments on reasonable terms to correct code violations or to enter into a remediation agreement
with the Borough to avoid subjecting the devisee's or heir's other properties to asset attachment or denial
of municipal permits and approvals on other properties owned by the devisee or heir. Such opportunity
shall be given at the Borough's discretion and subject to the revocation upon the devisee or heir's failure
to proceed with a payment plan, or to progress forward and complete a remediation plan.

discharges to the above-described concentrations which will not harm the sewer
system, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or will not
otherwise endanger lives, limb or public property, or constitute a nuisance. The
Borough may set lower limitations in specific cases if, in the opinion of the
Borough, said actions will be consistent with the above-stated objective. In the
setting of such lower limitations, the Borough will give consideration to such
factors as the volume of wastewater flow in relation to flows and velocities in the
sewers, degree of treatability of the waste and other pertinent factors. The Borough
reserves the right to reevaluate and revise the limitations as needed. The more
stringent of EPA or P ADEP requirements and limitations shall apply in any case
where either is more stringent than those in this section. An industrial user
classified as a categorical industrial user shall be required to meet the EPA
Categorical Standards, if such standards are more stringent than the local discharge
limitations.

N. Quantities of flow or concentrations, or both, which constitute a "slug" as defined
§ 303-3 of this chapter.
0. Any waters which are used for the purpose of diluting wastes which would otherwise
exceed applicable maximum concentration limitations. The Borough may impose mass
limitation on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate.
P. Containing any substance which will cause the sewage treatment plant to violate its
NPDES permit or the receiving water quality standards, causing pass-through or
interference.
Q. Containing any substance which may cause the sewage treatment plant effluent or any
other product of the sewage treatment plant thereof such as residues, biosolids or scums
to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In
no case, shall a substance discharged to the sewer system cause the sewage treatment
plant to be in noncompliance with biosolids use or disposal criteria, guidelines or
regulations developed under § 405 of the Clean Water Act, any criteria, guidelines or
regulations affecting biosolids use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or a P ADEP criteria

the same person and irrespective of the fact that each such billing unit is not connected
separately and independently with the sewer system.
§ 303-63. Metered service.
A. Except upon special written permission granted by the Borough and upon good cause
shown, each connection unit shall be required to have installed a water meter or water
meters to measure the quantity of water used by such connection unit for the purpose of
computing sewer rentals or charges hereunder.
B. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, sewer rentals or charges for domestic
wastes and nondomestic wastes discharged into the sewer system from any improved
property shall be based upon the volume of water usage, adjusted, if appropriate, as
provided in this chapter, based upon the metered volume of water used at such improved
property, whether in connection with the applicable water system or otherwise.
C. Sewer rentals or charges for domestic waste and nondomestic waste discharged into the
sewer system from any improved property may be based upon actual metered volume of
domestic waste and nondomestic waste discharge, as permitted in this article .

to be served through a common water meter or through a common sewage discharge
meter for the purpose of computing sewer rentals or charges hereunder, a multiple rental
or charge per quarter shall be imposed, which rental or charge shall be calculated in the
following manner:
(1) The total consumption of water through such common water meter or the total
discharge through such common sewage discharge meter shall be divided by the
number of billing units served thereby;
303:33 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 303-65 BIRDSBORO CODE § 303-68
(2) The metered rate schedule for computing sewer rentals or charges referred to under
§ 303-69 shall be applied to the resultant quotient; and
(3) The resultant pro rata rental or charge for each billing unit shall be multiplied by
the number of such billing units receiving water service through such common
water meter or discharging sewage through such common sewage discharge meter
to arrive at the total bill for all such billing units served through the common
meter; provided, however, that there shall be charged a minimum sewer rental or
charge for each such billing unit.
§ 303-66. Discharge of potable water into watercourses other than the sewer system.

substantial portions of their potable water use discharged, uncontaminated, to conduits or
watercourses other than the sewer system shall install and maintain a meter, of design
and quality suitable to the Borough Engineer, on all pipelines so used.
B. Readings or the recordings of these meters shall be made concurrent with regular water
meter readings. For purposes of billing these nondomestic users for sewer service, the
Borough will deduct the reading of the second meter for water not discharged into the
sewer system from the potable water meter before sewer rentals or charges are computed.
§ 303-67. Cost of sample analysis.
A. All costs incurred by the Borough in collecting and analyzing samples in connection with
determining a strong waste discharge or with monitoring nondomestic waste to determine
compliance with Article IX of this chapter shall be billed by the Borough directly to the
nondomestic user whose wastewater is sampled.
B. Such user may request that additional samples be taken in addition to the normal periodic
samples taken by the Borough. The cost of collecting any such normal or additional
samples and making the analysis shall be borne by the user/owner.
§ 303-68. Charge for failure to comply with provisions.
If the owner of any improved property shall fail to provide the Borough with the complete
information required to compute the sewer rentals or charges to such improved property, or
additional tapping fees to be charged, if applicable, the Borough may estimate a reasonable
applicable sewer rental or charge and additional tapping fees, as applicable, for such improved
property and such estimated sewer rentals or charges or additional tapping fee shall be the
actual sewer rentals or charges or tapping fee payable until the required information is filed;
provided, however, that no rebate shall be paid by the Borough if the information filed reveals
lower sewer rentals or charges or tapping fee, where applicable, than that estimated by the
Borough. But if the facts indicate higher sewer rentals or charges or tapping fee were
warranted by the terms hereof, such additional sewer rentals or charges or tapping fee, where
applicable, shall be paid by the user.

A. In order to determine the additional charge for nondomestic wastes with strength greater
than that of normal domestic waste, the following formula shall be used:
Sq= 0.00834 Q1 [BOD5 - 300) TA+ (SS 1 - 300) TB+ NH3N - 25) TC]
Where:
Sq= the quarterly surcharge to be added to the quarterly sewer rental or charge
0.00834 = a constant to convert waste strength expressed in mg/I to thousand
pounds of waste
Q, = the quarterly volume of nondomestic waste flow expressed in millions of
gallons
BODs = the 5-day BOD of the nondomestic waste expressed in mg/I
SS, = the total suspended solids in mg/I of the nondomestic waste
NHJN = the ammonia nitrogen in mg/I of the nondomestic waste
300, 300 and 25 = constants expressing waste-load strength of domestic waste in
mg/I for the respective pollutant parameters
TA represents the cost incurred by the Borough in treating 1,000 pounds of BOD5;
TB represents the cost of treating 1,000 pounds of total suspended solids; and TC
represents the cost of treating 1,000 pounds of ammonia nitrogen. TA, TB and TC
vary each year as sewage treatment plant operations and maintenance costs change.
Therefore, TA, TB and TC shall be determined at the beginning of each year by the
Borough, based upon budgeted operating costs, and adopted by ordinance.
B. When a value of BODs and/or total suspended solids of a nondomestic waste is less than
300 milligrams per liter (mg/I), the value of 300 shall be used in the calculation of the
strong waste discharge in place of the actual value which is less than 300 milligrams per
liter (mg/I). When a value of ammonia nitrogen is less than 25 milligrams per liter
(mg/I), the value of 25 shall be used in the calculation in place of the actual value which
is less than 25 milligrams per liter (mg/I).
§ 303-73. Inspection, sampling and analysis.
A. Representative sampling point. All users proposing to discharge or intending to continue
to discharge commercial or industrial wastewater to any part of the sewer system must
make available a sampling point representative of the discharge which is acceptable to,
and approved by, the Borough. This point must be available to the Borough and its duly
authorized agents, P ADEP or EPA, for purposes of conducting sampling inspections,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
B. Nondomestic/industrial waste being discharged into the sewer system shall be subject to
periodic sampling and inspection by the Borough or its agent to be used as a basis for
determining additional charges due to excessive concentrations for BOD5, total suspended
303:36 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 303-73 SEWERS AND SEW AGE DISPOSAL § 303-74
solids and/or ammonia nitrogen and substances prohibited in Article IV of this chapter.
Such sampling and inspection shall be the basis for computing strong waste surcharges in
accordance with this section.
C. All sampling shall be of a representative manner and in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12.
The collection and analysis of samples obtained shall be made in accordance with EPA
methodology and procedures, including 40 CFR, Part 136, as amended.
D. Sampling frequency. Sampling of wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determinations will be done at such intervals as the Borough may designate. It is the
intention of the Borough to conduct compliance sampling or to cause such sampling to
be conducted for all nondomestic waste users at least once in every calendar year.
§ 303-74. Measurement of volume.
A. Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a private or public water
supply discharges only nondomestic/industrial waste into the sewer system, the volume
of water purchased shall be used as a measure of the quantity of nondomestic/industrial
waste discharged.
B. Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a private or public source
discharges combined domestic waste and nondomestic waste/industrial waste into the
sewer system, the total volume of water purchased shall be used to determine that
person's sewer charge and/or his strong waste surcharge .
C. Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a private or public supply
and discharging nondomestic/industrial waste into the sewer system also discharges
unpolluted cooling water to either a storm sewer or other outlet, an allowance for the
amount of water so discharged shall be made in computing the sewer charge. The person
discharging cooling water shall, at his own expense, install a meter(s), as required, to
indicate accurately the amount of water claimed as a credit.
D. Whenever a person using a private water supply discharges nondomestic/industrial waste
into the sewer system, the charges for such discharge shall be in accordance with Articles
VIII, IX and X of this part. Such person, however, shall install, at his expense, a suitable
meter(s) to measure the total volume of water used or shall install, at his expense, a
meter on the sewer line leaving the plant so as to measure the entire flow of waste
discharged into the sewer system. No meter for measurement either of water or sewage
shall be installed until a plan for such installation is approved by the Borough. All meters
or other measuring devices installed or required to be used under the provisions of this
article shall be tested, inspected or repaired as required by the Borough. The owner of
the property upon which such measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its
maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at the property
owner's expense.
E. The Borough shall be responsible for reading of water and/or sewage meters when
installed in industrial establishments within its jurisdiction. All meters shall be accessible
to the Borough or its agent at all times.

Determination of Charges for Industrial Waste.
§ 303-76. Charges imposed for industrial waste.
There shall be additional sewer service charges for industrial users of the sewer system.
§ 303-77. Industrial waste surcharge.
Industrial waste surcharges shall be calculated in accordance with the methods set forth under
strong waste surcharges in Article IX of this part.
§ 303-78. Industrial cost recovery payments.
A. Industrial cost recovery charges are hereby imposed upon and shall be collected from the
owner of each industrial user which shall be connected to the treatment works for use of
the treatment works and which industrial users discharge wastewater other than domestic
sewage. Said charges shall commence and shall be effective as of the enactment date of
this chapter.
B. In order to determine the industrial cost recovery charge, the following formula shall be
used:
ICRQ = 0.137 Qi [1,034.54 + (4.906 BOD1) + (1.73 SS1)]
Where:
ICRQ = the quarterly industrial cost recovery charge expressed in dollars
Q1 = the total quarterly wastewater discharge expressed in million gallons
BOD1 and SS1 = the respective concentrations of BODs and suspended solids of the
wastewater discharged expressed in mg/l.
§ 303-79. Methods of payment of extra charges by industrial users.
A. The industrial cost recovery charge and the industrial waste surcharge shall be payable
quarterly. The Borough shall cause the water meter of each industrial user where the
wastewater flow determination is based upon metered water consumption, and the
wastewater meter where the wastewater flow determination is based upon wastewater
flow measurement, to be read on a quarterly basis and shall cause industrial cost
303:38 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 303-79 SEWERS AND SEW AGE DISPOSAL § 303-83
recovery bills and industrial waste surcharge bills to be mailed forthwith following each
reading.
B. The Borough shall cause periodic sampling of the wastewater discharged by each
industrial user in accordance with § 303-54 of this chapter.
C. The analysis of the sample shall be the basis for computing industrial cost recovery
charges and industrial waste surcharges.
D. Bills for industrial cost recovery and industrial waste surcharge shall be mailed to the
owner's address specified on the industrial waste discharge permit. Failure to receive a
bill as a result of incorrect address, or otherwise, shall not excuse nonpayment of charges
or extend the time for payment.
E. If any quarterly industrial cost recovery or industrial waste surcharge payment is not
made within 30 days after the date of the bill, a ten-percent penalty shall be added
thereto, and if the installment plus penalty is not paid within 60 days after the date of the
bill, the aggregate amount thereof shall bear interest from the penalty date at the rate of
112% per month or fraction thereof. Any unpaid bills (together with penalties and interest
thereon to the extent permitted by law) shall be a lien on the property served, which may
be collected by action in assumpsit, by distress or by a lien filed in the nature of a
municipal claim, as provided by law.
§ 303-80. New industrial users .
A new industrial user is one which connects to the treatment works after the effective date of
this chapter. Industrial cost recovery payments by a new industrial user shall begin on the date
treatment works use is initiated and shall continue for the unexpired portion of the industrial
cost recovery period or until the industrial user ceases use of this facility, whichever occurs
first. The industrial cost recovery period shall begin with the enactment date of this chapter
and continue for a period of 20 years. Industrial waste surcharge payments by a new industrial
user shall begin on the date treatment works use is initiated and continue indefinitely.
§ 303-81. Discontinuance of use.
If an industrial user discontinues use of the treatment works, its payment for industrial cost
recovery and for industrial waste surcharges will cease.
§ 303-82. Lump sum industrial cost recovery payment.
An industrial user may fulfill its industrial cost recovery obligation by making a lump sum
payment for its entire share of the cost of the construction of the treatment works. Such a
payment plan will be arranged upon request by an industrial user.
§ 303-83. Administrative appeal procedure.
Industrial users may appeal the reasonableness of the allocations and industrial cost recovery
or industrial waste surcharge assessments imposed upon them. Industrial users making such an
303:39 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 303-83 BIRDSBORO CODE § 303-85
appeal shall so notify the Borough, in writing. A hearing board will be appointed and an
administrative hearing will then be conducted. The industrial user will be given the
opportunity to present testimony before the hearing board supporting its appeal. The hearing
board shall consist of three members of the Authority and two members of Borough Council
to be selected by vote of the Authority.
§ 303-84. Additional surcharges.
The formula specified in § 303-77 of this article is to determine additional charges or
surcharges for the treatment of industrial waste. It is, however, recognized by the Borough
that the discharge of any waste or other material which contain any one or more of the
prohibited or limited substances listed in §§ 303-36 and 303-38 of this chapter may result in
extraordinary labor, maintenance and/or treatment expenses to the Borough. Hence, it shall be
the policy of the Borough, in the event of the discharge of any industrial waste or other matter
or containing any one of the prohibited substances listed in §§ 303-36 and 303-38 of this
chapter, to bill the owner of the property from which the said discharge is made an additional
surcharge of $100. Each day that the said discharge is made may result in a separate $100
additional surcharge. This one-hundred-dollar charge shall be in addition to the normal sewer
rental and/or any extra industrial waste charges incurred under this section.
ARTICLE XI
Time and Method of Payment.
§ 303-85. Payment terms established.
A. The tapping fee, connection fee and permit and inspection fees imposed by §§ 303-59,
303-60 and 303-61 of this part shall be payable upon application for a permit to make the
connection. The sewer rents imposed by Article VIII shall be payable quarterly.
B. All bills with respect to billing units shall be rendered each calendar quarter on January
1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year for service during the preceding quarter
annum.
C. All bills shall be due and payable without penalty one day after mailing or delivery by or
in behalf of the Borough to the person responsible for payment thereof. If any quarterly
installment of sewer rent is not paid within 30 days after the date of the bill, a
ten-percent penalty shall be added thereto, and if the installment plus penalty is not paid
within 60 days after the date of the bill, the aggregate amount thereof shall bear interest
from the penalty date at the rate of 112% per month or fraction thereof. Payments mailed
and postmarked on or before such 30th day shall be deemed to be payments within the
period allowed for payment without penalty. If such 30th day shall be a legal holiday or
a Sunday, payments made on or mailed and postmarked on the next succeeding business
day not a legal holiday shall be deemed to be payments within the period allowed for
payment without penalty.
D. Any unpaid sewer rent (together with penalties and interest thereon to the extent
permitted by law) shall be a lien on the property served, which may be collected by
action in assumpsit, by distress or by a lien filed in the nature of a municipal claim, as
303:40 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 303-85 SEWERS AND SEW AGE DISPOSAL § 303-88
provided by law. In addition, the Borough may require any water utility to shut off the
water supply to any property with respect to which the sewer rent imposed hereby is
unpaid until all such rents, together with interest and penalties as aforesaid, are paid.
E. Whenever service to any billing unit shall begin after the first day or shall terminate
before the last day of any calendar quarter, the sewer rental or charge for such period
shall be prorated equitably for that portion of the calendar quarter during which service
was provided by the Borough.
F. Every owner of improved property which is connected to the sewer system initially shall
provide the Borough with and thereafter shall keep the Borough advised of his correct
address. Failure of any person to receive quarterly bills for sewer rentals or charges shall
not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor shall such failure result in an extension
of the period of time during which such bill shall be payable without penalty.
§ 303-86. Liens for sewer rentals and charges; filing and collection of liens.
The sewer rentals or charges hereby imposed shall be a lien on the improved property
connected to and served by the sewer system from the date such sewer rental or charge
becomes due and payable under provisions of this article. All sewer rentals or charges hereby
imposed which shall not be paid after 30 days, as provided in § 303-85C of this article, shall
be entered as a lien against the improved property so connected to and served by the sewer
system, which lien shall be filed in the office of the Prothonotary of Berks County,
Pennsylvania, in the manner provided by law for the filing of municipal claims. All delinquent
bills shall be collected by the Borough in any manner permitted and authorized by law.
§ 303-87. Additions to and changes of sewer rentals and charges; adoption of additional
rules and regulations.
A. The Borough reserves the right to adopt and promulgate and, from time to time, the

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
The governing body of the Borough finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development
throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers,
greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and
safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public
health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the Borough and all the people
of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
325:2 07 - 01 - 2011

B. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
C. Encourage recharge of groundwater, where appropriate, and prevent degradation of
groundwater quality.
D. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the Borough and the
commonwealth.
E. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
F. Provide proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management facilities and
BMPs that are constructed in the Borough.
G. Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershed-wide stormwater
management and planning.
H. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain existing uses and maintain the level of water
quality to support those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in
special protection streams.
I. Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES permit
requirements.
J. Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to address
nonstormwater discharges into the Borough's separate storm sewer system.
K. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.

ARTICLE III
Stormwater Management
A. All regulated activities in the Borough which do not fall under the exemption criteria
shown in § 325-22 shall submit a drainage plan consistent with this chapter to the
Borough for review. This criteria shall apply to the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages. Impervious cover shall include, but not be limited
to, any roof, parking or driveway areas and any new streets and sidewalks. Any areas
designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed to be impervious for the
purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria.
B. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit unimpeded flow along
natural watercourses, except as modified by stormwater management facilities or open
channels consistent with the Code.
C. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto adjacent property shall
not be altered without permission of the affected property owner(s) and shall be subject
to any applicable discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
D. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable discharge
criteria in the general direction of existing discharge, whether proposed to be
concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by
this chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent
property, the developer must document that adequate downstream conveyance facilities
exist to safely transport the concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated discharge.
Diffused flow shall not be concentrated onto adjacent property without permission of the
affected property owner(s).
E. Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage easements shall be
provided conforming to the line of such watercourses. The terms of the easement shall
prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may
adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement unless the
owner has obtained approval from the Borough. Also, maintenance, including mowing of
vegetation within the easement, shall be required, except as approved by the appropriate
governing authority.

§ 325-7 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 325-8
F. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural drainageways on the
site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels may be constructed
conforming substantially to the line and grade of such natural drainageways. Work within
natural drainageways shall be subject to approval of appropriate state, federal and local
permitting processes.
G. Where deemed appropriate, any stormwater management facilities regulated by this
chapter that would be located in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth or wetlands
shall be subject to approval by state and federal regulations and the appropriate permit
application process. When there is a question whether a permit may be required, it is the
responsibility of the developer or his agent to show that state or federal approval is not
required. The applicant shall provide evidence of these approvals, prior to final plan
approval.
H. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that would be located on
state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation (PennDOT).
I. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through seepage beds,
infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged, where soil conditions permit, to reduce the size
or eliminate the need for detention facilities.
J. Roof drains shall not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers or roadside ditches
to promote overland flow and infiltration/percolation of stormwater where advantageous
to do so. When it is more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers,
then it shall be permitted on a case-by-case basis by ·the Borough as recommended by the
Borough Engineer.
§ 325-8. Stormwater management districts.
In addition to the requirements specified below, the groundwater recharge (§ 325-14) and
water quality(§ 325-15) requirements shall be implemented.
A. The Schuylkill River Watershed has been divided into stormwater management districts
as shown on the Watershed Map in Appendix D.J
(1) In addition to the requirements specified in the table below, the groundwater
recharge (§ 325-14), water quality (§ 325-15) and streambank erosion control
(§ 325-16) requirements shall be implemented.
(2) Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the Schuylkill River
Watershed for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, and one-hundred-year design
storms are shown below. Development sites located in each of the A, B, or C
Districts must control postdevelopment runoff rates to predevelopment runoff rates
for the design storms as follows:

NOTES:
* The minimum performance standard for development sites in District C is
that stormwater management controls must be provided to limit the
postdevelopment peak rate of stormwater runoff to a rate that is equal to or
less than the existing peak rate of stormwater runoff. This minimum
performance criteria was set through a policy directive of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection. However, in the previous
development of the Act 167 Plan, this district was originally established as a
conditional no-detention district such that development sites which could
discharge directly to the main channel of the Schuylkill River and its major
tributaries, or indirectly to the main channel through an existing stormwater
drainage system (i.e., storm sewer or open channel) could do so without
control of the postdevelopment peak rate of runoff.
325:I4 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-9 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 325-9
§ 325-9. Stormwater management district implementation provisions (performance
standards).
A. General. Postdevelopment rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall meet the peak
release rates of runoff prior to development for the design storms specified on the
Stormwater Management District Watershed Map (Appendix D)4.
B. District boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on
an official map that is available for inspections at the Borough office. A copy of the
official map at a reduced scale is included in Appendix D. The exact location of the
stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site
shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours
(or most accurate data required) provided as part of the drainage plan.
C. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site located within
two or more stormwater management district category subareas, the peak discharge rate
from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea as
indicated in § 325-8 of this chapter. The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless
of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea. An exception to the
above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the
site. In this case, peak discharge in any direction may be a one-hundred-percent release
rate, provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
D. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates. However,
on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the
development site.
E. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs
significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater
management measures shall be subject to the management district criteria. In other
words, unimpacted areas bypassing the stormwater management facilities would not be
subject to the management district criteria.
F. No-harm option. For any proposed development site not located in a provisional direct
discharge district, the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control
(including no detention) if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by
discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan. The no-harm option is
used when a developer can prove that the postdevelopment hydrographs can match
predevelopment hydrographs, or if it can be proved that the postdevelopment conditions
will not cause increases in peaks at all points downstream. Proof of no harm would have
to be shown based upon the following downstream impact evaluation which shall include
a downstream hydraulic capacity analysis consistent with § 325-9G to determine if
adequate hydraulic capacity exists. The land developer shall submit to the Borough this
evaluation of the impacts due to increased downstream stormwater flows in the
watershed.
4. Editor's Note: Said appendix is on file in the Borough offices.
325:15 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-9 BIRDSBORO CODE § 325-9
(1) The downstream impact evaluation shall include hydrologic and hydraulic
calculations necessary to determine the impact of hydrograph timing modifications
due to the proposed development upon a dam, highway, structure, natural point of
restricted streamflow or any stream channel section, established with the
concurrence of the Borough.
(2) The evaluation shall continue downstream until the increase in flow diminishes due
to additional flow from tributaries and/or stream attenuation.
(3) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period
storms (two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year) shall be the
values from the calibrated model for the Schuylkill River Watershed. These flow
values can be obtained from the watershed plan.
(4) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow
rates at storm drainage problem areas would, by definition, be precluded from
successful attempts to prove no harm, except in conjunction with proposed
capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with§ 325-9G.
(5) A financial distress shall not constitute grounds for granting a no-harm exemption.
(6) Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to implement the no-harm
option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less
stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream.
(7) Any no-harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the
drainage plan submission per§§ 325-22 through 325-28.
G. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream capacity hydraulic analysis
conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use the following criteria for determining
adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the increased
runoff associated with a two-year return period event within their banks at
velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable
velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey increased
twenty-five-year return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or
property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey
flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with DEP Chapter
105 regulations (if applicable) and, at mirumurn, pass the increased
twenty-five-year return period runoff.
H. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas, it may be more cost effective to
provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an
individual control facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers. The
325:16 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-9 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 325-10
I.
design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the
entire upstream watershed for which it serves. The peak outflow of a regional basin
would be determined on a case-by-case basis using the hydrologic model of the
watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic
model" refers to the calibrated model as developed for the stormwater management plan.
Hardship option. The development of the plan and its standards and criteria was designed
to maintain existing peak flows throughout the Schuylkill River Watershed as the
watershed becomes developed. There may be certain instances, however, where the
standards and criteria established are too restrictive for a particular landowner or
developer. The existing drainage network in some areas may be capable of safely
transporting slight increases in flows without causing a problem or increasing flows
elsewhere. If a developer or homeowner may not be able to possibly meet the stormwater
standards due to lot conditions or if conformance would become a hardship to an owner,
the hardship option may be applied. The landowner would have to plead his/her case to
the Borough Council with the final determination made by the Borough. Any landowners
pleading the hardship option will assume all liabilities that may arise due to exercising
this option.
§ 325-10. Design criteria for stormwater management facilities.
A. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to
approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) .
B. Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin) designed to store runoff and
requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or regulated by this chapter shall be
designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to and including the
one-hundred-year postdevelopment conditions. The height of embankment must be set as
to provide a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard above the maximum pool elevation
computed when the facility functions for the one-hundred-year postdevelopment inflow.
Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety permit under P ADEP
Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the
regulations of Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may be required to pass storms
larger than one-hundred-year event. The applicant shall provide evidence of P ADEP
approval prior to final plan approval.
C. Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream
enclosures), and any work involving wetlands as directed in PADEP Chapter 105
regulations (as amended or replaced from time to time by PADEP), shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and will require a permit from PADEP. Any other drainage
conveyance facility that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations must be able to
convey, without damage to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the
twenty-five-year design storm with a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway. Any facility located within a PennDOT
right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum design standards and permit submission
requirements.
325:17 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-10 BIRDSBORO CODE § 325-11
D. Any drainage conveyance facility and/or channel that does not fall under Chapter 105
regulations, must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway, runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm. Conveyance facilities to or
exiting from stormwater management facilities (i.e., detention basins) shall be designed
to convey the design flow to or from that structure. Roadway crossings located within
designated floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff from a one-hundred-year
design storm. Any facility located within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT
minimum design standards and permit submission requirements.
E. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels and at all points of
discharge.
F. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate sound engineering
principles and practices. The Borough shall reserve the right to disapprove any design
that would result in the ·occupancy or continuation of an adverse hydrologic or hydraulic
condition within the watershed.
§ 325-11. Calculation methodology.
Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using either the Rational
Method or a soil-cover-complex methodology.
A. Any stormwater runoff calculations shall use any generally accepted calculation
technique that is based on the NRCS soil-cover complex method. Table
325-11-1 5 summarizes acceptable computation methods. It is assumed that all methods
will be selected by the design professional based on the individual limitations and
suitability of each method for a particular site. The Borough may allow the use of the
Rational Method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain less than
50 acres. The Rational Method is recommended for drainage areas under 20 acres. The
method utilized shall be subject to the Borough Engineer's approval.
B. All calculations consistent with this section using the soil-cover complex method shall
use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms according
to the region for which they are located as presented in Table Bl in Appendix B.6 If a
hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1 is used for stormwater runoff
calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours. The SCS S-curve shown in
Figure B-1, Appendix B, shall be used for the rainfall distribution.
C. For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination, undeveloped land shall be
considered as meadow in good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a
lower curve number or rational C value (i.e., forest), as listed in Table B-2 or B-3 in
Appendix B.
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities consistent with
appropriate times-of-concentration for overland flow and return periods from the design
storm curves from PA Department of Transportation Design Rainfall Curves (1986)

Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used for hydraulic
computations and to determine the capacity of open channels, pipes, and storm sewers.
Values for Manning's roughness coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table B-4 in
Appendix B. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be designed to
meet the performance standards of this chapter using any generally accepted hydraulic
analysis technique or method and computer model. The applicant shall make available
any support documentation for computer models as requested by the Borough Engineer.
The Borough Engineer shall determine what computer models are acceptable.
H. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the performance
standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through these facilities using the storage-indication method. For drainage areas greater
than 200 acres in size, the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a
calculation method that produces a full hydrograph. The Borough may approve the use of
any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total
runoff volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces a full
hydrograph.

§ 325-12. Erosion and sedimentation requirements.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall commence until the
Borough receives an approval from the Conservation District of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities.
B. DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan for any earth
disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more, under 25 Pa. Code§ 102.4(b).
C. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES construction activities permit
is required for regulated earth disturbance activities.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance activities from the
appropriate DEP regional office or County Conservation District must be provided to the
Borough. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit (or permit coverage under the
statewide General Permit (PAG-2) satisfies the requirements§ 325-12A.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required permit, as required by
DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all times.
F. Additional erosion and sediment control design standards and criteria are recommended
to be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed shall include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from sedimentation and
compaction during the construction phase to maintain maximum infiltration
capacity.
325:20 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-12 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 325-13
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until the entire
contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has received final stabilization.
§ 325-13. Nonstructural project design (sequencing to minimize stormwater impacts).
A. For projects disturbing one acre or more, the design of all regulated activities shall
include evaluation of practicable alternatives to the surface discharge of stormwater, the
creation of impervious surfaces, and the degradation of waters of the commonwealth, and
must maintain as much as possible the natural hydrologic regime of the site.
(1) An alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of being done after taking
into consideration existing technology and logistics in light of overall project
purposes and other Borough requirements.
(2) All practicable alternatives to the discharge of stormwater are presumed to have
less adverse impact on quantity and quality of waters of the commonwealth unless
otherwise demonstrated.
B. The applicant shall demonstrate that they designed the regulated activities that disturb
one acre or more included consideration of the following issues:
(1) Prepare an existing resource and site analysis map (ERSAM), showing
environmentally sensitive areas, including, but not limited to, steep slopes, ponds,
lakes, streams, wetlands, hydric soils, vernal pools, floodplains, stream buffer
zones, hydrologic soil groups A and B (areas conducive to infiltration), special
geologic features, any existing recharge areas and any other requirements outlined
in Chapter 335, Subdivision and Land Development, of the Code of the Borough
of Birdsboro.
(2) Establish appropriate buffers for each of the delineated environmentally sensitive
areas. (See § 395-83 of Chapter 395, Zoning, of Code of the Borough of Birdsboro
for stream buffers and § 325-2 lJ for special geologic feature buffers).
(3) Prepare a draft project layout avoiding sensitive areas identified in§ 325-15B(l).
(4) Identify site specific existing conditions drainage areas, discharge points, recharge
areas and hydrologic soil groups A and B.
(5) Evaluate nonstructural stormwater management alternatives:
(a) Minimize earth disturbance.
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces.
(c) Break up large impervious surfaces.
(6) Satisfy infiltration objective (§ 325-14) and provide for stormwater pretreatment
prior to infiltration. Pretreatment may not be necessary for rooftop runoff which
enters the infiltration facility directly from a roof leader.
325:21 07-01-2011
§ 325-13 BIRDSBORO CODE § 325-14
(7) Satisfy water quality (§ 325-15) and streambank erosion protection objective
(§ 325-16).
(8) Determine what management district the site falls into (Appendix D) and conduct
an existing conditions runoff analysis.
(9) Prepare final project design to maintain existing conditions drainage areas and
discharge points, to minimize earth disturbance and impervious surfaces, and to the
maximum extent possible, to ensure the remaining site development has no surface
or point discharge.
(10) Conduct a proposed conditions runoff analysis based on the final design and to
meet the release rate and in turn the overbank flow and extreme event
requirements (§ 325-8).
(11) Manage any remaining runoff through treatment prior to discharge, as part of
detention, bioretention, direct discharge or other structural control.
§ 325-14. Groundwater recharge (infiltration; recharge; bioretention).
Maximizing the groundwater recharge capacity of the area being developed is required.
Design of the infiltration stormwater management facilities shall give consideration to
providing groundwater recharge to compensate for the reduction in the percolation that occurs
when the ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is created. It is recommended that
roof runoff be directed to infiltration BMPs which can be over designed to compensate for the
infiltration losses due to parking areas. It is recommended that roof runoff be directed to
infiltration BMPs which may be designed to compensate for the runoff from parking areas.
These measures are required to be consistent with § 325-2, and take advantage of utilizing any
existing recharge areas. Infiltration may not be feasible on every site due to site-specific
limitations such as soil type. If it cannot be physically accomplished, due to seasonal high
water table, soil permeability rate, soil depth or setback distances from special geologic
features, then the design professional shall be responsible to show that this cannot be
physically accomplished. If it can be physically accomplished, then the volume of runoff to be
infiltrated shall be determined from § 325-14A(3) depending on demonstrated site conditions
and shall be the greater of the two volumes.
A. Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(1) Infiltration requirements. Regulated activities will be required to infiltrate, where
site conditions permit, a portion of the runoff created by the development as part of
an overall stormwater management plan designed for the site. The volume of
runoff to be infiltrated shall be determined from§ 325-14A(3)(a) or (b), depending
upon demonstrated site conditions.
(2) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall be selected
based on suitability of soils and site conditions and shall be constructed on soils
that have the following characteristics:
(a) A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP and the
limiting zone.
325:22 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-14 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 325-14
(b) An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater load and drain completely as determined by field tests conducted
by the applicant's design professional.
(c) The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely infiltrating the required
retention (infiltration) volume within four days (96 hours).
( d) Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.
(3) The size of the infiltration facility shall be based upon the following volume
criteria:
(a) NRCS curve number equation.
The NRCS runoff equation shall be utilized to calculate infiltration
requirements (I) in inches.
I (Infiltration requirement, in inches) =
(200/CN)-2
Where:
Eqn: 325-14-1
CN = SCS (NRCS) curve number of existing conditions
contributing to the infiltration facility.
This equation is displayed graphically in, and the infiltration
requirement can be determined from Figure 325-14-1.
It has been determined that infiltrating 0.46 inches of runoff from the
impervious areas will aid in maintaining the hydrologic regime of the
watershed. However, the rounded number 0.5 inches shall be used.

(b) Annual recharge, water budget approach.
[1] If the goals of § 325-A(3)(a) cannot be achieved, then 0.5 inch of
rainfall shall be infiltrated from all impervious areas, up to an existing
site conditions curve number of 81. Above a curve number of 81,
Equation 325-14-1 or the curve in Figure 325-14-1 should be used to
determine the infiltration requirement.

[2] The retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) required again would therefore
be computed as:
Rev = (0.5 or I, whichever is greater)* Impervious area (square
feet)/(12 in/ft)= cubic feet.
B. Soils. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required where practicable to
determine the suitability of infiltration facilities. The evaluation shall be performed by a
qualified design professional, and at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to
bedrock and subgrade stability. The general process for designing the infiltration BMP
shall be:
(1) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made features within
the site to determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices. In areas
where development on fill material is under consideration, conduct geotechnical
investigations of subgrade stability; infiltration is not permitted to be ruled out
without conducting these tests.
(2) Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or hydraulic conductivity tests
(at the level of the proposed infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate
hydraulic conductivity rate. Percolation tests are not recommended for design
purposes.
(3) Design the infiltration structure for the required retention (Rev) volume based on
field determined capacity at the level of the proposed infiltration surface.
(4) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant's design professional,
it must be demonstrated to the Borough that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on
the lots identified.
C. Carbonate areas. The applicant is required to investigate the ability of all areas on the site
which are not underlain by carbonate rock to meet the infiltration requirements of
§ 325-14A. If this investigation proves infeasible, infiltration can occur on areas
underlain by carbonate rock by following the recommended procedure below in
conjunction with Figure B-3 in Appendix B.8 However, the applicant is not required to
use infiltration in carbonate areas even if the site falls into the "Recommended" range on
Figure B-3 in Appendix B. If infiltration is not proposed, the calculated infiltration
volume(§ 325-14A) shall be treated by an acceptable BMP.
(1) Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in Figure B-3 in Appendix B shall be
calculated as follows:

§ 325-14 BIRDSBORO CODE § 325-14
(2) The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as follows:
Area Description
All disturbed· area to be made impervious
All disturbed areas to be made pervious
All undisturbed impervious areas
All undisturbed pervious areas
Weighting
100%

(3) Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed infiltration
BMP. The effective soil thickness in Figure B-3 in Appendix B is the measured
soil thickness multiplied by the thickness factor based on soil permeability, as
follows:
Permeability Range
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour
0.75 to 1.0 inch/hour

(4) The design of all facilities over Karst shall include an evaluation of measures to
minimize adverse effects.
D. Stormwater hotspots.
(1) Following is a list of examples of designated hotspots. If a site is designated as a
hotspot, it has important implications for how stormwater is managed. First and
foremost, untreated stormwater runoff from hotspots shall not be allowed to
recharge into groundwater where it may contaminate water supplies. Therefore, the
Re. requirement shall not be applied to development sites that fit into the hotspot
category (the entire WQ.., must still be treated). Second, a greater level of
stormwater treatment shall be considered at hotspot sites to prevent pollutant
washoff after construction. EPA's NPDES stormwater program requires some
industrial sites to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan.
(2) Examples of hotspots:
(a) Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities.
(b) Vehicle fueling stations.
(c) Vehicle service and maintenance facilities.
(d) Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities.
(e) Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.).
325:26 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-14 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
(t) Industrial sites (based on Standard Industrial Codes).
(g) Marinas (service and maintenance).
(h) Outdoor liquid container storage.
(i) Outdoor loading/unloading facilities.
U) Public works storage areas.
(k) Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials.
(1) Commercial container nursery.
§ 325-14
(m) Other land uses and activities as designated by an appropriate review
authority.
(3) The following land uses and activities are not normally considered hotspots:
(4)
(a) Residential streets and rural highways.
(b) Residential development.
( c) Institutional development.
( d) Office developments.
( e) Nonindustrial rooftops .
(t) Pervious areas, except golf courses and nursenes (which may need an
integrated pest management (IPM) plan).
While large highways (average daily traffic volume (ADT) greater than 30,000) are
not designated as a stormwater hotspot, it is important to ensure that highway
stormwater management plans adequately protect groundwater.
E. Caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in source water protection areas
as defined by the local Borough or water authority.
F. Infiltration facilities shall be used in conjunction with other innovative or traditional
stormwater control facilities that are found within the PADEP State BMP Manual.
G. Caution shall be exercised where salt or chloride (Borough salt storage) would be a
pollutant since soils do little to filter this pollutant and it may contaminate the
groundwater. The qualified design professional shall evaluate the possibility of
groundwater contamination from the proposed infiltration facility and perform a
hydrogeologic justification study if necessary.
H. The infiltration requirement in high quality or exceptional value waters shall be subject
to the Department's Chapter 93 antidegradation regulations.
I. Dependent upon certain land use or hotspots, an impermeable liner will be required in
detention basins where the possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A detailed
hydrogeologic investigation may be required by the Borough.
325:27 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-14 BIRDSBORO CODE § 325-15
J. The Borough shall require the applicant to provide safeguards against groundwater
contamination for land uses that may cause groundwater contamination should there be a
mishap or spill.
K. For projects that disturb one acre or more, unless otherwise specified in Chapter 395,
Zoning, the following setbacks for infiltration facilities shall apply:
(1) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(2) Ten feet downslope or 100 feet upslope from building foundations.
(3) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields.
(4) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock, unless a preliminary site
investigation is done in the carbonate bedrock to show the absence of special
geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(5) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation is provided to show
all setbacks from wells, foundations and drainfields on the neighboring property
will be met.
§ 325-15. Water quality requirements.
A. Developed areas shall provide adequate storage and treatment facilities necessary to
capture and treat stormwater runoff. The infiltration volume computed under § 325-14
may be a component of the water quality volume if the applicant chooses to manage both
components in a single facility. If the infiltration volume is less than the water quality
volume, the remaining water quality volume may be captured and treated by methods
other than infiltration BMPs. The required water quality volume (WQv) is the storage
capacity needed to capture and treat a portion of stormwater runoff from the developed
areas of the site. To achieve this goal, the following criterion is established:
(1) The following calculation formula is to be used to determine the water quality
storage volume, (WQv), in acre-feet of storage for the Schuylkill River Watershed:
WQv=[(P)(Rv)(A)]/12 Eqn: 325-15-1
Where:
WQv Water quality volume (acre-feet)
P 1 inch
A Total contributing drainage area to the water quality BMP (acres)
Rv 0.05 + 0.009(1) where I is the percent of the area that is impervious
surface ((impervious area/A)*lOO)
(2) This volume requirement can be accomplished by the permanent volume of a wet
basin or the detained volume from other BMPs.
325:28 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-15 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 325-15
(3) Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water
quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The design of the facility shall
provide for protection from clogging and unwanted sedimentation.
B. For areas within defined special protection subwatersheds, which include exceptional
value (EV) and high quality (HQ) waters, cold water fishery (CWF), the temperature and
quality of water and streams shall be maintained.
C. To accomplish the above, the applicant shall use innovative or traditional stormwater
control facilities that are found within the P ADEP State BMP Manual.
D. Designs may achieve the water quality objectives through a combination of BMPs (best
management practices). All design of BMPs used for water quality control shall be in
accordance with design specifications outlined m the Maryland Stormwater Design
Manual, Maryland Department of the Environment,
(http://www.mde.state.md.us/Programs/Water
Programs/SedimentandStormwater/home/index.asp), latest edition, or other design
manuals approved by the Borough.
E. In selecting the appropriate BMPs or combinations thereof, the land developer shall
consider the following:
(1) Total contributing area.
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils .
(3) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(4) Seasonal high-water table.
(5) Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
( 6) Erodibility of soils.
(7) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
F. The following additional factors should be considered when evaluating the suitability of
BMPs used to control water quality at a given development site:
(1) Peak discharge and required volume control.
(2) Streambank erosion.
(3) Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality problems.
(4) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
(5) The nature of the pollutant being removed.
(6) Maintenance requirements.
(7) Creation/protection of aquatic and wildlife habitat.
(8) Recreational value.
325:29 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-15 BIRDSBORO CODE § 325-17
(9) Enhancement of aesthetic and property value.
G. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance activities from the
appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to the Borough. The issuance of an
NPDES construction permit (or permit coverage under the statewide General Permit
(PAG-2) satisfies the requirements of§ 325-15A.
H. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the site, the applicant shall create a
stream buffer extending a minimum of 50 feet to either side of the top-of-bank of the
channel. The buffer area shall be maintained with appropriate native vegetation
(Reference to Appendix H of Pennsylvania Handbook of Best Management Practices for
Developing Area for plant lists). If the applicable rear or side yard setback is less than 50
feet, the buffer width may be reduced to 25% of the setback to a minimum of 10 feet. If
an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant, easement, etc.) and it
exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the existing buffer shall be maintained. (The
Borough may select a smaller or larger buffer width if desired, but the selected buffer
may not be less than 10 feet). This does not include lakes or wetlands.
§ 325-16. Streambank erosion requirements.
A. In addition to control of the water quality volume, in order to minimize the impact of
stormwater runoff on downstream streambank erosion, the primary requirement is to
design a BMP to detain the proposed conditions two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm
to the existing conditions one-year peak flow using the SCS Type II distribution.
Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at the bottom of
the outlet structure) so that the proposed conditions one-year storm takes a minimum of
24 hours to drain from the facility from a point where the maximum volume of water
from the one-year storm is captured. (i.e., the maximum water surface elevation is
achieved in. the facility). Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the
invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility).
B. The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be a three-inch
diameter orifice and a trash rack shall be installed to prevent clogging. On sites with
small contributing drainage areas to this BMP that do not provide enough runoff volume
to allow a twenty-four-hour attenuation with the three-inch orifice, the calculations shall
be submitted showing this condition. Orifice sizes less than three inches can be utilized,
provided that the design will prevent clogging of the intake.
§ 325-17. Floodplain methodology.
A. All existing and proposed one-hundred-year floodplains shall be delineated on the
comprehensive stormwater management plan (see §§ 325-22 through 325-28). If the
one-hundred-year floodplain is not mapped by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency as part of the National Flood Insurance Program, the horizontal and vertical
limits of the floodplain shall be determined utilizing the standard step method (i.e.,
HEC-RAS or similar approved computer model). If the HEC-RAS model is used, the
applicant shall submit a computer disc containing all input files for the calculations, in
325:30 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-17 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 325-18
B.
order to expedite the floodplain review. If the drainage area is less than 100 acres, the
Mannings equation may be used.
The methods below shall be used to compute the design flow(s) in the drainage course
although other methods may be used with approval of the Borough. A conservative
average of two methods shall be used, and the design flow is subject to approval by the
Borough.
(1) The graphical and tabular methods in TR-55. The graphical method may be used
for streams whose drainage area at the point of interest is no larger than 2,000
acres, and the tabular hydrograph method may be used for drainage areas up to 20
square miles (12,800 acres).
(2) The rational method may be used for streams whose drainage area at the point of
interest is no larger than 320 acres.
(3) The method in Water Resources Bulletin Number 13, Floods in Pennsylvania,
issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now

§ 325-18. Additional design criteria for selected best management practices.
A. Infiltration devices shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site conditions.
Suitability of soils shall be determined by soil infiltration testing, with suitability
typically defined as having minimum percolation rates of 0.5 inch per hour at the
elevation of the bottom of the facility (lower rates can be acceptable in special
situations).
B. Soil infiltration testing shall be performed for all proposed infiltration areas; soil testing
shall include evaluation of appropriate soil horizons with deep pits and percolation
measurements, making sure to assess percolation rates at the proposed infiltration device
bed bottom. Soil testing, including the frequency and locations of the tests, should be
reviewed and approved by the Borough. The design soil infiltration rate shall be the
average infiltration rate measured at each proposed area.
C. The lowest elevation of the infiltration area shall be at least two feet above the seasonal
high-water table (SHWT) and bedrock, except in the case of limestone formations, m
which case the distance shall be four feet.
D. All roof drains which discharge to infiltration systems shall have appropriate measures to
prevent clogging by vegetation and prevent sinkhole formation.
E. All infiltration systems shall have appropriate positive overflow controls within one foot
of the finished surface or grade.
325:31 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-18 BIRDSBORO CODE § 325-19
F. All infiltration systems shall have a setback of 15 feet from all residential structures and
property lines. Seepage into subgrade structures shall be prevented.
G. All infiltration systems shall be designed to infiltrate the stored volume within 48 hours.
H. All surface inflows shall be designed to minimize the discharge of sediment into the
infiltration system in order to prevent sediment accumulation, which reduces stormwater
storage capacity and ultimately clogs the infiltration mechanism.
I. Special provisions are required when using infiltration BMPs in carbonate areas in order
to avoid groundwater contamination and solution channel/sinkhole formation. In these
cases, the Borough may require that a detailed geologic evaluation of the project site be
performed to determine the suitability for recharge, including both the potential for
groundwater contamination and potential for sinkhole formation. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified geologist and/or soil scientist, and, at a minimum, address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and subgrade
stability.
(1) Because potential for these problems to develop increases as soil thickness
decreases, the soil mantle should be determined to be a minimum of four feet in
thickness, in order to both remove pollutants and uniformly disperse groundwater
movement, which is important to avoid solution channel formation.
(2) In carbonate areas, BMPs which disperse stormwater over the largest feasible area
should be used (e.g., subtle berms and level spreaders) so as not to significantly
modify the natural hydrologic regime. Use of infiltration BMPs which result in
significant increases (more than a one-hundred-percent increase) in the
predevelopment rate of infiltration per unit area should be avoided in carbonate
areas, unless a detailed geologic evaluation (see below) demonstrates that the
potential for sinkhole formation is minimal.
(3) Stormwater runoff from significant pollutant producing sources (so called hotspots
such as industrial uses, gas stations, fast food and other commercial uses
generating large numbers of vehicle trips, and other uses at the determination of
the Borough) shall be filtered and/or pretreated using a water quality BMP before
being discharged in carbonate areas.
§ 325-19. Use of basins, storm sewers, culverts, bridges and other structural
installations.
Basins, storm sewers, culverts, bridges and other structural installations shall be provided to
safely accommodate stormwater, where natural nonstructural practices are not feasible and
where stormwater flows otherwise would have adverse impact on the environment and the
general welfare of the Borough of Birdsboro and its citizens in order to:
A. Maintain natural hydrologic regimes of streams and watercourses. Such flows may be
redirected as required, subject to the approval of PADEP.
325:32 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-19 STORMW ATER MANAGEMENT § 325-20
B. Promote drainage of all low points along the line of streets. Overflow swales shall be
designed to convey the full one-hundred-year storm flows away from all street low
points. These swales shall be located to prevent flooding of the downslope lots.
C. Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals reasonably related to the extent and
grade of the area drained, and to prevent substantial flow of water across intersections or
flooding of intersections during the design storm stipulated elsewhere in this chapter.
D. Insure adequate and unimpeded flow of stormwater under driveways in, near, or across
natural watercourses or drainage swales. Suitable pipes or other waterway openings shall
be provided as necessary.
§ 325-20. Design of basins (detention and retention), storm sewers, culverts, bridges and
other structural installations.
A. Standards for conventional basins shall meet requirements listed in this section.
(1) Basins shall be installed prior to any earthmoving or land disturbances that they
will serve. The phasing of their construction shall be noted in the erosion and
sedimentation control narrative and on the E&S plan. Permanent vegetation shall
be established prior to denuding any other land, unless the basin functions as an
E&S device.
(2) Basins shall be designed to provide for groundwater recharge wherever feasible.
For basins located in the carbonate area, a detailed geologic evaluation of the
project site shall be performed to determine the suitability for recharge, including
both the potential for groundwater contamination and potential for sinkhole
formation. The evaluation shall be performed by a qualified geologist and/or soil
scientist, and, at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to bedrock,
susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and subgrade stability. Soils used for the
construction of basins shall have low-erodibility factors (K factors). The Borough
may require an impermeable liner to be installed up to the one-hundred-year design
water surface elevation.
(3) Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at points where pipes or
drainageways discharge from basins. Multiple outlet structures and multiple outlet
piping from the basin may be required by the Borough to reduce the impact of
point discharges.
(4) The following slope restrictions shall apply to basins:
(a) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed one foot vertical for three
feet horizontal, and may be further reduced if the soil has unstable
characteristics.
(b) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed one foot vertical in three feet
horizontal except with approval of the Borough and:
325:33 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-20 BIRDSBORO CODE § 325-20
[ 1] Where maximum water depth will not exceed three feet; or
[2] When a two-inch rainfall in one hour will not exceed the capacity of the
basin in one hour; or
[3] Where concrete, stone or brick walls are used with side slopes proposed
to be steeper than one foot vertical in three feet horizontal, in which
case the basin shall be fenced by a permanent fence 42 inches in height
and a ramp of durable, nonslip materials for maintenance vehicles shall
be provided for access into the basin.
(c) The minimum bottom slope shall be 3% for grass, and 0.75% for concrete
paving. One percent may be used for grass if an underdrain system is
provided. A concrete low flow channel may be required for basins where the
distance from the inlet pipe to the outlet structure exceeds 100 feet,
depending upon site conditions. The minimum channel width shall be four
feet. The channel shall be constructed of four-inch thick concrete (3,300 psi
twenty-eight-day strength) over four inches of PennDOT No. 2A stone.
(5) Basins shall also be designed to meet the following requirements:
(a) The minimum top of berm width shall be eight feet, unless waived by the
Borough.
(b) Outlet pipes shall have a minimum diameter of 12 inches. For pipe lengths
exceeding 100 feet, the minimum diameter shall be 15 inches.
( c) Properly spaced anti seep collars shall be installed on all basin outlet pipes.
Design calculations shall be provided.
( d) All basins shall be constructed with a compacted relatively impervious
(Unified Soil Classification CL-ML or CL) key trench and core. The key
trench shall extend at least two feet into undisturbed subsoil (below topsoil
layer). The minimum bottom width of the trench shall be six feet and the
minimum top width of the core shall be four feet. The side slopes of the
compacted core and trench shall not exceed one horizontal to one vertical,
and the top elevation of the core shall be set at or above the twenty-five-year
design water elevation.
(6) Basin outlet structures and emergency spillways.
(a) Outlet structures within basins which will control peak discharge flows and
distribute the flows by pipes to discharge areas shall be constructed primarily
of concrete or masonry material and shall have childproof, nonclogging trash
racks over all design openings, except those openings designed to carry
perennial stream flows. Trash rack material should be epoxy-coated
galvanized or stainless steel. Other materials are subject to the approval of
the Borough.
(b) Six inches of freeboard shall be provided between the crest of the primary
outlet structure and the invert of the emergency spillway.
325:34 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 325-20 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 325-20
(c) Emergency spillways shall be constructed in undisturbed earth wherever
possible. When constructed in fill, sod, precast concrete paving blocks,
concrete or permanent erosion-control matting shall be used. Design
calculations shall be submitted indicating that the specified material can
withstand velocities based on the one-hundred-year design storm event. When
using sod, it shall be applied along the inside slope above the
twenty-five-year water surface elevation, along the face and sides of the
spillway and down the outside slope to existing grade. Emergency spillways
shall be designed to safely convey the one-hundred-year basin inflow
hydrograph through the basin assuming the principal outlet is completely
blocked and the basin water surface elevation is equal to the spillway invert
elevation.
(7) Basin inlet and outlet structures should be located at maximum distances from one
another. The Borough may require a rock filter berm or rockfilled gabions between
inlet and outlet areas when the distance is deemed insufficient for sediment
trappings.
(8) Permanent grasses or stabilization measures shall be established on the sides of all
earthen basins by hydroseeding within five days of initial construction (or
conversion from sediment basin or sediment trap). The Borough may require jute
or erosion-control matting to be installed inside the basin or on the basin
embankment.
(9) Stormwater runoff shall discharge to a suitable natural drainage course (except
where prohibited by riparian buffer area regulations of this Code) or storm sewer
system. Where not possible or not permitted, level spreading devices or other
suitable facilities (i.e., swale) shall be designed with sufficient capacity to convey
the one-hundred-year storm event without creating any safety flooding, or property
hazard. Securing of necessary drainage easements for this purpose shall be the sole
responsibility of the developer.
(10) The Borough may require soil samples from the site to be analyzed to determine if
these soils are suitable for berm embankment construction. If the soils are found to
be unsuitable, the developer shall import suitable soils for constructing the basin.
B. Swale design.
(1) Grass swales not specifically designed as BMP devices shall have a minimum
bottom slope of 2%. Swales lining shall be designed based on the ten-year
velocity. Swales shall have sufficient and freeboard to convey the
one-hundred-year storm discharge without creating any safety or property hazard.
(2) Swales, when located outside of the Borough right-of-way, shall be located within
an easement not less than 20 feet wide, but of sufficient width to allow access for
maintenance and to convey the one-hundred-year storm. A note on the plan shall
indicate that the easement allows the Borough the right, though not the
responsibility, to perform needed maintenance and/or repairs.

Publication 408 Design Manual, Part 2 Highway Design and Standards for
Roadway Construction, RC-Series unless otherwise dictated by the Borough Code.
(7) Any changes in alignment shall be straight sections connected by inlets or
manholes.
(8) When there is a change in pipe size through an inlet, the top inside elevation of the
outlet pipe shall be at or below the top inside elevations of all incoming pipes.
(9) Storm sewer sizes shall be determined based upon the following design storm
frequencies:
(a) Storm sewers shall be designed to be able to convey postdevelopment runoff
from a twenty-five-year design storm without surcharging inlets.
(b) Gutter capacity shall be analyzed. Inlets shall be spaced such that gutter
spread does not exceed 1/2 the lane width (one-fourth the road width).
(c) Inlets shall be evaluated for inlet efficiency. Inlet efficiencies shall be based
on PennDOT Publication 13, Design Manual Part 2, Chapter 10. Other
methods may be utilized but shall be subject to the Borough Engineer's
approval.

replacement of more than 25% of the total area of said concrete block, then said concrete
block in need of repair shall be replaced in its entirety; provided, however, where a
portion of such a concrete block is removed for installation or repairs to utilities, then
said block shall be replaced in its entirety.
I. Curb and sidewalk shall be constructed along the front of each Jot within the Borough on

perform or cause to be performed any and all necessary work then required to correct any defect which
has arisen in or to correct the restoration work previously performed. The Code Enforcement Officer

fail to perform such required corrective work within five days of receipt of written notification from the
manager, the Borough, at its discretion, may complete such work and shall invoice the permittee for the
actual total expense incurred by the Borough to perform the work including expense incurred for labor,
equipment, materials plus 10 percent of the amount of such total expense. Upon the permittee's failure

§ 381-12. Water rates, rents and charges.
A. Water rates, rents and charges are hereby fixed, adopted, established and imposed upon
each property owner-consumer within the Borough.
B. Metered rates.
(1) Meter charges. Each property owner-consumer shall pay a quarterly meter charge
based upon the user classification and the size of the meter. The meter charge shall
be computed in accordance with the Borough's current metered rate schedule
which shall be established by separate resolution.
(2) Minimum charges. Each property owner-consumer shall pay a minimum quarterly
charge based upon the classification. Included with the minimum charge is an
allowable maximum quarterly water consumption. The minimum charge shall be
computed in accordance with the Borough's current metered rate schedule which
shall be established by separate resolution.
(3) Consumption charges. In addition to the minimum charge and the meter charge,
each property owner-consumer shall pay a consumption charge based on the excess
consumption per meter over that included in the minimum charge. The
consumption charge shall be computed in accordance with the Borough's current
metered rate schedule which shall be established by separate resolution.
(4) Additional classifications and water rates, rents and charges therefor or
modifications of the current schedule of sewer rentals or charges may be
established by the Borough, from time to time, as deemed necessary.
(5) Multiple meters. If any property owner-consumer has more than one meter
supplying one property and desires to consolidate all meter readings, multiple
minimum water rates, rents and charges shall be imposed upon such property
owner-consumer equal to the minimum charge for each classification of user times
the number of such meters. Such minimum water rates, rents and charges shall
include an amount of aggregate water consumption equal to the minimum charge
per quarter times the number of such meters.
(6) Multiple consumer units. Where more than one consumer unit is located in one
building, house or other structure owned by one property owner-consumer and
such building, house or other structure, at the discretion of the Borough, is served
by one meter, multiple charges per quarter shall be imposed upon such property
owner-consumer equal to the number of consumer units located in such building,
house or other structure. The multiple quarterly charges shall be computed in the
following manner:
(a) The total consumption of water through such common water meter shall be
divided by the number of consumer units served thereby;
381:7 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 381-12 BIRDSBORO CODE § 381-13
(b) The schedule of meter rates for computing water rates, rents and charges as
established hereunder shall be applied to the resultant quotient; and
(c) The resultant pro rata rental and charge for each consumer unit shall be
multiplied by the number of such consumer units receiving water service
through such common water meter to arrive at a total bill for all such
consumer units served through the common meter; provided, however, that
there shall be charged the minimum quarterly rental and charge for each
consumer unit on the same basis as if each consumer unit were served by a
separate water meter of the same size as the common water meter.
C. Private and public fire-protection service.
(1) Private fire-protection service.
(a) Each property owner-consumer shall pay a fire-protection charge based upon
the number of fire hydrants provided or the size of the fire-protection service
installed. The fire-protection charge shall be computed in accordance with the
Borough's current private and public fire-protection rate schedule which shall
be established by separate resolution.
(b) For all measured water passing the meter on a private fire-protection service
connection, except water used to extinguish fire or to test fire-protection
equipment, the charge shall be at consumption charge rates not subject to
minimum charges and equal to those in Schedule B.
(2) Public fire-protection service. Each public consumer shall pay a fire-protection
charge based upon the number of fire hydrants provided. The fire-protection charge
shall be computed in accordance with the Borough's current private and public
fire-protection rate schedule which shall be established by separate resolution.
§ 381-13. Billing and payment.
A. Bill for water service shall be rendered quarterly and shall represent the amount due for
water service rendered during the preceding three months.
B. All bills for water service shall be due and payable as of the date thereof.
C. If quarterly bills shall not be paid within 30 days after such shall become due and
payable, a penalty of 10% shall be added. Payments mailed and postmarked on or before
such 30th day shall be deemed to be payments within the period allowed for payment
without penalty. If such 30th day shall be a legal holiday or a Sunday, payments made on
or mailed and postmarked on the next succeeding business day not a legal holiday shall
be deemed to be payments within the period allowed for payment without penalty.
D. If a bill remains unpaid for a period of 30 days after the same becomes due and payable,

Title, Purpose and Jurisdiction
§ 395-1. Short title; When effective.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "The Borough of Birdsboro Zoning Ordinance Update
of 2010." This chapter shall become effective five days after adoption.
§ 395-2. Legislative intent.
This chapter is enacted for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals and the general welfare
of the Borough. It is to reflect the intent of the Borough's development objectives as stated in the Southern
Berks Regional Comprehensive Plan as adopted July 14, 2004. It is designed to lessen congestion in
the roads and highways, to secure safety from fire, panic and other danger, to provide adequate light and
air, to prevent the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue congestion of population, to facilitate the adequate
provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements, to conserve
the value of buildings, and to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the Borough.
§ 395-3. Interpretation; objectives.
A. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this article, they shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the health, safety, morals and the general welfare of the Bor§
395-4 ZONING § 395-4
395:6.1 01-04-2016
ough. The Comprehensive Plan in accordance with which this chapter is enacted and which is
reflected in the provisions of this chapter has been formulated to implement the purpose set forth
in § 395-2 hereinabove, in the respects therein stated and more particularly with a view toward,
inter alia, the following objectives:
(1) Guiding and encouraging the future development of the Borough in accordance with comprehensive
planning of land use and population density that represents the most beneficial
and convenient relationships among the residential, commercial, industrial and recreational
areas within the Borough, having regard to their suitability for the various uses
appropriate to each of them and their potentiality for such uses, as indicated by topography
and soil conditions, existing man-made conditions, and the trends in population, in the
direction and manner of the use of land, in building development and in economic activity,
considering such conditions and trends both within the Borough and with respect to the
relation of the Borough to surrounding areas;
(2) Protecting the character and the social and economic stability of each of such areas and
encouraging their orderly and beneficial growth;
(3) Protecting and conserving the value of land and buildings throughout the Borough,
depending on necessity of circumstances, appropriate to the various zoning districts established
herein;
(4) Bringing about through proper timing the gradual conformity of land use to the Comprehensive
Plan aforesaid and minimizing conflicts among the use of land and buildings;
(5) Aiding in bringing about the most beneficial relation between land use and the circulation
of traffic throughout the Borough, having particular regard to traffic to and from the
expressways and to avoidance of congestion in the streets and the provision of safe and
convenient access appropriate to the various land uses;
(6) Aiding in providing a guide for public policy and action in the efficient provision of public
facilities and services, in the provision of safe and proper semiprivate enterprise in building
development, investment, and other economic activity relating to land use.
B. Insofar as such objectives are consistent with the purpose set forth in § 395-2 and with the aforesaid
minimum requirements therefor, the provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted, administered
and applied in such manner as will facilitate attainment of the said objectives.
§ 395-4. Conflict.
It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or interfere with any existing ordinance or
enactment, or with any rule, regulation or permit adopted or issued thereunder, except insofar as the
same may be inconsistent or in conflict with any of the provisions of this chapter, provided that, where
this chapter imposes greater restrictions upon the use of buildings or land, or upon the height and bulk
of buildings, or prescribes larger open spaces than are required by the provisions of such ordinance,
enactment, rule, regulation or permit, then the provisions of this chapter shall control.

its maximum height above ground from all property lines.
395:26 07 - 01 - 2011

construction on adjoining or nearby properties. Any arrangements made to protect
the antenna's reception window shall be between private parties and not the
Borough.
(4) To protect aesthetics, such devices must be placed so that the dish is not visible
from the front of the property. If this results in the obstruction of the satellite's
reception window, every effort should be made to install the satellite dish in a way
that is least visually obtrusive to surrounding properties.

defined by Chapter 335, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 395-21. Division of developed lots.
No lot may be formed from part of a lot occupied by a building unless each newly created lot
will meet all the applicable provisions of this chapter and the Borough Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.
§ 395-22. Drainage.
A. Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out and graded to provide positive drainage away from
proposed and existing buildings and on-site sewage disposal facilities and to prevent the
collection of stormwater in pools. Topsoil layer of at least six inches shall be preserved
and redistributed as cover and shall be suitably planted with perennial grasses or ground
cover.
B. Nearby existing facilities. Where adequate existing storm sewers are readily accessible,
the developer must connect his stormwater facilities to these existing storm sewers.
C. Open drainageways. When open drainageways are used for the disposal of stormwater,
the Borough Engineer shall review the design of such open drainageways in relation to
the following:
(1) Safety. Steep banks and deep pools shall be avoided.
(2) Erosion. Adequate measures shall be taken, such as seeding, sodding, paving or
other measures as necessary, to prevent the erosion of banks and the scouring of
the channel.
(3) Stagnation. Design of open drainageways shall not create stagnant pools.
(4) Whenever the evidence available to the Borough indicates that natural surface
drainage is inadequate, the developer shall install storm sewers, culverts and
related facilities, as necessary, to:
(a) Permit the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses.
(b) Ensure the drainage of all low points along the line of streets.
(c) Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals reasonably related to the
extent and grade of the area drained.
(d) Provide adequate drainage away from on-site sewage disposal facilities.
395:34 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-22 ZONING § 395-24
D. Drainage upon adjacent properties. In the design of storm drainage facilities,
consideration must be given to preventing excess runoff onto adjacent developed or
undeveloped properties. In no case may a change be made in the existing topography
which would:
(1) Result in a slope of more than 70% within 20 feet of a property line (height
divided by length equals percent of slope).
(2) Alter the existing drainage or topography in any way so as to adversely affect
adjoining properties.
(3) Result in a slope which exceeds the normal angle of slippage of the material
involved. All slopes must be protected against erosion.
E. Drainage onto streets. In order to minimize improper surface water drainage upon streets,
each building erected, structurally altered, or relocated, and its driveway(s) or access
drive(s) must be at a grade in satisfactory relationship:
(1) With the established street grade; or
(2) With the existing street grade where none is established.
F. Obstruction to drainage prohibited. The damming, filling or otherwise interfering with
the natural or prescribed flow of a surface watercourse is not permitted without approval
of the Borough and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and other
agencies with jurisdiction.
G. Drainage facilities. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of
stormwater runoff in a safe and efficient manner. Plans shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Borough upon recommendation of the Borough Engineer. Drainage plans
shall be consistent with local and regional drainage plans, and shall comply with Chapter
325, Stormwater Management, of the Code of the Borough of Birdsboro, if applicable.
§ 395-23. Dumpsters and other waste receptacles.
A. Location. Dumpsters and other waste receptacles may be permanently placed on a
nonresidential lot if such receptacles are not located in or on any required parking area.
Such devices shall be included in calculated lot coverage.
B. Screening. Dumpsters and waste receptacles must be screened from the view of adjacent
residential uses.
§ 395-24. Dust and dirt, fly ash, fumes, vapors and gases.
A. No emission shall be made which can cause any damage to health, to animals or
vegetation or other forms of property or which can cause any excessive soiling at any
point.
B. No emission of liquid or solid particles from any chimney or otherwise shall exceed 0.3
grains per cubic foot of the covering gas at any point.
395:35 07 - 01 - 2011

to, roadways, areas of vehicular and pedestrian passage, loading areas, and
parking areas, fixtures, whether freestanding, wall-mounted, or any other
type, shall be aimed straight down and shall meet IESNA full-cutoff criteria.
(c) Where the use of fixtures meeting IESNA full-cutoff criteria is not practical
or possible, fixtures shall be equipped with aiming and/or light-redirecting
devices such as shields, visors, baffles, skirts or hoods when necessary to
direct or redirect offending light distribution.
395:38 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-26 ZONING § 395-26
( d) The use of floodlighting, spotlighting, non-cutoff wall-mounted fixtures,
internally illuminated decorative globes and spheres, lanterns and other
fixtures not meeting IESNA full-cutoff criteria shall be permitted only with
the approval of the Township, based upon acceptable justification and
achievement of adequate glare control.
(e) NEMA-head fixtures, also known as "barn lights" or "dusk-to-dawn lights,"
shall not be permitted where they are visible from other uses, unless fitted
with a reflector or shield to render them full-cutoff.
(3) Control of nuisance and disabling glare.
(a) All outdoor lighting, whether or not required by this chapter, on private,
residential, commercial, industrial, municipal, recreational or institutional
property shall be aimed, located, designed, fitted and maintained so as not to
present a hazard to drivers or pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely
traverse and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting or reflecting
objectionable light onto a neighboring use or property.
(b) The use of floodlights and spotlights shall be so installed or aimed that they
do not project their output beyond the boundaries of the property on which
they are located.
(c) Unless otherwise permitted by the Borough, e.g., for safety or security or
businesses that operate all night or past 11 :00 p.m., lighting for commercial,
industrial, municipal, recreational and institutional applications shall be
controlled by automatic switching devices such as time clocks or combination
motion detectors and photocells, to permit reducing or extinguishing outdoor
lighting fixtures between 11 :00 p.m. and dawn to mitigate light trespass,
nuisance glare and sky-lighting consequences.
( d) Lighting proposed for use after 11 :00 p.m. or after normal hours of operation
of a business, whichever is earlier, for commercial, industrial, institutional or
municipal applications, shall be reduced by at least 50% from then until
dawn, unless supporting a specific purpose and approved by the Borough.
(e) All illumination for advertising signs, buildings and/or surrounding
landscapes for decorative, advertising or aesthetic purposes is prohibited
between 11 :00 p.m. and sunrise, except that such lighting situated on the
premises of a commercial establishment may remain illuminated while the
establishment is actually open for business and until one hour after closing.
(f) Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary means for
controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall be achieved primarily through
the use of such means as cutoff fixtures, shields and baffles, and appropriate
application of fixture mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and fixture
placement.

§ 395-53 ZONING § 395-53
§ 395-53. Traditional neighborhood development.
A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to allow the optional development and
redevelopment of land consistent with the design principles of traditional neighborhoods.
A traditional neighborhood development (TND):
(1) Is compact;
(2) Is designed for the human scale;
(3) Provides a mix of uses, including complementary residential, commercial, civic,
and open space uses in close proximity to one another within the neighborhood in
order to facilitate human interactions and opportunities to meet daily retail, office
and service needs within walking distance of residences;
(4) Provides a mix of housing styles, types and sizes to accommodate households of
all ages, sizes and incomes;
(5) Incorporates a system of interconnected streets with sidewalks, bikeways, and/or
transit that offers multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists and
provides for the connections of those streets to existing and future developments;
(6) Retains existing buildings with historical features or architectural features that
enhance the visual character of the community;
(7) Incorporates significant envirorunental features into the design and provides green
space and recreational opportunities;
(8) Contains buildings which are oriented toward and define the streetscape; and
(9) Is consistent with the Southern Berks Regional Comprehensive Plan.
B. Applicability.
(1) Traditional neighborhood development may be developed on 10 acres or more of
contiguous land under single ownership at any location within the Mixed
Use/Employment Center District. A TND shall contain a minimum of 30 acres in
order to contain listed commercial uses. The Borough may allow commercial and
light industrial uses within smaller TNDs via the land development plan approval
process if the site of the TND is considered appropriate for commercial
development by location, access and market analysis. The Borough may also deny
commercial uses in a TND 30 acres or larger via the land development plan review
if the commercial uses proposed would have a detrimental effect on the TND,
surrounding neighborhoods or properties or streets abutting the TND, and/or such
commercial development is not supported by market analysis.
C. Design standards.
(1) Mix of uses. In order to achieve the proximity necessary to make neighborhoods
walkable, it is important to mix land uses. A traditional neighborhood development
shall consist of a mix of residential uses, a community center, and open space, as
listed below:
395:59 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-53 BIRDSBORO CODE § 395-53
(a) Residential uses.
[ 1] A mix of residential dwelling types shall be provided. The following
types can occur anywhere within the traditional neighborhood
development:
[a] Single-family detached dwellings;
[b] Single-family semidetached dwellings;
[c] Multifamily dwellings;
[d] Townhouses; and
[ e] Residential accessory uses.
[2] The minimum and maximum percentage of dwelling unit types in the
TND is as follows, according to the size of the TND:
Percentage of Total Dwelling Units in TND
TND Greater than 30 Acres TND 30 Acres or Less

Other uses.
[1] A community center, composed of a mix of commercial, residential,
civic or institutional, and open space uses, as identified below, must be
provided in a traditional neighborhood development of 50 acres or more
in size. The development shall be planned so that dwelling units are
within 1 /2 mile of the community center. The community center is
intended as a mixed-use area to provide uses which meet the retail and
service needs of residents within the TND and surrounding residential
development and provide compatible public and institutional uses of
community-wide importance. Drive-through facilities and drive-in
service are not permitted. Mixed-use buildings and live/work buildings
are permitted.
[2] The location of commercial uses is subject to land development plan
approval by the Borough and may be allowed on the periphery of the
TND site if designed to serve other residential developments in addition
395:60 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-53 ZONING § 395-53
to the TND. Such periphery commercial uses shall be buffered from
surrounding residential areas in a manner subject to approval by the
Borough. Nonresidential uses intended to serve an area beyond the TND
itself shall be located to permit vehicular access from outside the TND
to minimize traffic passing through neighborhood residential areas.
[a] Commercial uses in the community center. Individual businesses
shall not exceed 2,500 square feet m size. The following
pedestrian-oriented uses are permitted:
[i] Food services (such as neighborhood grocery stores; butcher
shops; bakeries; restaurants; delicatessens; cafes;
confectionery; coffee shops; neighborhood bars or pubs);
[ii] Retail uses (such as florists; hardware stores; news and
stationery stores; bookstores; studios and shops of artists and
artisans; pharmacies; music or video stores; convenience
store without gasoline service);
[iii] Services (such as day-care centers; music, dance or exercise
studios; health salons; professional and medical offices;
barber; hair salon; dry-cleaning shop; self-service laundry;
bank or other financial institution); and
[iv] Accommodations (bed-and-breakfast establishments, small
hotels or inns) .
. [b] Residential uses in the community center.
[i] Single-family semidetached dwellings;
[ii] Multifamily dwellings;
[iii] Townhouses;
[iv] Residential units located on upper floors above commercial
uses or to the rear of storefronts; and
[ v] "Live/work" units that combine a residence and the resident's
workplace.
[ c] Civic or institutional uses in the community center.
[i] Includes the following:
[A] Municipal offices, fire stations, libraries, museums,
community meeting facilities, and post offices;
[B] Transit shelters;

§ 395-53 BIRDSBORO CODE § 395-53
[ii] Civic or institutional uses shall abut or be visible from a
common open space area or park.
[ d] Open space uses in the community center.
[i] Includes the following:
[A] Central common open space area;
[BJ Neighborhood parks and common open space areas;
and
[C] Playground.
[ii] In addition to the open spaces within the community center,
open spaces shall be incorporated elsewhere in the traditional
neighborhood development. The TND shall contain a central
common open space area of a minimum of 20,000 square
feet in size and smaller common open space areas of a
minimum of 5,000 square feet in size. In no case shall the
central common open space area be less than 1.5% of the
gross acreage of the TND, provided that, in the case of a
TND substantially larger than the minimum required size,
the Borough may allow a lesser percentage. Each
neighborhood shall contain as its central focus at least one
common open space area or park. The size, distribution, and
number of greens are subject to approval by the Borough.
(c) Open space uses identified below shall be incorporated in the traditional
neighborhood development, as appropriate. Large outdoor recreation areas
should be located at the periphery of neighborhoods rather than central
locations. The design of the TND shall maximize the visibility of open
spaces as vistas and perimeter greenbelts.
[ 1] Environmental corridors;
[2] Protected natural areas;
[3] Community parks;
[4] Streams, ponds, lakes and other water bodies; and
[5] Significant tree stands and trees of high quality.
(2) TND standards.
(a) Common open space. At least 30% of the gross acreage of the traditional
neighborhood development must be common open space. At least 25% of the
common open space must be common open space devoted to usable parks,
greens, playgrounds and tot-lots. Ninety percent of the lots within the areas
devoted to residential uses shall be within 1/4 mile from common open
395:62 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-53 ZONING § 395-53
space. Large outdoor recreation areas should be located at the periphery of
neighborhoods rather than central locations.
(b) Density.
[l] The overall density of the development shall not exceed 5.5 dwelling
units per acre. For each affordable housing unit, as defined herein, one
additional dwelling unit shall be permitted up to a maximum density of
6.5 dwelling units per acre.
[2] The applicant shall demonstrate that the affordable housing units will be
sold or rented at a market rate for the target population and shall
provide acceptable arrangements for retaining those units for the target
population at the time of resale or re-renting. Affordable housing units
shall blend into the neighborhood in design and appearance and be
interspersed throughout the neighborhood rather than be concentrated in
a particular section.
(c) Commercial space. Where commercial uses are permitted by the Borough,
the minimum and maximum total ground floor areas of commercial uses, as a
percentage of the traditional neighborhood development, are as follows:

Commercial and civic or institutional buildings should abut the
sidewalks in the community center area.
(f) Setbacks from tract boundaries. All buildings shall be set back a minimum of
50 feet from tract boundaries. Where a road forms a tract boundary, the 50
feet shall be measured from the street right-of-way line. All common parking
areas shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from tract boundaries and
screened from view of surrounding properties. When townhouses and
apartments are located within 100 feet of a tract boundary and the abutting
land is used for single-family detached dwellings, a planting screen shall be
placed along the tract boundary between the townhouses and apartments and
the single-family detached dwellings.
(g) Public sanitary sewer and public water service are required.
(h) A green space of at least 25 feet in width shall be maintained along any tract
boundary which abuts lots with existing single-family detached dwellings.
Such green space shall be landscaped in accordance with a landscape plan
approved by the Borough.
(i) The total impervious coverage within the TND shall not exceed 45% of the
gross tract area.
(3) Architectural standards.
395:64 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-53 ZONING § 395-53
(a) Guidelines for existing structures. If existing structures have been determined
to be historic or architecturally significant, they shall be protected from
demolition or encroachment by incompatible structures or landscape
development. The U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation
of Historic Properties shall be used as the criteria for renovating historic or
architecturally significant structures.
(b) Guidelines for new structures.
[1] Height. New structures within a traditional neighborhood development
shall be no more than three stories and 35 feet for single-family
detached dwellings, single-family semidetached dwellings, and
townhouses, or three stories and 45 feet for commercial, apartment,
mixed-use buildings, and live/work buildings.
[2] Entries and facades.
[a] The architectural features, materials and the articulation of a facade
of a building shall be continued on all sides visible from a public
street, courtyard, common open space area, or park.
[b] The front facade of the principal building on any lot in a
traditional neighborhood development shall face onto a street or a
common open space area, courtyard or park or other common area,
if rear access is provided .
[ c] The front facade shall not be oriented to face directly toward a
parking lot, except when commercial uses are permitted to do so
by the Borough.
[ d] Architectural elements shall define the front entrance to all
residences.
[ e] New structures on the same street shall have compatible
architecture.
[ f] All residential, commercial, live/work and mixed-use buildings in a
neighborhood shall be compatible and form an integrated
streets cape.
[g] Garages shall be placed along alleys unless an alternative is
approved by the Borough, such as garages not served by an alley
shall have an architectural treatment or placement, such as being
set back from the front of the house or rotated, so that the garage
doors do not face any adjacent streets, to minimize the visual
impact of the garage.
[h] The facade of any building or row of buildings facing a street shall
incorporate windows and contain surface treatments to create
visual interest and break up visual massing of building facades.
395:65 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-53 BIRDSBORO CODE § 395-53
(c) Preparation and approval of architectural standards.
[1] Prior to final approval of the subdivision plan for a TND by the
Borough, the applicant shall prepare architectural standards which will
apply within the TND. These standards are subject to approval by the
Borough.
[2] Architectural elevation drawings of all typical residential and
nonresidential dwellings and buildings shall be provided to the Borough
as part of the development application. The style of architectural details,
such as, but not limited to, window fenestration, roof pitch, door style,
porch design, and facade materials and colors, shall be subject to
Borough approval.
( d) Exterior signage. A comprehensive sign program, subject to the approval of
the Borough, is required for the entire TND in order to establish a uniform
theme. Signs shall share a common style (such as shape or material). In the
community center area, signs shall be wall signs, projecting signs, or awning
signs. Projecting signs shall be mounted perpendicular to the building face
and shall not exceed eight square feet. Wall signs shall be sized and placed to
fit within the architectural elements but shall not exceed 16 square feet.
Awning signs shall maintain a clear height of at least l 0 feet and maximum
of six feet in depth out in front of the building. Material shall be canvas cloth
or an equivalent material, but in no case shall shiny or reflective material as
well as metal, plastic or glass be permitted. Lettering shall be limited to 12
inches vertically. Illumination of any sign shall be from a concealed indirect
source only.
(4) Circulation standards. The circulation system shall provide for different modes of
transportation. The circulation system shall provide functional links within the
residential neighborhoods, community center area, and open space and shall be
connected to existing and proposed external development when required by the
Borough. The circulation system shall provide adequate traffic capacity, provide
connected pedestrian and bicycle routes (especially off-street bicycle or multi-use
paths or bicycle lanes on the streets), and promote safe and efficient mobility
through the traditional neighborhood development.
(a) Pedestrian circulation. Convenient pedestrian circulation systems that
minimize pedestrian-motor vehicle conflicts shall be provided continuously
throughout the traditional neighborhood development. Where feasible and
appropriate, any existing pedestrian routes through the site shall be preserved
and enhanced. All streets, except for alleys, shall be bordered by sidewalks
on both sides unless otherwise permitted by the Borough. The following
provisions also apply:
[1] Residential sidewalks. Clear and well-lighted sidewalks built in
compliance with Borough ordinances shall connect all dwelling
entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk.
395:66 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-53 ZONING § 395-53

building entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk and to associated
parking areas. Such walkways shall be a minimum of five feet in width.
[3] Disabled accessibility. Sidewalks shall comply with the applicable
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
[4] Crosswalks. Intersections of sidewalks with streets shall be designed
with clearly defined edges. Crosswalks shall be well-lit and clearly
marked with contrasting paving materials at the edges or with other
method approved by the Borough.
(b) Bicycle circulation. Bicycle circulation shall be accommodated on streets
and/or on dedicated bicycle paths. Where feasible and appropriate, any
existing bicycle routes through the site shall be preserved and enhanced.
Facilities for bicycle travel may include off-street bicycle paths (generally
shared with pedestrians and other nonmotorized users) and separate, striped,
four-foot bicycle Janes on streets. If a bicycle lane is combined with a Jane
for parking, the combined width shall be 12 feet.
(c) Public transit access. Where public transit service is available or planned,
convenient access to transit stops shall be provided. Where transit shelters are
provided, they shall be placed in highly visible locations that promote
security through surveillance and shall be well-lighted .
( d) Motor vehicle circulation. Motor vehicle circulation shall be designed to
minimize conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Traffic-calming features
may be used to encourage slow traffic speeds.
(e) Street hierarchy. Each street within a traditional neighborhood development
shall be classified according to the following (arterial streets should not
bisect a traditional neighborhood development):
[ 1] Collector. This street provides access to commercial or mixed-use
buildings, but it is also part of the major street network. On-street
parking, whether diagonal or parallel, helps to slow traffic. Additional
parking is provided in lots to the side or rear of buildings.
[2] Local street. This street provides primary access to individual residential
properties. Traffic volumes are relatively low.
[3] Alley. These streets provide secondary access to residential properties.
Alleys may also provide delivery access or alternate parking access to
commercial properties.

The Borough may allow variation or relief from these standards. The Borough may also
allow alternative roadway concepts, such as one-way streets and yield streets.
Planting strips are not required in community center areas when permission is granted
by the Borough.
(f) Street layout. The traditional neighborhood development should maintain the
existing street grid, where present, and restore any disrupted street grid,
where feasible, and shall propose an interconnected street grid pattern.
Culs-de-sac are prohibited unless specific permission is granted by the
Borough.
[1] Street orientation. The orientation of streets should enhance the visual
impact of common open spaces and prominent buildings. All streets
shall terminate at other streets or at public land, public streetscape
feature, specifically designed building facade, or gateway to public
space, except local streets may terminate in stub streets when such
streets act as connections to future phases of the development. Local
streets may terminate other than at other streets or public land when
there is a connection to the pedestrian and bicycle path network at the
terminus.
[2] Alleys shall not form the boundary of a park, common open space area,
or greenbelt unless approved by the Borough. If approved, the Borough
may require that a wall or other screen a minimum of six feet in height
be used for separation.
395:68 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-53 ZONING § 395-53
[3] Generally, there shall be a continuous network of alleys to the rear of
lots within the TND, unless otherwise permitted by the Borough.
[4] To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and
create a sense of visual enclosure, long uninterrupted segments of
straight streets shall be avoided. Streets shall be interrupted by
intersections, a vista or notable street curve, or other traffic-calming
means acceptable to the Borough.
(g) Parking requirements.
(h)
(i)
(j)
[1] In the community center, any parking lot shall be located at the rear or
side of a building. If located at the side, landscaping acceptable to the
Borough shall be provided along the perimeter of the parking lot.
[2] A parking lot or garage may not be adjacent to or opposite a street
intersection, be adjacent to greens or parks, or occupy lots which
terminate a vista.
[3] Parking lots or garages must provide not less than one bicycle parking
space for every l 0 motor vehicle parking spaces.
[4] Adjacent on-street parking to a lot or building may apply toward the
minimum parking requirements.
[5] Adjacent parking lots shall have vehicular connections .
[6] Off-street parking may be located within 600 feet (measured along a
publicly accessible route) from the lot containing the use to which the
parking is accessory. The lot containing the parking shall be owned or
leased by the owner of the principal use, or the lot containing the
parking shall be dedicated to parking as long as the use to which it is
accessory shall continue and it is owned by an entity capable of
assuring its maintenance as accessory parking.
Service access. Access for service vehicles should provide a direct route to
service and loading dock areas while avoiding movement through parking
areas. Loading areas shall not be visible from public streets.
Trash disposal areas shall be located within buildings or an opaque screened
area which hides the trash and is located to the side or rear of the building.
Outdoor lighting.
[1] Streetlighting shall be provided along all streets in a manner acceptable
to the Borough. Generally, more smaller lights, as opposed to fewer
high-intensity lights, should be used, and streetlights shall be installed
on both sides of the street at intervals of no greater than 75 feet unless
alternative schemes are approved by the Borough. The design of
lighting shall be compatible with the architecture of the TND.
395:69 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-53 BIRDSBORO CODE § 395-53
[2] Exterior lighting shall reduce glare onto adjacent properties, and the
design of such lighting is subject to the approval of the Borough.
[3] All lighting shall be in accordance with § 395-26.
(5) Landscaping and screening standards. The composition and location of landscaping
shall complement the scale of the development and its surroundings. An overall
landscaping scheme shall be prepared and is subject to approval by the Borough.
Earthen berms may be incorporated into the landscaping scheme. The following
are minimum standards.
(a) General screening. Where screening is required by this chapter, it shall be at
least three feet in height, unless otherwise specified. Required screening shall
be at least fifty-percent opaque throughout the year. Required screening shall
be satisfied by one or some combination of a decorative fence not less than
fifty-percent opaque behind a continuous landscaped area; a masonry wall; or
a hedge.
(b) Street trees. A minimum of one deciduous canopy tree per 40 feet of street
frontage, or fraction thereof, shall be required. Spacing will be determined by
the species type. Large maturing trees shall generally be planted along
residential streets and along parks, greens, greenbelts and civic structures.
Small maturing trees shall generally be planted along nonresidential and
mixed-use streets. Trees can be clustered and do not need to be evenly
spaced. Trees should preferably be located between the sidewalk and the
curb, within the landscaped area of a boulevard, or in tree wells installed in
pavement or concrete. If placement of street trees within the right-of-way will
interfere with utility lines or if required by the Borough, trees may be planted
within the front or side yard setback adjacent to the sidewalk.
(c) Parking area landscaping and screening.
[ 1] All parking and loading areas fronting public streets or sidewalks and
all parking and loading areas abutting residential uses shall provide:
[a] A landscaped area at least five feet wide along the public street or
sidewalk.
[b] Screening at least three feet in height and not less than
fifty-percent opaque throughout the year.
[ c] One tree for each 25 linear feet of parking lot frontage.
[2] Parking area interior landscaping. The comers of parking lots, "islands,"
and all other areas not used for parking or vehicular circulation shall be
landscaped. Vegetation can include turf grass, native grasses or other
perennial flowering plants, vines, shrubs or trees. Such spaces may
include architectural features such as benches, kiosks or bicycle parking.
( d) Installation and maintenance of landscaping materials.

§ 395-54 ZONING § 395-54
395:71 01-04-2016
[1] All landscape materials shall be installed to current industry standards.
[2] Maintenance and replacement of landscape materials shall be the responsibility
of the property owner, homeowners' association, or condominium association.
Landscape maintenance should incorporate environmentally sound
management practices, including the use of water- and energy-efficient irrigation
systems such as drip irrigation, pruning primarily for plant health and
public safety, and replacing dead materials annually.
[3] Plantings in immediate proximity to buildings shall respect architectural
design. Plantings toward the street shall not obscure important buildings and
respect views to and from streets, porches, walks, and public open spaces.
(6) Stormwater management. The design and development of the traditional neighborhood
development should minimize off-site stormwater runoff, promote on-site filtration, and
minimize the discharge of pollutants to groundwater and surface water. Natural topography
and existing land cover shall be maintained/protected to the maximum extent practicable
and desirable.
§ 395-54. Unenclosed storage.
A. Vehicle storage.
(1) Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, in all districts, dismantled or partially dismantled
or abandoned automobiles, tractors, recreational vehicles, trailers and trucks must
be parked or stored within an enclosed building.
(2) In a residential zone, any noncommercial vehicle which exceeds eight feet in height and/or
exceeds 21 feet in length, when not placed within an enclosed building, shall be placed
between the rear wall of the principal building and the rear setback line. Such vehicles may
not be placed within a side setback area.
B. Outdoor stockpiling. Except as provided in other Borough ordinances, in residential or VC districts,
tire stockpiles, metal pipes, automobile parts, and similar objects and materials must be
stored in a garage or an enclosed storage structure. In a commercial or industrial zone, such items
must be stored in a garage or enclosed storage structure or be completely shielded by landscaping,
walls or fencing so as to screen the object(s) in all seasons of the year from the street or

may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, as amended, and this chapter. These conditions shall be enforceable by
the Zoning Officer, and failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation
of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties described in this chapter.
D. Site plan approval. Any site plan presented in support of the conditional use shall
become an official part of the record for said conditional use. Approval of any
conditional use will also bind the use in accordance with the submitted site plan;
therefore, should a change in the site plan be required as part of the approval of the use,
the applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the issuance of a zoning permit. Any
subsequent change to the use on the subject property not reflected on the originally
approved site plan shall require the property owner to secure another conditional use
approval.
E. Conduct of hearings.
(1) The Borough Council shall hold a public hearing upon an application for a
conditional use within 60 days after the filing of said application unless the
applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time. Each subsequent hearing
before the Borough Council shall be held within 45 days of the prior hearing,
unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant in writing or on the record. An
applicant shall complete the presentation of his case-in-chief within 100 days of
the first hearing. Upon the request of the applicant, the Borough Council shall
assure that the applicant receives at least seven hours of hearings within the 100
days, including the first hearing. Persons opposed to the application may, upon the
written consent or consent on the record by the applicant and municipality, be
granted additional hearings to complete their opposition to the application,
provided the applicant is granted an equal number of additional hearings for
rebuttal. At least 30 days prior to said hearing, the Borough Council shall submit
one copy of the application, together with the written material and data required by
this chapter, to the Borough Planning Commission to provide that Commission
with the opportunity to submit its recommendations with regard thereto.
(2) The Borough Council shall give written notice of any public hearing upon an
application for a conditional use to the applicant, the Zoning Officer, and any
person who has made timely request for the same. The Borough shall also give
public notice of any such public hearing in accordance with the provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.
(3) The parties to the hearing shall be the applicant, any person affected by the
application who has made timely appearance of record before the Borough
Council, and any other person, including civic or community organizations,
permitted to appear by the Borough Council. The Borough Council shall have
power to require that all persons who wish to be considered parties enter
appearances in writing on forms provided by the Borough Council for that
purpose.
395:117 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-154 BIRDSBORO CODE § 395-154
(4) The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and shall be afforded
the opportunity to present evidence and argument and to cross-examine adverse
witnesses on all relevant issues.
(5) Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial or unduly
repetitious evidence may be excluded.
(6) The Borough Council shall keep a stenographic record of the proceedings, and a
transcript of the proceedings and copies of the graphic or written material received
in evidence shall be made available to any party at cost.
F. Decision by the Borough Council.
(1) The Borough Council shall render a written decision upon application for a
conditional use within 45 days after the last public hearing before the Borough
Council. In authorizing or approving any such conditional use, the Borough
Council shall have power to attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Where the
application is contested or denied, each such written decision shall be accompanied
by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together with the reasons
therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the
provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in
light of the facts found. Where the Borough Council has power to render a
decision and fails to render the same within the period required by this section; or
fails to commence, conduct or complete the required hearing as provided for in this
section within 60 days from the date of the applicant's request for a hearing; or
fails to complete the hearing no later than 100 days after the completion of the
applicant's case-in-chief, unless extended for good cause upon application to the
Court of Common Pleas, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in
favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to
an extension of time. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any
party opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because
of the failure of the Borough Council to meet or render a decision as hereinabove
provided, the Borough Council shall give public notice of the decision within 10
days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in the same manner
as required by the public notice requirements of this act. If the Borough Council
shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so.
(2) A copy of the written decision shall be delivered to the applicant personally or
mailed to him not later than the day following its date. To all other persons who
have filed their name and address with the Borough Council not later than the date
of the last public hearing before the Borough Council, the Borough Council shall
provide by mail or otherwise brief notice of the decision and the statement of the
place at which the full decision may be examined.
G. General standards. Each applicant must demonstrate by credible evidence compliance
with the following:
395:118 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-154 ZONING § 395-154
( 1) The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter.
(2) The proposed use shall not detract from the use and enjoyment of adjoining and
nearby properties.
(3) The proposed use will not effect a change in the character of the subject property's
neighborhood.
(4) Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed use (e.g., schools,
fire, police and ambulance protection, sewer, water, recreation and other utilities,
vehicular access, etc.).
(5) For development within the floodplain zone, that the application complies with the
requirements of this chapter.
(6) The proposed use shall comply with those criteria specifically listed for that use in
this chapter. In addition, the proposed use must comply with all other applicable
regulations of this chapter.
(7) The proposed use will not adversely affect the integrity of the Southern Berks
Regional Comprehensive Plan.
(8) The peak traffic generated by the use shall be accommodated in a safe and
efficient manner and shall not materially increase traffic congestion on the roads
within the Borough .
(9) The use is properly designed with regard to internal circulation, parking, buffering
and all other elements of proper design.
H. Time limitation.
(1) If a conditional use is granted, the necessary permit shall be secured and the
authorized action begun within two years from the date that the conditional use
was finally granted; the building or alteration, as the case may be, shall be
completed within three years of said date. For good cause, the Borough Council
may at any time, upon application in writing, extend these deadlines.
(2) Should the applicant fail to obtain the necessary permits within the said two-year
period, or having obtained the permit should he fail to commence work hereunder
within such two-year period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the applicant
has waived, withdrawn or abandoned his application, and all approvals and permits
granted to him shall be deemed automatically rescinded by the Borough Council.
(3) Should the applicant commence construction or alteration within said two-year
period, but should he fail to complete such construction or alteration within said
three-year period, the Borough Council may, upon 10 days' notice in writing,
rescind or revoke the granted conditional use if the Borough Council finds that no
good cause appears for the failure to complete within such three-year period and if
the Borough Council further finds that conditions have altered or changed in the
interval since the granting of the conditional use such that revocation or rescission
of the action is justified.
395:119 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-154 BIRDSBORO CODE § 395-159
(4) As an alternative to the preceding, an applicant may request as part of the original
application before the Borough Council the granting of a timetable associated with
the request that would supersede the deadlines imposed above. In so doing, the
applicant must demonstrate that the times requested are logically related to normal
and expected progress of the project. In approving a timetable under this section,
the Borough Council must establish and bind a definite time frame for issuance of
a zoning permit and completion of construction.

of the Board to meet or render a decision as herein-above provided, the Board shall
give public notice of said decision within 10 days from the last day it could have

provision of the ordinance or map.
§ 395-166. Challenge to the validity of Zoning Ordinance or Map.
Except as provided in § 395-167 relating to variances, the Board shall have no power to pass
upon the validity of any provision of the Ordinance or Map adopted by Borough Council.
Recognizing that challenges to the validity of the Ordinance or Map may present issues of
fact and of interpretation which may lie within the special competence of the Board, and to
facilitate speedy disposition of such challenges by the court, the Board may hear all
challenges wherein the validity of the Ordinance or Map presents any issue or fact or of
interpretation not hitherto properly determined at a hearing before another competent agency
or body and shall take evidence and make a record thereon as herein prescribed. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall decide all contested questions of interpretation and
shall make findings on all relevant issues of fact which shall become part of the record on
appeal to the court.
§ 395-167. Variances.
A. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the appellant. The Board may grant
a variance, provided the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
395:124 07 - 01 - 2011
§ 395-167 ZONING § 395-170
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or
other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility
that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance, and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property;
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, not substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor
be detrimental to the public welfare; and
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will
afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in
issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
§ 395-168. Special exceptions.
Where this chapter has provided for stated special exceptions to be granted or denied by the
Board pursuant to express standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide requests for
such special exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria included in the zoning
districts and/or Article IV. In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of this act and the Zoning Ordinance.

Floodplain Regulations13
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Borough Council of the Borough of Birdsboro
6-11-2012 by Ord. No. 433. Amendments noted where applicable.]
Statutory Authorization
§ 395-176. General.
The legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Floodplain
Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt floodplain
management regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the Borough Council of the Borough of Birdsboro does hereby order as follows.
General Provisions
§ 395-177. Intent.
The intent of this article is to:
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its residents,
by preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
E. Comply with the federal and state floodplain management requirements.
§ 395-178. Applicability.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Borough of Birdsboro
unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
B. A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures per the UCC
and Act 92.
§ 395-179. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This article supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
13. Prior legislation: Ord. 435.
§ 395-180 BIRDSBORO CODE § 395-184
01-04-2016 395:128
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this article, the
more restrictive shall apply.
§ 395-180. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this article shall be declared invalid
for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this article, which
shall remain in full force, and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this article are hereby
declared to be severable.
§ 395-181. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of floodplain protection sought by the provisions of this article is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that
land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This article shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of Birdsboro or any officer or employee,
including the Engineer, thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Administration

enforce this article and is referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator.

A permit shall be required before any construction or development is undertaken within any area of the
Borough of Birdsboro per the PA UCC.
§ 395-184. Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
A. The Building Official shall issue a permit only after it has been determined that the proposed
work to be undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of this and all other applicable
codes and ordinances unless a new type of permit is created.
B. Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the application for
the permit to determine if all other necessary government permits required by state and federal
laws have been obtained, such as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act
1966-537, as amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 395-193. Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of the Borough of Birdsboro classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the
flood insurance study (FIS) and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated July
3, 2012, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent
revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the flood insurance study; and
B. Any community identified flood hazard area.
The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments are hereby
adopted by the Borough of Birdsboro and declared to be a part of this article.
§ 395-194. Description and special requirements of identified floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The floodway area/district identified as floodway in the FIS which represents the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any point.
This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other available studies
or sources of information for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified
in the FIS.
Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which base flood elevations have been provided
in the FIS but no floodway has been delineated.
In AE Area/District without a floodway, no new development shall be permitted unless it can be
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and projected development will not increase
the BFE by more than one foot.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA and for which no one percent annual chance flood elevations have been provided.
For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available,
the elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
§ 395-195 ZONING § 395-198
395:135 01-04-2016
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analysis shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect current accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
D. No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured 50 feet landward
from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection regional office.
§ 395-195. Changes in identification area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough Council where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable,
but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall
notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 395-196. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be
made by the Borough of Birdsboro Planning Commission and any party aggrieved by this decision or
determination may appeal to the Borough Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 395-197. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are proposed or
have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to annexation
or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Technical Provisions
§ 395-198. General.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action have been notified
by the municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have been first obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the flood carrying
capacity of the watercourse in any way.

does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a substantial improvement
as defined in this article, must comply with all Article requirements that do not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific Article requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of
§ 395-214 BIRDSBORO CODE § 395-214
01-04-2016 395:152
Historic Places must be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation
Officer. Any exemption from this article requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.

PREFACE
History
Birdsboro was named after its founder, William Bird, who took warrants for land on Haycreek
Road and, later, ~ix Penny Creek as early as 173 7. On the banks of Hay creek, he established a
forge in about 1740, which was followed by other forges along the creek, as well as a sawmill and
gristmill. Between 1737 and 1751, he took up warrants for about 1600 acres of land. He died in
1761. Marcus Bird, a son, succeeded his father. He enlarged his father's work in Haycreek and
built a furnace on French Creek at Hopewell. He was the largest producer of iron in America during
the Revolutionary War.
When Berks County was constituted in 1762, Birdsboro was already a town of considerable size.
In 1796, Matthew Brooke purchased all of the lands owned by the Bird family, including all
forges and mills. Matthew Brooke died in 1821 and his two sons became exclusive owners in
183 7. They later became organized in to the E & G Brooke Iron Co., and their influence made the
growth of the town possible.
The Borough of Birdsboro has, over the years, passed through a process of legislative change
common to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were necessary at the
time of the establishment of the Borough, subsequent growth of the community, together with the
complexity of modern life, has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the
proper function and government of the Borough. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal
history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and
consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection
of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more
than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and
logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as
these in mind that the Borough Council ordered the following codification of the Borough 's legislation.
Contents of Code
The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation of a general and permanent
nature enacted by the Borough Council of the Borough of Birdsboro, including revisions
or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the Borough Council in the course of
the codification.

BIRDSBORO CODE
Division of Code
The Code is divided into parts. Part I, Administrative Legislation, contains all Borough legislation
of an administrative nature, namely, that dealing with the administration of government, that establishing
or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the
municipal government and its departments. Part II, General Legislation, contains all other Borough
legislation of a regulatory nature. Items of legislation in this part generally impose penalties
for violation of their provisions, whereas those in Part I do not.
Table of Contents and
Grouping of Legislation
The Table of Contents details the arrangement of material alphabetically by chapter as a means of
identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more items of legislation have been
combined by the editor into a single chapter, the use of article designations has preserved the
identity of the individual enactments, and the titles of the articles are listed beneath the chapter
title in order to facilitate location of the individual enactments.
Reserved Chapters
Unassigned chapter numbers do not appear in the Table of Contents but are available for assignment
to new enactments. In this manner, new subject matter can be included alphabetically.
Pagination
A unique page-numbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous
unit. The first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a colon and the numeral
"l." Thus, Chapter 6 would begin on page 6: 1. By use of this system, it is possible to add
or to change pages in any chapter, or add new chapters, without affecting the sequence of subsequent
pages.
Numbering of Sections
A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed in which the section number indicates
the number of the chapter and the location of the section within that chapter. Thus, the first section
of Chapter 30 would be§ 30-1, while the sixth section of Chapter 57 would be§ 57-6.
Scheme
The scheme is the list of section titles that precedes the text of each chapter. These titles are carefully
written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the content of the
chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section. For ease and precision
of reference, the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text.

PREFACE
Histories
At the end of the Scheme (list of section titles) in each chapter is located the legislative history for
that chapter. This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was
derived, including the enactment number, if pertinent, and the date of adoption. In the case of
chapters containing parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation, the source of
each part or article is indicated in the text, under its title. Amendments to individual sections or
subsections are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text.
General References; Editor's Notes
In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table of General References
is included to direct the reader's attention to such related chapters. Editor's Notes are used
in the text to provide supplementary information and cross-references to related provisions in
other chapters.
Appendix
Certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main body of the
Code but are of such significance that their application is community-wide or their provisions are
germane to the conduct of municipal government. The Appendix of this publication is reserved
for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include .
Disposition List
The Disposition List is a chronological listing of legislation, indicating its inclusion in the publication
or the reason for its exclusion. The Disposition List will be updated with each supplement
to the Code to include the legislation reviewed with said supplement.
Index
The Index is a guide to information. Since it is likely that this publication will be used by persons
without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate a
particular section quickly. Each section of each chapter has been indexed. The Index will be supplemented
and revised from time to time as new legislation is added.
Instructions for Amending the Code
All changes to the Code, whether they are amendments, deletions or additions, should be adopted
as amendments to the Code. In doing so, existing material that is not being substantively altered
should not be renumbered.
Adding new sections. Where new sections are to be added to a chapter, they can be added at the
end of the existing material (continuing the numbering sequence) or inserted between existing
111 07-01-2011
BIRDSBORO CODE
sections as decimal numbers (e.g., a new section between §§ 65-5 and 65-6 should be designated
§ 65-5.1).
Adding new chapters. New chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence in the
appropriate division or part (e.g., Part I, Administrative Legislation, or Part II, General Legislation),
utilizing the reserved chapter numbers. New chapter titles should begin with the key word
for the alphabetical listing (e.g., new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled "Vehicles,
Abandoned" under "V" in the Table of Contents, and a new enactment on coin-operated amusement
devices should be "Amusement Devices" or "Amusement Devices, Coin-Operated" under
"A" in the Table of Contents). Where a reserved number is not available, an "A" chapter should
be used (e.g., a new chapter to be included between Chapters 166 and 167 should be designated
Chapter 166A).
Adding new articles. New articles may be inserted between existing articles in a chapter (e.g.,
adding a new district to the Zoning Regulations) by the use of "A" articles (e.g., a new article to
be included between Articles XVI and XVII should be designated Article XVIA). The section
numbers would be as indicated above (e.g., if the new Article XVIA contains six sections and
existing Article XVI ends with § 166-30 and Article XVII begins with § 166-31, Article XVIA
should contain§§ 166-30.1through166-30.6).
Supplementation
Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation. New legislation or
amendments to existing legislation will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible
after passage. Supplemental pages should be inserted as soon as they are received and old
pages removed, in accordance with the Instruction Page which accompanies each supplement.
Acknowledgment
The assistance of the Borough officials is gratefully acknowledged by the editor. The codification
of the legislation of the Borough of Birdsboro reflects an appreciation of the needs of a progressive
and expanding community. As in many other municipalities, officials are faced with fundamental
changes involving nearly every facet of community life. Problems increase in number and
complexity and range in importance from everyday details to crucial areas of civic planning. It is
the profound conviction of General Code that this publication will contribute significantly to the
efficient administration of local government. As Samuel Johnson observed, "The law is the last
result of human wisdom acting upon human experience for the benefit of the public."
