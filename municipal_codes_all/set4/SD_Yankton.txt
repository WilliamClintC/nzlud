PREFACE 
    In March 2011, Municipal Code Corporation reformatted this Code, and Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time by the Ordinance in Revision. 
    The numbering system used is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 20 is 20-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections can be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3, respectively. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions to provide for future expansion. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number, i.e., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

State Law reference- Authority to revise ordinances, SDCL 1967, § 9-19-16. 
Sec. 1-2. - Catchlines of sections. 
    The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted. 
Sec. 1-3. - Rules of construction and definitions. 
    In the construction of this Code, the following rules shall be observed and the following definitions shall apply, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the council: 
    Generally. The provisions of this Code shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes expressed therein or implied from the expression thereof. In case of doubt or ambiguity in the meaning of such provisions, the general shall yield to the particular. Reference for interpretation and construction shall tend to further the accomplishment of the elimination of the particular mischiefs for which the provisions were enacted. Words shall be construed in their common and usual significance unless the contrary is clearly indicated. 
    Board of commissioners shall mean the Board of Commissioners of the City of Yankton, constituting the governing body. 
    City. The words "the city" or "this city" shall mean the City of Yankton, in the County of Yankton, and the State of South Dakota. 
    City manager shall mean the City Manager of the City of Yankton. The term "city manager" shall also include any person the city manager shall designate in writing, filed with the finance officer or, in his absence or failure to designate, the mayor. 
    Code. The term "Code" or "this Code" shall be taken to mean the Code of Ordinances of the City of Yankton in its entirety, including each and every section thereof. The entire Code is intended by the board of commissioners to constitute an ordinance in revision of the ordinances of the city, within the meaning of sections 9-19-16 and 9-19-17 of the South Dakota Compiled Laws, 1967. 
    Computation of time. In computing any period of time mentioned in the provisions of this Code, the day of the act, event or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included, and the last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Sunday or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Sunday nor a holiday. 
    County. The term "county" or "this county" shall mean the County of Yankton, South Dakota. 
    Duties performed by agents. Wherever in this Code, any act is required to be done by an officer in the line of his general duties, or by a department head or inspector, the same shall be construed to permit the doing of such act by the agent or subordinate of such person; provided that the agent or subordinate is duly authorized and duly qualified to perform such act. Such rule shall apply also to license holders, where such act is not otherwise required to be performed personally by such person, either by specific law or by the nature of such act. 
    Gender. A word importing the masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to females and to firms, partnerships, associations and corporations, as well as to males. 
    Joint authority. Words purporting to give authority to three (3) or more officers or other persons shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it is otherwise declared. 
    Month. The word "month" shall mean a calendar month. 
    Number. Any word importing the singular number shall include the plural and any word importing the plural number shall include the singular. 
    Oath. The word "oath" shall be construed to include an affirmation in all cases in which, by law, an affirmation may be substituted for an oath, and in such cases, the words "swear" and "sworn" shall be equivalent to the word "affirm" and "affirmed." 
    Officers and employees. Whenever reference is made in this Code to a city officer or employee by title only, this shall be construed as though followed by the words "of the City of Yankton" and shall be taken to mean the officer or employee of this city having the title mentioned or performing the duties indicated. 
    Or, and. "Or" may be read "and," and "and" may be read "or," if the sense requires it. 
    Person. The word "person" shall extend and be applied to associations, corporations, firms, partnerships and bodies politic and corporate as well as to individuals. 
    Signature, subscription. The words "signature" or "subscription" shall include a mark when a person cannot write. 
    State. The words "the state" or "this state" shall be construed to mean the State of South Dakota. 
    Tense. Words used in the past or present tense include the future as well as the past and present. 
    Variations in punctuation; typographical errors; etc. No variation in punctuation, either formal or informal, consistent or not, shall affect the validity of this Code, nor shall obvious or apparent defects in spelling or typography be construed as to invalidate any portion hereof, so long as the purpose and intent of the section is clear. 
    Wholesaler, wholesale dealer. In all cases where the words "wholesaler" or "wholesale dealer" are used in this Code, unless otherwise specifically defined, such terms shall be understood to relate to the sale of goods, merchandise, articles or things in quantity to persons who purchase for the purpose of resale, as distinguished from a retail dealer who sells in smaller quantities direct to the consumer. 
    Written, in writing. The words "written" or "in writing" shall be construed to include any representation of words, letters or figures, whether by printing or otherwise. 
    Year. The word "year" shall mean a calendar year.

(b)  The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinances in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect. 
Sec. 1-7. - Liability of corporations for violations. 
    For a violation of this Code or any other ordinance of the city which, by nature, does not require intent exercisable only by natural persons, a corporation may be fined or punished by appropriate penalties in addition to any punishment provided for its agents who violate this Code or other ordinance while acting as such agents. 
Sec. 1-8. - General penalty; continuing violations 
    Under South Dakota law, misdemeanors are divided into two (2) classes, class 1 and class 2, which are distinguished from each other by the penalty. This Code of Ordinances does not contain class 1 misdemeanors. The maximum penalty for a class 2 misdemeanor is thirty (30) days imprisonment in a county jail, a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fine, or both. The maximum penalty for a petty offense is two hundred dollars ($200.00). Unless otherwise noted herein, the sentencing court shall have discretion regarding the penalty to be imposed. 
    Unless otherwise noted, it is presumed that each of the offenses prohibited by this Code is a class 2 misdemeanor. 
    Each day any violation of this Code or other ordinance continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 639, § 1, 5-28-91; Ord. No. 694, 1-13-14) 
Cross reference- Penalty for violation of chapter regulating motor vehicles in traffic, § 14-9; abatement of nuisances, § 15-1. 
Sec. 1-9. - Complaints; enforcement of judgments. 
    When a complaint shall be filed charging the violation of any provision of this Code or other city ordinance, instead of requesting the arrest of the person, the complaint may state that a summons be issued as permitted in that court, or, at any time before the trial of the action, the city attorney may file his written request in the court having jurisdiction that a summons be issued on the complaint to recover the fine or penalty provided by section 1-8, or by other city ordinance for the violation; that in case the fine or penalty to be recovered in such action shall be the maximum amount of any such fine or penalty for such violation, and the action shall be tried and determined according to the rules of courts in civil actions, and in such cases the judgment of the court may be enforced by execution and all remedies available for the collection of a civil judgment, or by arrest and confinement of the defendant as provided by the laws of the state. 
(Ord. No. 182, § 3, 10-5-53) 
Sec. 1-10. - Prosecution's election when offense created by more than one section. 
    In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by different clauses or sections of this Code, the prosecuting officer may elect under which to proceed, but not more than one (1) recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense; provided, that the revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar any other penalty being enforced. 
Sec. 1-11. - Repeal. 
    All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict with the provisions of this Code or relating to the subject matter of this Code and not reenacted as a part of this Code are hereby repealed, except as otherwise specifically provided.

    Except as otherwise expressly provided, all powers and authorities conferred by any provision of this Code shall be cumulative and additional to, and not in derogation of, any powers and authorities otherwise existing. Notwithstanding any other evidence of intent, it is hereby declared to be the controlling intent of the board of commissioners that, if any provision of this Code or the application thereof to any persons or circumstances, shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of this Code, or its application to other persons and circumstances, but such judgment shall be confined in its operation to the provisions of the particular chapter, section, subsection or provision involved, or the application thereof to the persons and circumstances directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment is rendered.

    The board of city commissioners of the city specifically finds that establishments which serve alcoholic beverages and which also have dancing as defined in subsection 4-48(b)(1) have higher incidents of law infractions than establishments without dancing as defined in subsection 4-48(b)(1). As a result of these findings, there is a greater need to license and regulate the prior establishments in order to protect the natural character of neighborhoods and businesses from such secondary effects as crime or reduction of property values.

    If the board of city commissioners of the city is satisfied that the applicant for a dance hall license has property character to operate a dance hall and the location is a proper place at which to conduct public dances, it shall approve the issuance of the license after having the premises inspected by the proper officers of the city in order to ensure that the premises conform to the provisions of this Code and other ordinances of the city and the laws of the state.

(b)  Whether the animal has bitten anyone. 
(c)  Previous aggressive history of the animal. 
(d)  Observable behavior of the animal. 
(e)  Site and circumstances of the incident. 
(f)  Statements from interested parties. 
(Ord. No. 962, 11-11-13, eff. 12-13-13; Ord. No. 983, 11-9-15) 
Sec. 5-104. - Authority. 
    The animal control officer is hereby authorized and empowered to take possession and to impound any animal suspected of being a dangerous animal. 
    If the animal control officer or certified law enforcement officer determines that an animal presents an immediate danger to the life of any person(s), then the officer, due to the exigent circumstances, may use lethal force to seize or to destroy the animal. 
(Ord. No. 962, 11-11-13, eff. 12-13-13; Ord. No. 983, 11-9-15) 
Sec. 5-105. - Release. 
    If the animal control officer concludes that the animal is not dangerous, then the animal shall then be returned to the owner after it is verified that it and the owner are in compliance with all applicable city ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 962, 11-11-13, eff. 12-13-13) 
Sec. 5-106. - Determination of dangerousness. 
    If the animal control officer, after conducting his or her investigation and applying the dangerousness factors section 5-103, concludes that an animal constitutes a dangerous animal, then the animal shall be impounded with intent to euthanize. 
(Ord. No. 962, 11-11-13, eff. 12-13-13; Ord. No. 983, 11-9-15) 
Sec. 5-107. - Impoundment notice. 
    If the impounded animal is licensed or if the owner is known to the animal control officer, then the animal control officer shall at his or her earliest convenience mail written notice of the impoundment to the owner of the animal by first class mail sent to the owner's last known address. 
    If the animal is unlicensed and the owner of the animal is not known to the animal control officer, then the animal control officer shall either post a written notice containing the information required for the registry at a conspicuous place in the county courthouse or publish the same on the city's website. 
(Ord. No. 962, 11-11-13, eff. 12-13-13; Ord. No. 983, 11-9-15) 
Sec. 5-108. - Impoundment hearing. 
    The owner of the animal may consent to the impoundment and euthanization without civil action, consent to an expedited trial date, and/or waive the right to trial. Upon impoundment with intent to euthanize the animal, unless the owner of the animal cannot be located or unless the owner of the animal consents to the impoundment and euthanization, the city shall commence a civil action against the owner seeking an order from the court permitting euthanization of the animal in accordance with this article. Regardless of whether the owner consents to an expedited trial or consents to impoundment and/or euthanization, the owner shall remain responsible for all costs of impoundment. Trial shall be scheduled as expeditiously as permitted by the applicable rules of civil procedure. Notice of the trial shall also be provided to the owner and complainant, if any. At trial, the city shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the determination of dangerousness by the animal control officer was proper in accordance with this article. 
    If the court finds the animal control officer properly determined the animal to be dangerous, it shall issue an order permitting the city to humanely euthanize the animal. The court shall also identify the costs of impoundment then owed by the owner and include a judgment for the same in favor of the city and against the owner. If the court determines that the animal control officer improperly determined the animal to be dangerous, then the animal shall be returned to the owner if the owner and animal are in compliance with all applicable ordinances. 
    If the owner of the dangerous animal appeals the court's decision, then the owner shall continue to be responsible for all impoundment costs. Interest on such costs shall accrue at the category C rate, as found at SDCL 54-3-16(3).

ARTICLE IV. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[3] 
Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 932, adopted May 24, 2010, repealed the former Art. IV, §§ 11-54-11-91, and enacted a new Art. IV as set out herein. The former Art. IV pertained to flood control and derived from Ord. No. 504, adopted June 23, 1980. See the Code Comparative Table for full derivation. 

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 11-54. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of South Dakota has in (statute) SDCL § 9-36-15 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Yankton Board of Commissioners does ordain as follows: The City of Yankton South Dakota elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-488, as amended). The National Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas of the city having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program was broadened and modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The National Flood Insurance Program is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
(Ord. No. 932, 5-24-10) 
Sec. 11-55. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 932, 5-24-10) 
Sec. 11-56. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas. 
(Ord. No. 932, 5-24-10) 
Sec. 11-57. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 932, 5-24-10) 
DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 11-58. - Specific definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its' most reasonable application. 
    Area of future-conditions flood hazard - means the land area that would be inundated by the one-percent-annual-chance (100-year) flood based on future-conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding - means a designated AO and AH, zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one (1) per cent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard - is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) per cent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard". 
    Base flood - means the flood having a one (1) per cent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) - is the water surface elevation of the one (1) per cent annual chance flood. The height in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of coastal and riverine areas. 
    Basement - means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall - means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction - means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before August 15, 1980, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision - means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision - means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding - means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) - Means an official map of a community, issued by the administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, related erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) - means an official map of a community, on which the administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study - is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the associated FIRM and FHBM maps. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area - means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding").

    Floodplain management regulations - means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance), and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system - means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodproofing - means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway - see regulatory floodway. 
    Floodway encroachment lines - mean the lines marking the limits of floodways on federal, state and local floodplain maps. 
    Freeboard - means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent use - means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade - means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

    Levee - means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system - means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor - means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Regulations. 
    Manufactured home - means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

(d)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Regulatory  floodway - means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Riverine - means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), streams or brooks. 
    Special hazard area - means an area having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, AO, AH, AR, A99, VE, V, X or D. 
    Start of construction - (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure - means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage - means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) per cent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement - means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) per cent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance - is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation - means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation - means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(1)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(2)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the federal emergency management agency and the state office of emergency management upon issuing a variance. 
(3)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 11-70(7), variance procedure, (b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(4)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article. 
(5)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway. 
(6)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(7)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(8)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  The criteria outlined in subsections 11-70(1) through (8) (variance procedure), are met, and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 15-12. - Declaration of public interest in disposal. 
    Abandoned or junked motor vehicles and other scrap metals constitute a hazard to the health and welfare of the people of the city in that such vehicles and other scrap metals can harbor noxious diseases, furnish shelter and breeding places for vermin and present physical danger to the safety and well-being of children and other citizens. Abandoned or junked motor vehicles and other scrap metals also constitute a blight on the landscape of the city and, therefore, are a detriment to the environment. The indiscriminate abandonment and retirement of motor vehicles and other scrap metals constitutes a waste of valuable sources of useful metal. It is therefore in the public interest that the present accumulation of abandoned or junked motor vehicles and other scrap metals be eliminated; that future abandonment or junking of motor vehicles and other scrap metals be discouraged; that the expansion of existing scrap recycling facilities be developed; and that other acceptable and economically useful methods for the disposal of abandoned or junked motor vehicles and other scrap metals be developed.

(f)  It is the express policy of the board of city commissioners that once a water service is terminated for nonpayment of bills, the service shall not be restored until all unpaid bills are paid and become current. The purpose of establishing the appeal procedure contained in this section is to allow proper notice to both the customer and if appropriate, the property owner to allow for due process prior to the termination of utility service. It is the policy of the board of city commissioners that should a customer not pay a bill for a property not owned by the customer and the water service is terminated after following the procedures contained in this section for nonpayment of the bill, the service shall not be restored until the past due bill is paid by either the customer or the property owner. The city manager and finance officer are authorized and directed to implement this policy on behalf of the city. 
(g)  Alternative resolution procedure for unpaid bills. The finance officer of the city is hereby authorized to enter into payment agreements with customers who are delinquent in their bills. The payment agreement shall be on a form developed and approved by the finance officer of the city and shall be executed by the customer or property owner, and by the finance officer or designee on behalf of the city. The failure of a customer or property owner to comply with the terms of the payment agreement shall be grounds for termination of service without further notice.

(3)  When, after making such a review, the director concludes that, before the person discharges his wastes into the public sewers, he must modify or eliminate those constituents which would be harmful to the structures, processes or operations of the sewage treatment plant or injurious to health, then the person shall either modify his wastes at the point of origin or shall provide and operate at his own expense such preliminary treatment or processing facilities as may be determined to be necessary to render his wastes acceptable for admission to the public sewers. 
(4)  Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment or processing facilities shall be submitted to the city for examination and approval; and no construction of such facilities shall begin until the city, through its board of commissioners, has given its written approval. Such approval shall not exempt the person from the obligation to make further reasonable adaptations of such facilities when such adaptations prove necessary to secure the results desired. The approval of proposed facilities or equipment by the city does not in any way guarantee that these facilities or equipment will function in the manner described by their constructor or manufacturer, nor shall it relieve a person of the responsibility of enlarging or otherwise modifying such facilities to accomplish the intended purpose. 
(5)  Where such preliminary treatment facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operating condition by the person at his own expense and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the city. The person shall maintain suitable operating records and shall submit to the director such monthly summary reports of the character of the influent and effluent as the latter may prescribe. 
(6)  Whenever the director determines that interceptors or traps are needed to protect the sewerage system or the operations of the sewage treatment plant from grease, oil, sand or similar substances occurring in a user's sewage, then such traps shall be installed by the user on his own lines at his own expense and shall be so maintained by him that none of such substance can be carried over into the public sewers. All traps shall meet the city's standards as to construction, location and installation. 
(7)  It shall be the responsibility of the sewer user to notify the superintendent immediately of any accidental spill or discharge of any substance that may be restricted, prohibited or limited by any provision of this article. 
(Ord. No. 443, 6-13-77) 
Sec. 26-77. - Control of admissible industrial wastes. 
(1)  Any person who discharges industrial wastes into the city's sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, shall, upon the written request of the board of commissioners, fill out and file with the city within ninety (90) days an industrial waste questionnaire to be furnished by the city, in which he shall set out the quantity and characteristics of the wastes discharged into the city's sewerage system. Similarly, any person desiring to establish a new connection to a public sewer for the purpose of discharging industrial wastes shall be required to fill out and file such a questionnaire, which shall include actual or predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the wastes to be discharged. 
(2)  When special circumstances such as the size or complexity of his sewage disposal problem would make complying with the time schedule cited above an unreasonable burden on the person, an extension of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, may be granted by the board of commissioners upon presentation of a proper application. 
(3)  Any person discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer, either directly or indirectly, may be required by the board of commissioners, upon the recommendation of the director, to construct and maintain at his own expense one (1) or more control manholes or structures at a specified location or locations to facilitate the observation, measurement and sampling of his wastes. Such manholes or structures shall be constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications of the city. The board may also require the person to install and maintain in any such manhole or structure at said person's expense an approved volume-measuring device. Plans for the installation of control manholes or structures and related equipment must be approved by the board of commissioners, upon the recommendation of the director and the superintendent, before construction is begun. 
(4)  Any industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and determination of character and concentration. The examination shall be made as often as the superintendent deems it necessary and may include the use of suitable continuously monitoring instruments in appropriate cases. Samples shall be collected either manually or by approved mechanical devices and in such a manner as to be representative of the overall composition of the wastes. 
(5)  The installation, operation and maintenance of sampling facilities shall be the responsibility of the person discharging the wastes and shall be subject to the approval of the board of commissioners. Access to sampling facilities shall be granted to the board of commissioners, the director, the superintendent or their duly authorized representatives at any time when there is a discharge to the public sewers from a user. 
(6)  Where a person's operations have security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry onto said person's property is granted, such person or persons shall make the necessary arrangements with their security guards that upon showing proper identification personnel from the city will be permitted to enter without delay for the purpose of obtaining samples of wastes or monitoring of wastes being discharged at various sampling points, or the person or persons shall install suitable sampling manholes or structures outside of the security limits, which will at all times be immediately available to city personnel subject to the provisions of this article. 
(7)  Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial wastes shall be those set forth in Standard Methods or Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants as set forth in 40 CFR part 136. However, alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes may be used subject to mutual agreement between the superintendent and the user provided that the precision and accuracy of the alternative method is comparable to the above accepted laboratory procedures. The city shall make, without charge to the user, the initial analysis and regular periodic check analyses of the user's wastes as well as other tests the superintendent may deem advisable. Analyses made by the city at the request of the user shall be charged to the user according to the utility's standard work order billing practices. All such analyses shall be binding in determining strength of wastes surcharges and other matters dependent upon the character and concentration of wastes. 
(8)  Until an adequate analysis of a representative sample of user's wastes has been obtained, the city may, for the purpose of this article, make a determination of the character and concentration of his wastes by using data based on analyses of similar processes or data for this type of business that are available from the United States Environmental Protection Agency or from industry-recognized authoritative sources. This method, if selected by the city, shall continue at the city's pleasure or until an adequate analysis has been made. 
(9)  No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern provided that the agreement or arrangement shall not allow discharges which would cause the waste water treatment plant to violate applicable local, state or federal permits, regulations or requirements.

(2)  Class II: Industrial and commercial establishments that discharge wastewater with an average daily five-day twenty-degree Celsius BOD not exceeding two hundred twenty (220) mg/l or an average daily TSS not exceeding two hundred fifty (250) mg/l. 
(3)  Class III: Industrial and commercial establishments that discharge wastes that exceed the parameters of class II users. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 1, 11-10-97) 
Sec. 26-95. - Determining the wastewater system five-day twenty-degree Celsius BOD and TSS surcharges and other significant surcharges. 
    The city commission shall by resolution adopt a surcharge per pound for an average daily five-day twenty-degree Celsius BOD exceeding two hundred twenty (220) mg/l, an average daily TSS exceeding two hundred fifty (250) mg/l, and any other significant chemical and physical characteristic which requires additional treatment. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 1, 11-10-97) 
Sec. 26-96. - Determining each user's total wastewater service charge. 
(a)  Class I users. 
(1)  The owner or occupant of each residential premises connected to the municipal water works and wastewater system shall pay for the use and availability of such wastewater disposal service a user service charge computed by multiplying the incremental cost, as adopted by resolution of the city commission, by the volume of water consumed in thousand-gallon units, for a unit of time, plus a minimum fixed cost per month, as adopted by resolution of the city commission. The wastewater user service charge for any class I user during the period of April 1 through March 31 shall be based on the average amount of water consumption during the previous winter period as established by resolution of the city commission. 
(2)  For any class I user beginning to discharge to the wastewater system when water meter readings during the previous winter base period are not available, the city commission may establish by resolution a substitute period base ceiling calculated on average residential winter meter readings until the base period for the purpose of determining said maximum charge shall have occurred. 
(b)  Class II users. 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, the owner or occupant of each industrial and commercial premises connected to the municipal waterworks and wastewater system, meeting the criteria of section 26-94 for a class II user, shall pay for the use and availability of such wastewater disposal service a user service charge computed by multiplying the incremental cost, as adopted by resolution of the city commission, by the volume of water consumed in thousand-gallon units, for a unit of time, plus a minimum fixed cost per month, as adopted by resolution of the city commission. 
(2)  The governing body of the municipality may classify industrial and commercial establishments as a class I residential user, provided that the wastes from these establishments are equivalent to the wastes from a residential user with respect to volume, TSS, five-day twenty-degree Celsius BOD, and other significant chemical and physical characteristics. 
(c)  Class III users. The owner or occupant of each premises connected to the municipal waterworks and wastewater system for both water and wastewater disposal service whose average daily five-day twenty-degree Celsius BOD, of the wastewater discharged to the system exceeds two hundred twenty (220) mg/l or whose average daily TSS of the wastewater discharged to the system exceeds two hundred fifty (250) mg/l shall pay a user charge computed in subsection (b) above, plus a surcharge in accordance with the provisions of section 26-95. 
(d)  Class I, II or III users not connected to the municipal waterworks. In the event that any premises which discharges any such wastes into the wastewater disposal system is not connected to the municipal waterworks and therefore has no municipal water meter, or meter acceptable to the superintendent, the amount of water so used shall be otherwise determined by the superintendent in order to determine the wastewater user service charge as provided in this section; or the owner or other interested person at his expense shall install and maintain a meter acceptable to the superintendent for the purpose. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 1, 11-10-97; Ord. No. 795, § 1, 12-13-99) 
Sec. 26-97. - Payment of the user's wastewater service charge and penalties. 
    The wastewater service charge shall be due and billed at the same time as charges are made for consumers taking water from the municipal water system, and penalties for nonpayment thereof shall be added in the same manner as for water charges. Should any user fail to pay the wastewater user charge and penalty within stated due dates, the city may disconnect water service to such premises as provided in subsection 26-38(c). In the event of the discontinuance of such water service, the same shall not be resumed until payment of all past due water and wastewater service charges, including penalties thereon. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 1, 11-10-97) 
Sec. 26-98. - Review of each user's wastewater service charge. 
    The city shall review the total annual fixed, operation and maintenance costs as well as each user's wastewater classification and surcharges on a regular basis to assure equity of the service charge system established herein. If a class III user, such as an industry, has completed in plant modifications which would change that user's BOD, TSS contribution or any other significant chemical and physical characteristic percentages, the user can present at a regularly scheduled meeting of the city commission such factual information; and the city shall then determine if the user's BOD, TSS contribution or any other significant chemical and physical characteristic percentages are to be changed. The city shall notify the user of its findings as soon as possible. The owner or occupant of any commercial or nonresidential premises who by reason of special circumstances finds the foregoing user's wastewater service charges unjust or inequitable as applied to his premises may make written application to the city commission, stating such circumstances and requesting a different basis of charges for wastewater service to his premises, in which case the city commission shall investigate the circumstances and afford hearing to all interested parties and shall by resolution fix and establish fair and equitable service charges for such premises if the normal charges are found to be inequitable to the owner or occupant. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 1, 11-10-97)

(Ord. No. 864, § 8, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-129. - Responsibility. 
    The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this article are minimum standards; therefore, this article does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 9, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-130. - Discharge prohibitions. 
(a)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than storm water. The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(1)  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater de-watering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if de-chlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
(2)  Discharges specified in writing by the program administrator as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
(3)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test. 
(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
(b)  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(1)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. 
(2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 10, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-131. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The program administrator may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition in writing the city commission for a reconsideration and hearing. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 11, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-132. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the program administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 12, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-133. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm water discharges associated with industrial activity and construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. The program administrator shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
Facility operators shall allow the program administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
The program administrator shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge. 
The program administrator shall have the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the program administrator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
Unreasonable delays in allowing the program administrator access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
If the program administrator has been refused access to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 13, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-134. - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce storm water pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
    The City of Yankton requires best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or Waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a residential, commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 14, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-135. - Watercourse protection. 
    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other deleterious materials that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly degrade the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 15, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-136. - Notification of spills or releases. 
    Not withstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency responses for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or Waters of the U.S., said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Yankton Public Works Department within five (5) business days of the phone notice. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 16, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-137. - Enforcement; notice of violation. 
    Whenever the program administrator finds that an organization has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation: 
(1)  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
(2)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
(3)  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
(4)  The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
(5)  Payment of a fees to cover administrative and remediation costs; and

Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 17, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-138. - Appeal of notice of violation. 
    Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be in writing and received within five (5) days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the city commission shall take place within fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal or the next regularly scheduled city commission meeting, whichever comes first. The decision of the city commission shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 18, 3-14-05) 
Sec. 26-139. - Enforcement measures after appeal. 
    If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten (10) days of the decision of the city commission upholding the decision of the authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the City of Yankton may enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated agent to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.

(Ord. No. 956, § 1, 6-10-13) 
Sec. 27-72. - Purposes and intentions. 
(a)  The purposes for enacting this sign ordinance are varied. 
(b)  First, as part of its duty to manage the streets and public ways, the city must protect driver sight lines on public rights-of-way. Some signs may create a traffic hazard by confusing or distracting motorists by impairing the driver's ability to see pedestrians, obstacles or other vehicles. They may also interfere with a person's ability to see and interpret any official traffic sign, signal or device. 
(c)  Second, as a part of its police powers, the city must also protect against damage caused by a sign. A sign may present a danger to persons and property by way of collapse, fire, collision, decay or abandonment. 
(d)  Third, as a part of its police powers, the city has determined that this article should assist business owners who use signs to advertise their businesses. If there are too many signs in an area, then an existing business owner may have difficulty conveying a simple message(s) to customers. Customers may locate a business or service more readily with a sign. Signs also assist home owners because they identify residences and preserve the beauty of neighborhoods. A sign also assists a business because it permits customer identification of the business, product or service. 
(e)  Fourth, as a part of police powers, the city has determined that the city as a whole benefits when there is not a clutter of signs or signs that do not meet a basic level of maintenance and use. 
(f)  Fifth, unmaintenanced signs can be a location for dumping or gather dirt or paper, which may also create a fire hazard. Therefore, the city has an interest in public safety. 
(g)  Sixth, the content of some signs may be immoral, harmful to persons or businesses, or further illegal activity. As a result, in furtherance of the city's police powers, some content expression is punished, but only that which the United States Supreme Court has held to be categorically suppressible. 
(h)  Finally, some forms of media present adverse, unwanted consequences which may interfere with neighborhood privacy or solicitude or cause a fluctuation in the desirability of real estate and, in turn, the value of neighboring real estate. As a result, some forms of media are prohibited at all times. 
(i)  Signs are also important to the city because they identify government buildings and services. The city desires to equally treat the public. As a result, public property is not an appropriate location for any private sign. All signs on public property, which are not approved by or provided for approval by, the city commission, are prohibited. 
(j)  In order to provide for orderly implementation of these purposes, the city has enacted licensing and permit requirements. The license and permit requirements are inapplicable in certain limited instances. All signs which are not permitted herein are prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 956, § 2, 6-10-13) 
Sec. 27-73. - Sign contractor licensing. 
(a)  General rule. It shall be unlawful to erect a sign in the city without first obtaining a sign contractor license. Fees for such license shall be as determined from time to time by resolution of the city commission. Signs erected by an owner on their own premises are exempt from this section. The city commission may revoke any sign contractor license when the licensee has been found to have violated any provision of this chapter. Notification of listed violations must be given in writing to the licensee. A period of fifteen (15) days will be allowed from the date of notification for the licensee to make necessary corrections, after which the city commission may act to revoke the sign contractor's license. Situations where the public's health safety and welfare are in peril as described in the building code do not require a fifteen-day notification. 
(b)  Assignability. A sign contractor license is not assignable. 
(Ord. No. 956, § 3, 6-10-13) 
Sec. 27-74. - Sign permitting. 
(a)  General rule. In order to erect, to alter, or to relocate a sign an owner or licensed sign contractor must first obtain a sign permit from the city. A sign permit may authorize the erection of one (1) or more signs. 
(b)  Exceptions. The following signs do not require a permit but may be regulated by this chapter: 
(1)  A-frame, T-frame and sandwich board sign. 
(2)  Banner signs. 
(3)  Construction contractor's sign. 
(4)  Fan/booster sign. 
(5)  Flags. 
(6)  Identification signs. 
(7)  Incidental signs. 
(8)  Government signs. 
(9)  Gas pump topper sign. 
(10)  All signs excluded from the definition of "sign." 
(11)  Ordinary maintenance and repairs of any sign. 
(12)  Temporary signs. 
(c)  Term. A permit is valid as of the date of its issuance and for a total period of one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter. A permit shall be void if the work for which the permit was issued is not completed within said term. 
(d)  Application/permanent signs. All applications for a permanent sign, or the modification of an existing permanent sign, shall be accompanied with: 
(1)  A detailed site plan of the lot showing the exact location and orientation of the sign(s) relative to all lot lines, building lines, parking lots, drive-ways and other pertinent land and architectural features. 
(2)  An elevation drawing showing the total height of the sign above the adjacent grade. 
(3)  The total dimensions of the sign facing. 
(4)  The design features of the sign. 
(5)  The type of illumination or other characteristics of the sign. 
(6)  The size and type of existing signs on the property. 
(7)  All other applicable data, such as lot line dimensions and building wall or other surface areas dimensions as required by the city. 
(8)  The applicable fee, established by resolution of the city commission. 
(e)  Application/impermanent signs. All applications for an impermanent sign, or the modification of an existing impermanent sign, shall be accompanied with: 
(1)  A detailed site plan of the lot showing the exact location and orientation of the sign(s) relative to all lot lines. 
(2)  A drawing showing the total height and facing dimensions. 
(3)  The type of illumination or other characteristics of the sign. 
(4)  All other applicable data, such as lot line dimensions and building wall or other surface areas dimensions as required by the city. 
(5)  The applicable fee, established by resolution of the city commission. 
(f)  Assignability. All sign permits are assignable to a successor owner. 
(g)  Grandfather clause. Any lawfully existing sign which is made unlawful by the adoption of this chapter is exempt from this permit requirement, unless its use is changed, there has been a discontinuance, or it constitutes an "abandoned sign," all of which void the grandfather status. A temporary or impermanent sign shall not be considered "grandfathered" beyond the described time allowed herein. 
(1)  Change of use. A change of use occurs when the owner alters the sign in any manner, including changing to another nonconforming use, structural alteration intended to prolong the life of the sign, structural alteration of the shape, size, type or design, or alteration of the words or symbols on the message displayed (except when the sign is specifically designed for periodic change of message). 
(2)  Exception to change of use. A nonconforming sign may be maintenanced or repaired, unless the cost of the maintenance or repair exceeds forty (40) per cent of the initial cost of the sign. 
(3)  Discontinuance. Discontinuance occurs if the activity, business or usage to which the sign was used has been stopped for a period of thirty (30) days or longer. 
(Ord. No. 956, § 4, 6-10-13) 
Sec. 27-75. - Sign design, construction, illumination, height and maintenance. 
    All permanent signs shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  All permanent and impermanent signs must comply with the applicable provisions of the adopted building and electric codes at all times.

(3)  All signs shall be maintained in a safe and legible condition at all times, including the replacement of defective or damaged parts, painting, repainting, cleaning and other services required for maintenance of the signs. If a sign is not so maintained, then the owner shall be notified in writing and required to remove the sign or to immediately bring the sign into compliance. 
(4)  All signs with an electronic message display capability shall have internal ambient light monitors installed which automatically adjust brightness to the level defined in this chapter. 
(5)  Illuminated signs shall be so shielded, shaded or directed so that the light intensity shall not adversely affect the surrounding or facing premises nor adversely affect the safe vision of operators of vehicles on private or public roads. The illumination of electronic message signs shall not exceed a brightness level of 0.3 foot candles above ambient light. 
(6)  No sign shall exceed the maximum height of structures in the city zoning ordinance.
