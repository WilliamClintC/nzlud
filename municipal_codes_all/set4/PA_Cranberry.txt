as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the
adoption of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such
ordinances, resolutions and regulations and not as a new enactment.
The provisions of this Code shall not affect any suit or prosecution

§ 1-107. Normal Numbering. [Ord. 2005-362, 12/15/2005]
§ 1-108. Special Numbering Problems. [Ord. 2005-362, 12/15/2005]
not intend by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before
amending, revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may
have been included herein in the future. It is the intention of the Board
of Supervisors that such actions of the Board of Supervisors that may
be included in this Code and specifically cited and designated as a
resolution shall not become an ordinance (requiring prior public notice
before amendment, revision or repeal) by the simple fact of inclusion in
this Code.
1. Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout
this Code.
2. Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
3. Whenever other divisions are necessary, chapters shall be divided into

part number followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be
divided into Subchapters 1A and 1B.
4. Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a chapter and
a part such that the first number or numbers is the chapter number,
followed by a hyphen, followed by the part number, followed by the
section number within the part. For example, "§ 1-101" designates
Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1. Similarly, "§ 27-305" designates Chapter
27, Part 3, Section 5.
5. Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are

to introduce a new chapter, part or section between existing chapters,
parts or sections, the new chapter, part or section shall be designated
by the addition of a capital letter suffix to the preceding chapter, part or
section number. Thus, a chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6
§ 1-106 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1-108
1:5
§ 1-109. Amending Code.
would be Chapter 5A and sections in that chapter would be numbered,
for instance, "§ 5A-101." If it becomes necessary to introduce a part
between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new part would be Part 5A and
sections in that part would be numbered, for instance, "§ 5-5A01."
A new section introduced between existing Sections 5 and 6 would
be "§ 5-105A." When a number of new parts or sections have been
introduced the chapter or part shall be renumbered.
2. If it becomes necessary to introduce a subsection between subsections,
for instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new subsection would be
numbered Subsection .5-A.

between existing unites, the entire subsection shall be revised and
renumbered.
4. Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or
repeal, the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old
numbers until the overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision,
the vacated number may be marked: "(Reserved)."
1. All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which
amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for
inclusion herein. In the case of repealed chapters, parts, sections,
paragraphs, clauses or other part or provision hereof, by subsequent
ordinance, such repealed portions may be excluded from this Code by
omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent
ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal,
shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time as this Code and subsequent ordinances omitted are readopted as
a new Code by the Board of Supervisors.
2. Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific
reference to the chapter, part, section and/or subsection number of this
Code in the following language:
A. Amendment or Revision. "Chapter___, Part___, Section___,
Subsection___, is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . . ."
The amended or revised provisions may then be set out in full as
desired.

hereby amended by the addition of the following. . . ." The new

scheme of this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the
event that any ordinance or other enactment be adopted which does not
conform to the numbering system of this Code, it is the intention of the
Board of Supervisors that such enactment be renumbered in the
process of supplementing, revising or updating this Code to conform to
the numbering scheme of this Code. The Board of Supervisors hereby
acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for
ease of reference and that the renumbering of any enactment when
added to this Code shall not in any manner affect the validity of said
enactment.
1. Penalty Where No Penalty Provided. Whenever in this Code or in any
ordinance of the Township any act is prohibited or is declared to be
unlawful, or whenever in this Code or other ordinance the doing of any
act is declared to be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided
therefor:

of ordinances adopting building, housing, property maintenance,
health, fire or public safety codes; and for ordinances regulating
water services, water pollution, air pollution and noise, the
following penalty shall be provided:
(1) Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision
of this part, upon conviction thereof in an action brought
before a district judge in the manner provided for the
enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania
Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of
not more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of
said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90
days. Each day that a violation of this part continues or each
section of this part which shall be found to have been violated
shall constitute a separate offense.

Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.), penalties and ordinances adopted

violated or permitted the violation of any provision of this part,
upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement
proceeding commenced by the Township, shall pay a judgment
of not more than $600 plus all court costs. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of
the determination of a violation by a district judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure, at which time, in addition to any
penalties, the violator shall be liable for any attorney's fees and
costs incurred by the Township. Each day that a violation
continues or each section of this part which shall be found to
have been violated shall constitute a separate violation.
2. The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not
prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other
punitive or remedial action where called for or permitted under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of
America. In addition, the Township may institute injunctive, mandamus
or any other appropriate action or proceeding at law or in equity for the
enforcement of this Code. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall
have the right to issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent
injunctions, mandamus, or other appropriate forms of remedy or relief.

§ 8-402. Description of and Special Requirements for Identified
Floodplain Areas. [Ord. No. 2018-484, 8/23/2018]
1. The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of the Township of Cranberry classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated August
2, 2018, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Township of Cranberry
and declared to be a part of this chapter.
1. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and
the FIRM as Floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term
shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special
flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or
development shall be allowed unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
§ 8-401 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 8-402
1:85
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(2) The AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by
FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided but
no floodway has been determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted within any AE Zone without
floodway, and no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted, unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed development, together with all
other existing and anticipated development, would not
result in an increase in flood levels of more than one foot
within the entire community during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection's regional office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require
the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review
by the municipality. In the absence of any of the above data or
documentation, the community may require the elevation of the
lowest floor to be at least three feet above the highest adjacent
grade.
D. The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as
Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are

§ 8-403. Changes in Identification of Area. [Ord. No. 2018-484, 8/
23/2018]
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 8-501.2 for situations where
FEMA notification is required.
§ 8-404. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. No. 2018-484, 8/23/2018]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Township of Cranberry; and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Board
of Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 8-405. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes. [Ord. No. 2018-484, 8/
23/2018]
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding, where
average depths are between one and three feet. In Zones AO
and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters
around and away from structures on slopes.

A. No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
B. No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
C. In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
2. When the Township of Cranberry proposes to permit the following
encroachments: any development that causes a rise in the base flood
elevation within the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones
A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway which will cause a
rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or
relocation of a stream (including, but not limited to, installing culverts
and bridges):
A. The applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12) apply to FEMA for
conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the
encroachments to occur.
B. Upon receipt of the FEMA Administrator's conditional approval of
map change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject

Part 1
IMPACT FEES
§ 12-101. Title. [Ord. 2001-312, 3/29/2001; § 1]
This part shall be known as the "Cranberry Township Impact Fee Program."
§ 12-102. Purpose. [Ord. 2001-312, 3/29/2001, § 2]
The purpose of this part is to establish the Cranberry Township Impact Fee
Program, including a transportation capital improvements plan, to ensure
that the transportation system is available and adequate to support existing
volumes of traffic and traffic projected to be generated by new growth and
development. To advance this objective, the Cranberry Township Impact
Fee Program shall be based upon the imposition of an impact fee payable
to the Township at the time of building permit issuance. Additionally, the
program identifies existing deficiencies due to pass through trips and future
trip generation attributable to new development. The program will provide
a continuing generation of funds necessary for the Township to initiate
and complete capital transportation improvements as needed in support of
new growth and development. Such a program will involve participation
by developers as well as local, state and federal governments. Through
the Impact Fee Program, the Township is establishing a process whereby
future traffic needs can be addressed in a timely manner and the impact of
increased traffic volumes can be minimized to the extent possible.
§ 12-103. Findings. [Ord. 2001-312, 3/29/2001, § 3]
The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that:
A. The Township is committed to the provision of a transportation system
at service levels necessary to support residential and nonresidential
growth and development.
B. Transportation service levels will be provided by the Township utilizing
funds allocated via the capital budget, capital improvements programs
and impact fees.
C. The aggregation of development in the defined Transportation Service
Areas intensifies the demand for transportation improvements designed
to accommodate traffic volumes at a "d" level of service as defined by
the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Science,
which is the minimum acceptable level of service to accommodate such
development and the intensity thereof.
D. The development potential of properties in the defined transportation
service areas is reflected in the most recently adopted roadway
sufficiency analysis and the Township's Comprehensive Plan and is
implemented via the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
[Chapter 22] and Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27]. [Amended by Ord.

Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., and as amended from
time to time.[Amended by Ord. 2011-421, 11/3/2011, § 3]
E. To the extent that new development in the transportation service areas
places demands upon the transportation system, those demands should
be satisfied by the establishment of an impact fee program that
distributes the responsibility for financing the provision of such
transportation facilities among the Township, State and Federal
governments, and developers.
F. The amount of the impact fee to be imposed shall be calculated in
accordance with the provisions of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53
P.S. § 10501-A et seq., as amended and this part, applying the
engineering standards set forth in the most recent edition of Trip
Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineering,
and any amendments or future editions thereof. [Amended by Ord.
2011-421, 11/3/2011, § 2]
G. The Township hereby finds and declares that an impact fee imposed
upon new development, in order to assist in the financing of specified
major transportation capital improvements in the defined
transportation service areas, the demand for which has been quantified
through the application of land use assumptions provided by the Impact
Fee Advisory Committee appointed by the Board of Supervisors, is in
the best interest of the Township and its residents.

3. If the development for which a building permit is sought contains a mix
of uses, the applicant must separately calculate the impact fee due for
each type of development.
1. Applicability. An additional impact fee shall be imposed upon new
developments that generate 1,000 or more p.m. peak hour trips, net of
pass-by trips as defined by the most recent edition of Trip Generation
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and any
amendments or future editions thereof. This section is in addition to the
impact fee calculated under this part. [Amended by Ord. 2011-421,
11/3/2011, § 5]
2. Traffic Study. An applicant for a new development that generates 1,000
or more p.m. peak hour trips shall be required to perform a traffic
analysis of development traffic impact on highways, roads or streets
outside the transportation service area in which the new development
is located, but within the boundaries of the Township. Any highways,
roads or streets or parts thereof, outside the transportation service
area that will accommodate 10% or more of the new development
traffic and 100 or more new p.m. peak hour trips may be required to be
studied. The traffic study is to be conducted in accordance with the
Township requirements as determined by the Township Traffic
Engineer.
3. Mitigation. Applicants for new development that generate 1,000 or
more new p.m. peak hour trips, less pass by trips will be required to
mitigate the traffic impact of the new development on the affected
roads, highways and streets per the traffic study to maintain the predevelopment
conditions.
1. Applicability of this Section. The Board of Supervisors may permit or
require a new development to perform a special transportation study to
document actual trip generation from a particular use. The instances
when a special transportation study can or must be performed are
limited to instances where:
A. The Township requests a special transportation study.

C. The use is not represented in any amendments or future editions of
Trip Generation published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers.
[Amended by Ord. 2011-421, 11/3/2011, § 7]
D. A new development, after no more than 18 months from the date of
payment of an impact fee and being fully occupied and operational,
chooses to challenge the amount of the impact fee.
2. Guidelines for Conducting a Special Transportation Study. Special
transportation studies must be conducted in accordance with the
guidance in the most recent version of Trip Generation published by the
Institute of Traffic Engineers. The new development is responsible for
all costs associated with the special transportation study. [Amended by
Ord. 2011-421, 11/3/2011, § 8]
3. Adjustments. Requests for adjustments of an Impact fee as a result of a
special transportation study conducted under Subsection 1.D must be
in writing directed to the Township Manager and must be postmarked
within 18 months of the date of the check paying the impact fee. No
adjustments will exceed the amount of the impact fee actually paid.
1. Collection of Impact Fee. Impact fees due pursuant to this part shall be
collected by the Township in the manner prescribed herein prior to
issuance of a building permit.
2. Establishment and Maintenance of Accounts. The Director of Finance
shall establish interest-bearing trust fund accounts created solely for
impact fees and shall maintain records whereby impact fees collected
are segregated by transportation service areas. All interest earned shall
become the funds of that account. Impact fees generated from new
development may only be expended for transportation capital
improvements identified as being funded by impact fees under the
transportation capital improvements plan in a particular transportation
service area, except as provided in § 12-113.
3. Maintenance of Records. The Director of Finance shall maintain and
keep adequate financial records for each such account that will show
the source and disbursement of all revenues, that will account for all
moneys received and that shall ensure that the disbursement of funds
from each account will be used solely and exclusively for the provision
of projects specified in the transportation capital improvements plan for
the particular transportation service area.

contained in the adopted Transportation Capital Improvements Plan if all of
the following criteria are met:
§ 12-114. Method of Payment. [Ord. 2001-312, 3/29/2001, § 14]
Payment of the impact fee shall be made by the new development prior to
the issuance of a building permit by the Township to the new development
for development on the applicable site.
§ 12-115. Credit. [Ord. 2001-312, 3/29/2001, § 15; as amended by
Ord. 2011-421, 11/3/2011, § 9]
C. Unavoidable delays in construction of capital improvements

E. Changes in the estimated costs of the transportation improvements
proposed which may be recalculated by applying the construction
cost index as published in the American City/County Magazine or
the Engineering News Record.
F. Significant changes in the projected revenue from sources listed.
A. The applicant has provided written consent to use of its collected
impact fees for specific transportation projects which are not included
in the Transportation Capital Improvement plan.
B. The alternative transportation project, whether highway or multimodal,
has as its purpose the reduction of traffic congestion or the
removal of vehicle trips from the roadway network.
C. The Township amends its transportation capital improvements plan
components required by § 504-A(e)(1)(vi) of the Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10504-A(e)(1)(vi), to provide replacement of the
collected impact fees transferred to transportation projects outside the
approved transportation capital improvements plan from sources other
than impact fees or developer contributions within three years of
completion of the alternative projects to which the transferred fees
were applied.
1. A developer is entitled to a credit against the impact fee in the amount
of the fair market value of any land dedicated by the applicant to the
Township for future right-of-way, realignment or widening of any
existing roadways or for the value of any construction of road
improvements which are performed at the applicants expense and are
§ 12-112 CRANBERRY CODE § 12-115
1:126
contained in the transportation capital improvement plan. The amount
of such credit for any capital improvement constructed shall be the
amount allocated in the capital improvement program, including
contingency factors for such work. The fair market value of any land
dedicated by the applicant shall be determined as of the date of the
submission of the land development or subdivision application to the
Township.
2. Any new development which performs, at its own expense, off-site
improvements as defined by this part, shall be eligible for a credit
toward the impact fee otherwise due in the amount of the actual cost of
such off-site improvements as approved by the Township Engineer.
Such credit shall not exceed the amount of the impact fee. In order for a
new development to be eligible for this credit it must announce the
intent to perform off-site improvements during the subdivision or land
development approval process. The announcement must be in writing
and must set forth the off-site improvement project for which the
developer is seeking credit. The developer must enter into an
agreement with the Township prior to the issuance of any building
permit. The agreement must establish the estimated cost of the
improvement, the schedule for initiation and completion of the
improvement, guarantee that the improvement be completed to
Township and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards
and design criteria, and such other terms and conditions as deemed
necessary by the Township. The Township must review the
improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules, determine if the
improvement is an eligible improvement and determine the amount of
the applicable credit for such improvement to be applied to the
otherwise applicable impact fee prior to issuance of any building
permit. In no event may the Township provide a credit that is greater
than the applicable impact fee. If, however, the amount of the credit is
calculated to be greater than the amount of the impact fee due, the new
development may utilize such excess credit toward the impact fees
imposed on other building permits for development on the same site
and in the same ownership.
3. The Township may provide a credit against impact fees for the value of
any construction projects that are not contained in the adopted
transportation capital improvements plan which are performed at the
developer's expense, if all of the following conditions are met:
A. The applicant has provided written consent to a credit of its
collected impact fees for specific transportation projects which are
not included in the transportation capital improvements plan.
B. The alternative transportation project, whether highway or multimodal,
has as its purpose the reduction of traffic congestion or the
removal of vehicle trips from the roadway network.
C. The Township amends its transportation capital improvements plan
components required by § 504-A(e)(1)(vi) of the Municipalities
§ 12-115 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 12-115
1:127
§ 12-116. Refunds. [Ord. 2001-312, 3/29/2001, § 16]
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10504-A(e)(1)(vi), to provide replacement
of the credited impact fees transferred to transportation projects
outside the approved Transportation Capital Improvements Plan
from sources other than impact fees or developer contributions
within three years of completion of the alternative projects to
which the transferred fees were applied.
1. The payer of the impact fee may apply for a refund of appropriate share
of any such fee and any interest earned from the date of payment if:
A. The Township has failed to commence any transportation service
area road improvements within three years of the scheduled
construction date set forth in the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan.
B. The new development for which impact fees were paid is not
commenced prior to the expiration of a building permit issued for
the new development within the time limits established by
applicable building codes; or the project for which a building
permit has been issued has been altered resulting in a decrease in
the amount of the impact fee due.
C. If upon completion of any road improvements project the actual
expenditures are less than 95% of the costs allocable to the fee paid
within the transportation service area in which the road
improvement was adopted, the Township shall refund to the payer
the pro rata difference between the budgeted costs and the actual
expenditures, including interest from the date of payment.
D. In the event that the Township terminates or completes an adopted
capital improvements plan for a transportation service area and
there remains at the time of termination or completion undispersed
funds in the accounts established for that purpose, the Township
shall provide written notice by certified mail to those persons who
previously paid the fees which remain undispersed of the
availability of said funds for refund of the person's proportionate
share of the fund balance. The allocation of the refund shall be
determined by generally accepted accounting practices. In the
event that any of the funds remain unclaimed following one year
after the notice, which shall be provided to the last known address
provided by the payer of the fees to the Township, the Township
shall be authorized to transfer any funds so remaining to any other
fund in the Township without any further obligation to refund said
funds.
2. The request for refund must be submitted to the Township Manager in
writing specifying the details and basis for the request for refund.

LICENSES, PERMITS AND GENERAL BUSINESS
REGULATIONS
§ 12-118 CRANBERRY CODE § 12-118
1:130
Part 1
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYEES
§ 13-101. Purpose and Findings. [Ord. 96-270, 7/25/1996]
1. Purpose.
A. Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township
Code to prohibit nuisances; to promote the health, cleanliness,
comfort and safety of the citizens of Cranberry Township; and to
regulate the time of opening and closing, and the conduct of places
of public entertainment, amusement and recreation, the Township
of Cranberry enacts this part to minimize and control the adverse
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby
protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; protect the
citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve
the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods;
and deter the spread of blight.
B. The Board of Supervisors has determined that locational criteria
alone do not adequately protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the people of the Township, and that licensing is a
legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to insure that
operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable
regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
C. The Board of Supervisors does not intend this part to suppress any
speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a
content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses.
2. Legislative Findings.
A. Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects,
which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public
health, safety and welfare. These secondary effects include, but are
not limited to, the spread of communicable diseases, performance
of sexual acts in public places, presence of discarded sexually
oriented materials on public and private property, sexual
harassment, obscenity, prostitution and other illegal sexual
activities, crime and neighborhood deterioration.
B. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in
a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Township. It is
§ 13-101 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 13-101
1:131
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee
is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
C. Removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in discouraging the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
D. Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incident of certain types of criminal
behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or
suspects and by preventing minors from working in such
establishments.
E. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, limiting the adverse secondary effects
of such businesses.
F. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this part
is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such
activity.
G. The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in
contravention of this part.
H. The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to
and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
I. The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the
Township will be promoted by the enactment of this part.
J. Limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to
10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays, and closure
of such businesses on Sundays and holidays reduces the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses, including particularly, but not
limited to, late night noise levels, crime and sexually offensive
materials and activities in public areas, and promotes the public
health, safety and welfare.

shall include the plural, and the plural the singular. The word "person"
includes a corporation and unincorporated association.
2. As used in this part, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:
ALARM  a communication to the police, fire, or emergency medical
service departments indicating that a crime, fire, or other emergency
situation warranting immediate action by the police, fire, or emergency
medical service departments has occurred or is occurring.
ALARM AGENT  any firm, corporation or person who conducts the
business of owning, operating, maintaining, installing, leasing, or

or premises any automatic protection device, as defined in this part,
within Cranberry Township.
ALARM SYSTEM  any electrically operated instrument composed
of sensors and related hardware that automatically signals by wire,
telephone, radio signal, or other means to a person who, in turn,
notifies the Butler County Communications Center of the alarm. Alarm
systems also include equipment to activate a bell or sounding device
to be heard outside a building which is intended to alert the police or
others to the existence of a crime, fire, or other emergency situation
warranting action by emergency services, upon receipt of a stimulus
from a sensor that has detected a physical force or condition
characteristic of a fire, intrusion, or other emergency.
AUDIBLE ALARM  any device, bell, horn, or siren which is attached to
the interior or exterior of a building and emits a warning signal audible
outside the building, which signal is designed to attract attention when
activated by an intrusion or other emergency requiring police or service
response.

1:153
§ 13-303. Operational Standards. [Ord. 97-286, 12/4/1997, § 40.3]
CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM  any protective system or group of
systems operated privately for customers by an alarm agent; a firm; or

a central station having operators in attendance at all times who have
the duty to take appropriate action upon receipt of a signal or message,
including the relaying of messages by designated or direct trunk line to
the Butler County Communications Center.
FALSE ALARM  an alarm to which police, fire, or other emergency
service personnel respond resulting from the activation of an alarm
device when a crime, fire, or other emergency warranting immediate
action has not in fact occurred.
INADVERTENT FALSE ALARM  an alarm system activated in the
absence of an emergency, whether by inadvertence, negligence, or
unintentional act, including any mechanical or electrical malfunction of
the alarm system, to which a public safety person actually responds.
INTENTIONAL FALSE ALARM  a false alarm resulting from the
intentional activation of an alarm device by an individual under
circumstances where that individual has no reasonable basis to believe
that a crime, fire, or other emergency warranting immediate action has
occurred or is occurring.
SILENT ALARM  a protective system that does not emit an audible
signal or tone when activated at a protected site and is monitored by a
central station system.
1. Audible alarms, other than fire alarms, must be equipped with a timing
mechanism which will disengage the audible alarm after a maximum
period of 10 minutes if the system activates on or near the premises.
Exceptions shall be made for certified systems requiring longer
sounding alarms for insurance purposes, providing that certification
and policy requirements are documented with the Township, and
further providing that these devices are equipped with timers to
disengage the audible alarm after the minimum time required for
certification.
2. The sensory mechanism used in conjunction with an alarm device must
be adjusted to suppress false indications of fire or intrusion, so that the
alarm device will not be activated by impulses due to transient pressure
changes in water lines, short flashes of light, wind effects such as
rattling or vibration of doors or windows, vehicular noises adjacent to
the premises, or other forces unrelated to genuine alarm situations.
3. The alarm device must be maintained in good repair to assure reliable
operation.
4. No person shall conduct or test any alarm device without first notifying
the alarm agent to ensure that the alarm or signal is not relayed to the
Butler County Communications Center.

1. The Township Manager shall develop and implement the necessary
procedures for the effective administration and enforcement of this
part.
A. The Director of Public Safety shall ensure that a report is submitted
for each alarm activation requiring public safety response.

Township's ordinance.
2. False Alarms.
A. The principal owner, operator, tenant, or other individual
responsible for the facility from which a false alarm emanated shall
pay to the Township a charge for each and every false alarm to

service respond, in each calendar year, as specified in the fee
resolution.
B. The charges imposed by this part in conjunction with the fee
schedule shall not apply in the following circumstances.
(1) The false alarm is due to weather conditions.
(2) For new installations, documentation has been provided that
the alarm system was initially installed within six months prior
to the false alarm, no more that three false alarms have
occurred since the installation, and the false alarm is due to a
system malfunction.
(3) For installations more than six months old, the false alarm is
the first reported at the subject address during the calendar
year.
(4) An event occurred on the alarmed premises that could not have
been anticipated, and the alarm system detected the
occurrence. Examples might be a ceiling tile falling, a water
pipe bursting, or a repairman causing an inadvertent false
alarm. Leaving a pet loose or a fan on in a room protected by
motion detection would not be events that would be excused.
(5) Multiple alarms emanating from an alarmed facility in a
twelve-hour period shall be treated as a single alarm.
C. When a false alarm occurs, the Cranberry Township Director of
Finance shall notify the principal owner, operator, tenant, or other
individual responsible for the alarm system from which the false
alarm emanated that a false alarm charge is due and the amount

system of the alarmed facility demanding payment within 30 days.
If payment is still not made, a law enforcement officer will file a
citation with the district judge.
F. Failure of a person responsible for the alarm system that originated

Design Standards, of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance [Chapter 22] and to complement the Storm Water
Management Act, P.L. 864, No. 167, 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq. Said
Act requires that actions be taken:
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:233
(a) To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is
no greater after development than prior to development
activities.
(b) To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise
adequately protects health and property from possible
injury.

drainage systems and to preserve the flood-carrying
capacity of streams; to maintain existing flows and quality
of streams and watercourses.
(e) To encourage natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve
groundwater supplies and streamflows.
1) Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of
runoff through seepage beds, infiltration trenches,
etc., are encouraged, where soil conditions and
geology permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the
need for detention facilities.
2) Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the
site, made as shallow as practicable, and located to
maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features
while still meeting the other requirements of this Part.
(f) To implement an illegal discharge detection and
elimination program to address non-stormwater
discharges into the Township's separate storm sewer
system.

Pa. Code, Chapter 102. When there is a question whether
wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility of the
applicant or his agent to show that the land in question cannot
be classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to work in the
area must be obtained from PADEP. The applicant shall meet
requirements as contained in 25 Pa. Code, Chapters 92 and
102, as required and applicable as follows:
(a) The implementation and maintenance of erosion and
sediment control BMPs.
(b) Development of written plans.
(c) Submission of plans for approval.

exist to safely transport the concentrated discharge, or
otherwise prove that no erosion, sedimentation, flooding,
or other harm will result from the concentrated discharge.
1) The applicant must provide an easement for proposed
concentrated flow across adjacent properties to a
drainageway or public right-of-way.
2) Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the
requirements of this Part.

B. Stormwater Management Standards. [Amended by Ord.
2014-440, 1/30/2014]
(1) Design Storms. Stormwater management facilities on all
development sites shall control the peak stormwater discharge
for the one- , two- , ten- , twenty-five- , fifty- , and one-hundredyear
design storms. SCS twenty-four-hour, Type II rainfall
distribution shall be used in conjunction with rainfall depths
from NOAA Atlas 14 for analyzing stormwater runoff in preand
post-development conditions, as well as for designing
runoff control facilities, except as noted in § 17-350.7B(2)(b).
The rainfall data to be used for SCS TR-55 computations in
Cranberry Township are:
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:236
Design Storm Return Period
24-Hour Rainfall Depth
(inches)
1-year 2.02
2-year 2.41
10-year 3.38
25-year 4.00
50-year 4.50
100-year 5.03
All calculations shall be consistent with guidelines set forth
in the BMP Manual. The Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-
Frequency Curves, Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest
edition, shall be used in conjunction with the appropriate time
of concentration and return period to determine the rainfall
intensity in inches per hour. (For additional information or
data on other return periods, consult the Rainfall Duration
Frequency Tables for Pennsylvania, produced by PADEP,
Office of Resource Management, Bureau of Dams and
Waterways Management, Division of Stormwater
Management, Harrisburg, February 1983, or in its most
recent update.)
(2) Calculation Methods.
(a) Development Sites. For the purposes of computing peak
flow rates, runoff hydrographs, and storage requirements
for development sites, either the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff
Method as presented in the most recent version of
Technical Release 55 (TR-55) shall be used, or the Rational
Method as specified in § 17-350.7B(1). When the Rational
Method is used, the technical data in Appendix 17-A24 shall
be used to determine rainfall intensities, time of
concentration, and runoff coefficients. The use of
alternative hydrologic methodologies may be approved by
the Township if sufficient justification and documentation
of their application is provided.
1) The Rational Method shall not be used to calculate
runoff volume.
1.1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design
of conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should
be used by the design professional if the watershed
has more than one main drainage channel, if the
watershed is divided so that hydrologic properties are
24.Editor's Note: Appendix 17-A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:237
significantly different in one portion versus the other,
if the time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes or if
stormwater runoff volume is an important factor. The
combination of Rational Method hydrographs based
on timing shall be prohibited.
2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be
used to estimate the change in volume due to
regulated activities. Combining curve numbers for
land areas proposed for development with curve
numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is
not acceptable.
3) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method is
recommended for design of stormwater management
facilities and where stormwater runoff volume must
be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
a) NRCS's TR-55: limited to 100 acres in size.
b) NRCS's TR-20, WinTR-20, WinTR-55, HEC-HMS:
no watershed size limitations.
c) The NRCS antecedent runoff condition II (ARC II,
previously AMC II) must be used for all
simulations. The use of continuous simulation
models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
d) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be
rounded to a tenth of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
4) The time of concentration is to represent the average
condition that best reflects the hydrologic response of
the area. The following time of concentration (Tc)
computational methodologies shall be used unless
another method is preapproved by the Township
Engineer:
a) Predevelopment  NRCS's Lag Equation:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6) * 60]
(minutes)
Where
Tlag = Lag time (hours).
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet).
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:238
Y = Average overland slope of watershed
(percent).
S = Maximum retention in watershed as
defined by: S = [(1,000/CN)  10].
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed.
b) Post-development; commercial, industrial, or
other areas with large impervious areas (greater
than 20% impervious area): NRCS Segmental
Method. The length of sheet flow shall be limited
to 100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be
computed using Manning's equation.
c) Post-development; residential, cluster, or other
low-impact designs less than or equal to 20%
impervious area: NRCS Lag Equation or NRCS
Segmental Method.
5) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to
calculations for time of concentration:
a) The post-development Tc shall never be greater
than the predevelopment Tc for any watershed or
subwatershed. This includes when the designer
has specifically used swales to reduce flow
velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the post-development Tc is greater, it will still
be set by default equal to the predevelopment Tc
for modeling purposes.
b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five
minutes.
c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute
Tc for any post-development watershed or
subwatershed without providing any
computations.
d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc cannot
be assumed for predevelopment.
e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not
tributary to a stormwater facility but where a
reasonable effort has been made to convey runoff
from all new impervious coverage to best
management practices) may be assumed to
represent the predevelopment conditions for
purpose of Tc calculation.
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:239
6) In addition to § 17-350.7.B(2)(a) and (b), stormwater
runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as
defined below. For regulated activity areas equal to or
less than one acre that do not require hydrologic
routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Part
establishes no preference for either method;
therefore, the applicant may select either method on
the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
limitations on applicability of the analytical
procedures associated with each methodology, and
other factors.
a) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP
Manual) is applicable to any sized regulated
activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions.
i. Do not increase the post-development total
runoff volume when compared to the
predevelopment total runoff volume for the
two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
ii. For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[A] Existing nonforested pervious areas
must be considered meadow (good
condition) for predevelopment
hydrologic calculations.
[B] Twenty percent of existing impervious
area, when present within the
proposed project site, shall be
considered meadow (good condition)
for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
b) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual)
is independent of site conditions and should be
used if the Design Storm Method is not followed.
This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects
that require detailed design of stormwater
storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
i. Stormwater facilities shall capture at least
the first two inches of runoff from all new
impervious surfaces.
ii. At least the first one inch of runoff from new
impervious surfaces shall be permanently
removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:240
be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration.
iii. Wherever possible, infiltration facilities
should be designed to accommodate
infiltration of the entire permanently
removed runoff; however, in all cases at least
the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed
runoff should be infiltrated.
iv. Actual field infiltration tests at the location of
the proposed elevation of the stormwater
BMPs are required. Infiltration tests shall be
conducted in accordance with the BMP
Manual. Notification of the Township shall be
provided to allow witnessing of the testing.
c) In cases where it is not possible or desirable to
use infiltration-based best management practices
to partially fulfill the requirements in either
§ 17-350, Subsection 7B(2)(a)6)a) or b), the
following procedure shall be used:
i. At a minimum, the following documentation
shall be provided to justify the decision to not
use infiltration BMPs:
[A] Description of and justification for field
infiltration/permeability testing with
respect to the type of test and test
locations.
[B] An interpretive narrative describing
existing site soils and their structure as
these relate to the interaction between
soils and water occurring on the site.
In addition to providing soil and soil
profile descriptions, this narrative shall
identify depth to seasonal high water
tables and depth to bedrock, and
provide a description of all subsurface
elements (fragipans and other
restrictive layers, geology, etc.) that
influence the direction and rate of
subsurface water movement.
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:241
[C] A qualitative assessment of the site's
contribution to annual aquifer recharge
shall be made, along with identification
of any restrictions or limitations
associated with the use of engineered
infiltration facilities.
[D] The provided documentation must be
signed and sealed by a professional
engineer or geologist.
ii. The following water quality pollutant load
reductions will be required for all disturbed
areas within the proposed development:
Pollutant Load Units
Required
reduction
Total suspended
solids (TSS)
Pounds 85%
Total phosphorous
(TP)
Pounds 85%
Total nitrate (NO3) Pounds 50%
iii. The performance criteria for water quality
best management practices shall be
determined from the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual, most current version.
7) The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual
must be used in calculations to establish volume
control.
(b) Stormwater Collection/Conveyance Facilities. For the
purpose of designing storm sewers, open swales and other
stormwater runoff collection and conveyance facilities, the
Rational Method shall be utilized employing the technical
data referenced in § 17-350.7B(2)(a). The design storm for
storm sewers and swales that will discharge to detention
facilities is the one-hundred-year storm. The ten-year
design storm for storm systems discharging to detention
facilities shall be acceptable, provided that it can be
documented that runoff exceeding the ten-year capacity of
the storm system during a one-hundred-year storm event
will ultimately discharge to the detention facility by
alternative means, without endangering public safety or
damaging private property. The design storm for all other
on-site storm sewers or swales is the ten-year storm event,
provided that larger storm events will not impact private
property.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:242
1) All stormwater collection and/or conveyance systems
routing water through or around the development site
shall be designed for the one-hundred-year storm
event, unless it can be documented that said facilities
will not create a hazard.
2) A drainage easement shall be provided to contain and
convey the one-hundred-year flood event throughout
the project site, beginning at the furthest upstream
property line of the proposed development in the
watershed. Where watercourses traverse a
development site, drainage easements (with a
minimum width of 20 feet and including the onehundred-
year water surface) shall be provided
conforming to the line of such watercourses. The
terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any
portion of the easement. Also, maintenance, including
mowing of vegetation within the easement, may be
required, except as approved by the appropriate
governing authority.
3) The Rational Method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should be
used by the design professional if the watershed has
more than one main drainage channel, if the
watershed is divided so that hydrologic properties are
significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if
stormwater runoff volume is an important factor. The
combination of Rational Method hydrographs based
on timing shall be prohibited.
4) All structures (culverts or bridges) proposed to convey
runoff under a Township road shall be designed to
pass the fifty-year design storm with a minimum one
foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point
along the top of the roadway.
(c) Stormwater Management Facilities. Peak runoff rates for
all on-site areas and off-site areas impacting the project
site shall be determined and considered in the design of
stormwater management facilities. These calculations
shall be based on land use, time of concentration and other
standard hydrologic parameters as noted in
§ 17-350.7B(2)(a).
(d) All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set
forth in the BMP Manual, as amended herein.
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:243
(e) Impervious Areas:
1) The measurement of impervious areas shall include all
of the impervious areas in the total proposed
development, even if development is to take place in
stages.
2) For developments taking place in stages, the entire
development plan must be used in determining
conformance with this Part.
(3) Cranberry Township HEC-1 Watershed Model. All proposed
subdivision and land developments employing stormwater
management facilities designed to control five acres or more of
watershed area, or less at the Township's discretion, shall be
analyzed by the Township with the Cranberry Township HEC-1
Watershed Model. The resulting impacts in downstream areas
associated with the watershed modeling shall be the
determining factor for approval of proposed stormwater
management plans.
(4) Performance Standards.
(a) Where, in the judgment of the Township, the additional
volume or peak flow of stormwater runoff associated with
a proposed development site will have a detrimental
impact on downstream properties or drainage structures
and/or on existing documented downstream flooding
concerns, post-development peak flows may be required to
be reduced to less than otherwise determined site
allowable release rates [§ 17-350.7B(4)(e)]. Under these
circumstances, acceptable peak flow rates will be
determined at the discretion of the Township for a given
storm event(s) based on existing downstream restrictions.
Additional hydrologic studies or analyses may also be
required. Alternative mitigation measures in lieu of
increased peak flow reduction may be considered by the
Township on a case-by-case basis.
(b) Release Rate Percentage (RR%).
1) The release rate percentage defines the percentage of
the predevelopment peak rate of runoff that can be
discharged from the site following development as
determined in the Cranberry Township Stormwater
Management Plan. As per the plan, the Township shall
be divided into three separate watersheds as noted
below.
a) Brush Creek Watershed.
b) Wolfe Run Watershed.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:244
c) Kaufman Run Watershed.
2) These watersheds are further subdivided into
subwatersheds of similar hydrologic characteristics
upon which release rate percentages for each
subwatershed are determined. All subdivisions and
land developments located in these subwatersheds
that result in an increase in site runoff following
development shall use the release rate percentages
designated on the Release Rate Percentage Map in
Appendix 17-C25 as a guideline to determine allowable
release rates [§ 17-350.7.B(4)(e)] for the development
site.
(c) The following sites may be exempted from the designated
release rate percentage upon approval by the Township.
1) Development sites comprising three acres or less
located in a subwatershed with a designated release
rate percentage of less than 100% shall employ a
release rate of 100% to determine the site's allowable
release rate, provided that conditions cited in
§ 17-350.7B(4)(a), are not evident in downstream
areas.
2) Development sites where application of the
designated release rate percentage may induce
significant economic or site layout constraints may
request a modification of the designated release rate
percentage. Under these circumstances, the
developer shall submit a proposed stormwater
management plan with sufficient detail for the
Township to evaluate the impact of the development
with the Township HEC-1 Watershed Model
[§ 17-350.7B(3)]. The Township shall approve or
disapprove the proposed plan based on the resulting
impacts in downstream areas indicated by the
watershed model. Based on the watershed analysis,
the following procedures shall be followed at the
discretion of the Township.
a) The developer shall submit a revised stormwater
management plan reducing peak flow rates to a
level acceptable to the Township on the basis of
the evaluation with the Township HEC-1
Watershed Model. With the exception of
provisions noted in § 17-350.7B(4)(a), the
maximum reduction that may be imposed on a site
is the designated release rate percentage as per
25.Editor's Note: Appendix 17-C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:245
the Release Rate Percentage Map (Appendix
17-C).26
b) The Township may approve the developer's plan,
provided that the Township HEC-1 Watershed
Model shows minimal impact at any point
downstream that may result from runoff
associated with the proposed development site.
This approval shall be evaluated by the Township
on the basis of numerous factors, including
watershed location, erosional concerns and
provisions cited in § 17-350.7B(4)(a).
(d) Predevelopment Conditions. The cover type(s) for all sites
shall be consistent with site conditions based on aerial
photography of the Township dated May 27, 1999, and
employed in the watershed models developed for the
Cranberry Township Stormwater Management Plan. These
cover types shall be field verified, and the runoff curve
numbers (RCN) presented in Table 1 shall be used to
determine predevelopment peak flow rates when
employing the SCS TR-55 Soil Complex Methodology.
1) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate
and volume determination, existing nonforested
pervious areas conditions shall be considered as
meadow (good condition).
2) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate
and volume determination, 20% of existing impervious
area, when present, shall be considered meadow
(good condition).

3) The runoff coefficients (c) to be employed with the
Rational Formula for these cover types shall be
consistent with the table provided in Appendix
17-A.27All hydrologic parameters used to calculate
peak flow rates shall use the appropriate coefficients
26.Editor's Note: Appendix 17-C is included at the end of this chapter.
27.Editor's Note: Appendix 17-A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:246
pertaining to these conditions as noted in
§ 17-350.7B(2)(a).
(e) Allowable Release Rates. The allowable release rates from
stormwater management facilities, or a development site
in general, shall be less than or equal to the
predevelopment peak runoff rates generated for the site.
All stormwater runoff discharged from the site that is not
controlled by a stormwater management facility shall be
accounted for in the determination of the allowable release
rates for the full range of storm events. The allowable
release rate (RR) for a site as per § 17-350.7B(4)(b), shall
be determined by the following equation for each design
storm event:
Predevelopment Peak Flow Rate x RR%/100 = Allowable
RR
(f) Post-Development Conditions. The hydrologic parameters
used to develop peak flow rates shall be reflective of
anticipated soil runoff characteristics following grading
operations of the site, with areas disturbed by heavy
machinery associated with topsoil stripping, excavation
and engineered fill modeled as meadow (good condition)
with Hydrologic Soil Group D characteristics as per Table
1 of § 17-350.7B(4)(d).
(g) Redevelopment Sites. Existing sites proposed for
redevelopment that currently provide no stormwater
management, and/or sites that will remove existing or
inadequate stormwater management facilities, shall
provide stormwater management as per § 17-350.7B. For
the purposes of determining predevelopment peak flow
rates, the developed site shall be considered as meadow
(good condition) with Hydrologic Soil Group D
characteristics as per Table 1 of § 17-350.7B(4)(d), or a
weighted runoff coefficient of existing cover types should
that yield lower coefficient values.
(5) The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP
Manual, as may be amended from time to time, said
amendments incorporated herein by reference, and in the
Operation and Maintenance Agreement, in form and substance
approved by the Township Solicitor and the Board of
Supervisors, of Chapter 17 shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
(6) Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in
areas underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features
shall be excluded from the modeled point of analysis defining
predevelopment flows. If left undisturbed during construction
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:247
activities, areas draining to closed depressions may also be
used to reduce peak runoff rates in the post-development
analysis. New, additional contributing runoff should not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
(7) Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's equation
shall be used for hydraulic computations and to determine the
capacity of open channels, pipes, and storm sewers. The
Manning's equation should not be used for analysis of pipes
under pressure flow or for analysis of culverts. Manning's "n"
values shall be obtained from PennDOT's Drainage Manual,
Publication 584. Inlet control shall be checked at all inlet boxes
to ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design
event is contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
(8) The Township has the authority to require that computed
existing runoff rates be reconciled with field observations,
conditions and site history. If the designer can substantiate,
through actual physical calibration, that more appropriate
runoff and time of concentration values should be utilized at a
particular site, then appropriate variations may be made upon
review and recommendation of the Township.
C. Stormwater Management Plan.
(1) General Requirements.
(a) No final subdivision or land development plan shall be
approved, no permit authorizing construction issued, or
any earthmoving or land disturbance activity initiated until
the final stormwater management plan for the
development site is approved in accordance with the
provisions of this Part. The design of all stormwater
management facilities shall incorporate sound engineering
principles and practices. The Township shall reserve the
right to disapprove any design that would result in the
continuation or exacerbation of a documented adverse
hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
(b) A letter from the Butler County Conservation District
approving the erosion and sedimentation control plan
must also be received prior to the initiation of any grading.
In the event that submission to the Butler County
Conservation District is not required by the Township, an
erosion and sediment pollution control plan prepared in
accordance with the most recent version of PADEP
Chapter 102, Erosion and Sedimentation Control Program
Manual, must be approved by the Township.

should be noted that temporary roadways are not
exempt.
10) The Township may deny or revoke any exemption
pursuant to this section at any time for any project
that the Township believes may pose a threat to public
health, safety, property or the environment.
11) Small Developments. A "small development" shall be
defined as a site that creates less than 5,000 square
feet of impervious surface, and shall be exempt from
the preparation of a detailed stormwater management
plan as specified in § 17-350.7C. However, such

1) Identify the proposed ownership entity (e.g.,
Township, property owner, homeowners' association,
other management entity) and maintenance
responsibility for all permanent stormwater
management facilities.
2) A maintenance program for all facilities that outlines
the anticipated maintenance tasks, required
inspection, frequencies and inspection guidelines.
Provisions for scheduled vegetation maintenance for
open facilities shall be included to prevent overgrowth
from limiting proper operation and inspection of the
facility(s).
3) Include a maintenance program for all postconstruction
stormwater BMPs, outlining the type of
maintenance activities, probable frequencies,
personnel and equipment requirements, and
estimated annual maintenance costs. The
maintenance program shall include specific
requirements for during construction and for after
construction.
4) Identify the method of financing for continuing
operation and maintenance of the facility.
5) The owner is responsible for operation and
maintenance of the stormwater BMPs. If the owner
fails to adhere to the operation and maintenance
(O&M) agreement, the Township may perform the
services required and charge the owner appropriate
fees. Nonpayment of fees may result in a lien against
the property. A note shall be placed on the recorded
plan: "As per the approved stormwater management
plan, the Township shall have right of access to the onsite
detention facility for the right of maintenance,
monitoring, and/or sampling, in the event the owner,
assigns or heirs do not adequately maintain or monitor
the facility. The owner, assigns or heirs shall
reimburse the Township for all costs associated with
said maintenance. The aformentioned rights granted
the Township in no way diminish the responsibility of
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:256
the owner, assigns or heirs of said maintenance and
monitoring, and no liability will be assumed by the
Township associated with required access for
maintenance or monitoring purposes."
6) Identification of short-term and long-term ownership,
operation, and maintenance responsibilities as well as
schedules and costs for inspection and maintenance
activities for each permanent stormwater or drainage
BMP, including provisions for permanent access or
maintenance easements.
7) If a development consists of structures or lots that are
to be separately owned and in which streets, sewers,
and other public improvements are to be dedicated to
the Township, stormwater control facilities/BMPs may
also be dedicated to and maintained by the Township.
The Township has full discretion to accept any such
dedication.
8) If a development site is to be maintained in a single
ownership or if sewers and other public improvements
are to be privately owned and maintained, then the
ownership and maintenance of stormwater control
facilities/BMPs shall be the responsibility of the owner
or private management entity.
9) Facilities, areas, or structures used as stormwater
BMPs shall be enumerated as permanent real estate
appurtenances and recorded as deed restrictions or
easements that run with the land.
10) The SWM site plan and report shall be recorded as a
restrictive deed covenant that runs with the land.
11) The Township may take enforcement actions against
an applicant for failure to satisfy any provision of this
Part.
12) The Township, upon recommendation of the Township
Engineer, shall make the final determination on the
continuing maintenance responsibilities prior to final
approval of the SWM site plan and report. The
Township may require a dedication of such facilities as
part of the requirements for approval of the SWM site
plan. Such a requirement is not an indication that the
Township will accept the facilities. The Township
reserves the right to accept or reject the ownership
and operating responsibility for any portion of the
stormwater management controls.
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:257
13) The Township's acceptance of any dedicated
stormwater BMP may be conditioned upon the
payment of a fee to cover future costs of inspection,
operation, maintenance and replacement, said fee to
be calculated by the Township Engineer.
14) It shall be unlawful to alter or remove any permanent
stormwater BMP required by an approved SWM site
plan or to allow the property to remain in a condition
that does not conform to an approved SWM site plan,
unless the Township grants an exception in writing.
15) Prior to final approval of the SWM site plan and
report, the applicant shall sign an operation and
maintenance (O&M) agreement in form and substance
approved by the Township Solicitor and the Board of
Supervisors.
16) No person shall modify, remove, fill, landscape, or
alter any existing stormwater BMP, facilities, areas, or
structures, unless it is part of an approved
maintenance program, without the written approval of
the Township.
17) No person shall place any structure, fill, landscaping,
or vegetation into a stormwater BMP, facilities, areas,
structures, or within a drainage easement which
would limit or alter the functioning of the BMP
without the written approval of the Township.
(3) A copy of the proposed erosion and sedimentation control
narrative and plans shall be submitted. The narrative and
accompanying plans shall also be submitted to the Butler
County Conservation District for review and approval.
(4) Stormwater Controls. All proposed stormwater runoff control
measures must be shown on the development site plans,
including methods for collecting, conveying and storing
stormwater runoff on-site. The preliminary plan should provide
information on the general type, location, sizing, etc., of all
proposed facilities and their relationship to the existing
watershed drainage system.
(a) The development site plan shall show the present contours
of the land and the proposed contours of the land after
completion of the proposed grading at one-foot intervals
where slopes are less than 5%, two-foot intervals where
the average slope is between 5% and 15% and at five-foot
intervals where the average slope exceeds 15%.

proposed easements and rights-of-way for drainage and/or
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:258
access to stormwater control facilities shall be shown, and
the proposed owner identified. Drainage easements shall be
delineated and recorded for all permanent facilities, swales
and storm sewers to identify their owner, purpose, permanency
and provide maintenance access. Any areas subject to special
deed restrictions relative to or affecting stormwater
management on the development site shall be shown.
Easements shall prohibit excavation, the placement of fill,
vegetation, or structures, and any alteration that may
adversely affect the flow of stormwater or the function of a
stormwater BMP in the easement.
(a) Easements are required for all areas used for off-site
stormwater control.
(b) Where possible, easements shall be centered on side and/
or rear lot lines.
(c) Nothing shall be planted or placed within the easement
that would adversely affect the function of the easement or
conflict with any conditions associated with such
easement.
(d) All easements shown on the plan shall identify the owner,
purpose or use. Example: "Private drainage easement to
homeowners' association for ownership and maintenance."
(6) Permits/Approvals. A list of any approvals/permits relative to
stormwater management that will be required from other
governmental agencies (e.g., dam or encroachment permits
from PADEP) and anticipated dates of submission/receipt
should be included with the plan submission. Copies of
applications may be requested by the Township. All stormwater
or drainage-related computations or reports associated with
these permit applications shall be submitted to the Township
for reference and for review. Copies of all approved
aforementioned permits and conditions shall be submitted to
the Township upon receipt for reference purposes.
(7) One-Hundred-Year Floodplain Delineation.
(a) Stormwater management facilities located within or
affecting the floodplain of any watercourse shall also be
subject to the requirements of § 27-504, Floodplain Areas
Overlay District, of the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27], as
amended from time to time, which regulates construction
and development within areas of the Township subject to
flooding.
(b) The one-hundred-year floodplain must be delineated on all
plans for all watercourses which have a watershed area of
150 acres or greater. Where, in the judgment of the
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:259
Township, private property or public facilities may be
adversely affected by the proposed activity, the onehundred-
year floodplain shall be established for any
watercourse.
(c) The one-hundred-year floodplain shall be delineated by
one of the following methods:
1) The Flood Insurance Study by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
2) A hydrologic report prepared by an individual
registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
perform such duties. Calculations and channel
hydraulic characteristics used to determine floodplain
limits shall be provided.
(d) Minimum Basement Elevation. The minimum basement
elevation of all structures adjacent to a stream, pond or
stormwater management facility shall be a minimum of
1 1/2 feet above the one-hundred-year water surface
elevation, measured at the upstream extent of the
building. The regulating one-hundred-year water surface
elevation associated with ponds or stormwater
management facilities shall be the one-hundred-year
elevation determined for emergency spillway calculations.
All other provisions cited in § 27-504, Floodplains Areas
Overlay District, of the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27]
shall apply.
(8) Post-Construction Stormwater Management BMP Controls.
Show any and all existing and proposed stormwater
management or drainage controls and/or structures, such as
storm sewers, swales, culverts, etc., that are located on the
development site, or that are located off-site but will be
affected by runoff from the development.
(9) Municipal Liability Disclaimer. Approval of a stormwater
management plan by the Township shall not be construed as an
indication that said plan complies with the requirements, laws,
or standards of any agency of the commonwealth which may or
may not govern said activity.
D. Design Criteria for Stormwater Detention Facilities. The following
criteria shall be utilized for the design of proposed detention
facilities:
(1) Detention facility(s) shall be designed such that the postdevelopment
peak runoff rates from the developed site are
controlled at levels consistent with the allowable release rates
determined for the one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and onehundred-
year design storms.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:260
(2) All detention facilities shall be equipped with outlet structures
to provide discharge control for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year storm events. Provisions
shall also be made for auxiliary structures (e.g., emergency
spillways) that are capable of passing the unattenuated, postdevelopment
one-hundred-year storm peak flows, presuming
blockage of all lower flow controls, without damaging the
facilities. Open channel type emergency spillways shall be
designed at an elevation above the design one-hundred-year
water surface elevation for the facility.
(3) Shared storage facilities, which provide stormwater detention
for more than one development site, will be encouraged. Such
facilities shall meet the design criteria contained in this Part.
Runoff from the development sites involved shall be conveyed
to the facility in a manner so as to avoid adverse impacts, such
as flooding or erosion, to channels and properties located
between the development site and the shared storage facilities.
(4) Where detention facilities are used, the design of multiple-use
facilities, such as ballfields or similar recreational uses, are
encouraged wherever feasible. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses including play areas, picnic grounds, etc.
Consultation with the Township and prior approval are
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds
with stormwater management capabilities may also be
appropriate.
(a) Multiple use basins should be constructed so that
potentially dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed
for a slow release of water or other extended detention
ponds are not permitted for recreational uses, unless the
ponded areas are clearly separated and secure.
(5) As a general rule, detention facilities will be designed as dry
basins, although wet facilities will be considered in specific
situations where they can be shown to represent a significant
amenity or environmental benefit to the development and/or
the Township. Facilities should be designed to induce water
depths as shallow as possible.
(6) Except in approved wet basins, stormwater detention basins
will be designed to drain completely. A low-flow channel with a
minimum slope of 1% shall be installed to facilitate the
conveyance of storm sewer flows to the basin outlet during
frequent storm events. All interior portions of the basin will
slope toward the outlet or low flow channel at a minimum slope
of 2% (SS-19). Except in approved wet basins, all impoundment
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:261
areas shall be adequately underdrained to prevent long-term
ponding of water.
(7) Detention facility outfall pipes shall have a minimum of two
antiseepage collars installed along the profile of the pipe.
Antiseepage collars shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete. Pipe bedding material shall be specified to prohibit
seepage along the pipe trench and shall be in accordance with
pipe manufacturer specifications (SS-20).
(8) All detention facilities designed with an earthen dam shall
provide a minimum of one foot of freeboard between the peak
emergency spillway design flow elevation [§ 17-350.7D(2)] and
the top of the embankment.
(9) Emergency spillways not excavated in existing ground shall be
designed with a suitable erosion protection lining approved by
the Township. Riprap spillways shall provide a concrete cutoff
wall at the spillway design crest elevation or grass-lined
emergency spillway from a detention pond (Drawings SS-21A
and SS-21B).
(10) All embankments will be designed according to sound
engineering practice for such structures and must meet the
approval of the Township. Facilities with a design water depth
in excess of 10 feet may require a supporting report from a
geotechnical engineer and shall be constructed under the
supervision of the geotechnical engineer. In general,
impoundment areas shall be designed to be contained within
areas excavated within existing ground, rather than fill,
whenever possible. Impoundment areas designed within fill
shall require a supporting report from a geotechnical engineer
addressing potential infiltration concerns and recommended
solutions.
(11) A minimum embankment crest width of 10 feet shall be
constructed for all earthen fill embankments. The outside
slopes of the embankment shall not exceed two horizontal to
one vertical. The interior slopes of the facility within the pool
area shall not exceed a slope of three horizontal to one vertical.
Design of facilities with flatter slopes for aesthetics and as a
maintenance consideration are encouraged (SS-16).
(12) Except where special erosion protection measures are
provided, all disturbed areas will be graded evenly, topped with
four inches of topsoil, fertilized, seeded, and mulched by
methods consistent with PennDOT Publication 408. PennDOT
Formula C or equivalent seed mixtures containing crown vetch
shall not be applied to the fill embankments of stormwater
management facilities. The placement of trees within these
areas shall also be prohibited.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:262
(13) All outfalls to and from the facility shall be provided with
endwalls and erosion control measures as per § 17-350.8C.
Where land use and topography are suitable, detention facility
outfalls to existing or constructed wetland areas will be
encouraged to promote the water quality benefits of such
areas.
(a) No outlet structure from a stormwater management
facility or swale shall discharge directly onto a Township
or state roadway without approval from the Township or
PennDOT.
(14) Outlet control structures shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete (cast-in-place or precast) and shall be recessed into
the embankment (SS-17). Trash racks for low-flow control
openings should be designed to provided four to 10 times the
area of the low-flow opening and to facilitate debris removal
and maintenance (SS-18).
(15) Access to all detention facilities shall be provided to the
Township for maintenance purposes. This access shall be via a
minimum ten-foot-wide gravel access road (SS-23) at a
maximum grade of 15% as necessary to access the facility
location, and by a written statement on recorded plans from
the owner/operator of the facility granting access to the
Township as noted in § 17-350.7C(2)(g)5) (SS-23).
(16) Detention facilities that are designed as sedimentation
facilities during construction operations shall be desilted and
regraded to original design dimensions and have all temporary
sedimentation control devices removed prior to their
conversion to detention facilities. Low-flow channels and
underdrains should be installed with the conversion of the
facility.
(17) In subdivisions or projects that are constructed in phases with
individual detention facilities employed as sedimentation
basins, said facilities shall be converted to their ultimate use as
stormwater management facilities as soon as their tributary
areas are stabilized per Butler County Conservation District
standards. This conversion may be requested by the Township,
with supportive corroboration from the Butler County
Conservation District, and shall be implemented as outlined in
§ 17-350.7D(16), and the approved erosion and sedimentation
control plan.
(18) An as-built drawing shall be required for each stormwater
detention facility and BMP constructed. The drawing shall
represent certification of the volume of the facility and the
depth versus storage relationship, as well as the elevational
relationships and dimensions of flow controls, including
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:263
emergency spillways as appropriate. These relationships shall
be shown on the drawing in table form or in report form. In
the event that these relationships vary from the computations
provided in the approved plan, revised storm routings may
be required at the discretion of the Township. Modifications
to the stormwater management facilities may be required by
the Township based on the results of these routings. Final
submission of as-built drawings shall be in accordance with
§ 17-350.3, and Appendix 17-B.28
(19) Inlets structures shall be recessed into the embankment
except when an alternative design is approved by the
Township.
(20) In addition to the requirements of the Code, underground
detention facilities shall meet the following minimum design
standards:
(a) Underground tank facilities shall utilize the largest
practical pipe diameter in order to provide ease of access
for maintenance and inspection.
(b) Design measures to prevent pipe floatation and allow for
visual inspection capabilities, adequate pipe ventilation
and access for maintenance shall be provided.
(c) Underground chambers or pipes shall be aligned parallel
to the contours.
(d) A minimum of two separate accessways to the
underground detention facilities shall be provided for
maintenance personnel.
(e) The underground detention facilities shall be designed to
include overflow controls that either divert runoff via a
flow splitter placed at the facility entrance or an overflow
weir/orifice system designed in conjunction with the outlet
of the facility.
(f) Maximum life expectancy of the underground system shall
also be a design consideration for pipe material
specifications.
(21)Wet Basins. Existing ponds or permanent pool basins may be
used provided they meet the following requirements:
(a) A report, prepared by a biologist, ecologist, or similarly
qualified professional, shall be submitted to the Township
for review that evaluates the design of the proposed wet
basin's ability to meet the following criteria:
28.Editor's Note: Appendix 17-B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:264
1) The minimum permanent pool level to be maintained
shall provide sufficient depth throughout the year to
reduce the growth of unwanted vegetation and
mosquitoes.
2) The pond is of sufficient size to allow the appropriate
aquatic community needed to maintain a healthy pond
ecology.
3) The design of a wet basin shall include the
determination of the proposed site's ability to support
a viable permanent pool. The design should take into
account such factors as the required rate and quality
of dry weather inflow, the quality of stormwater inflow,
seasonal and longer-term variations in groundwater
table, and effects of suspected pollutant loadings.
a) The wet basin shall be aerated with a fountain or
stream bubbler to provide significant water
movement to minimize algae accumulation and to
maintain a healthy pond ecology.
b) An outlet structure shall be designed to allow
complete drainage of the pond for maintenance.
(22) In addition to other requirements of the Code, naturalized
basins shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The interior slopes of the basin within the pool area shall
not exceed a slope of four horizontal to one vertical.
(b) The perimeter of stormwater detention basins shall be
curvilinear so that from most edges of the basin the whole
basin will not be in view. The Township may permit a more
traditionally shaped (oval or rectangular) basin when
conditions such as topography, parcel size, or other site
conditions warrant. When permitted, the basin shall be
designed in consultation with the Township to include a
landscaped island or peninsula large enough and
appropriately placed to reduce the perceived size of the
basin.
(c) All areas of the naturalized basin, including basin floors,
side slopes, berms, impoundment structures, or other
earth structures, shall be planted with suitable vegetation
such as naturalized meadow plantings or lawn grass
specifically suited for stormwater basins. The plantings
shall provide a satisfactory continuous cover to all areas of
the basin and shall not interfere in the safe and efficient
function of the basin as determined by the Township.
(23) Geological Assessment.
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:265
(a) Soils investigation report, including boring logs,
compaction requirements, and recommendations for
construction of detention basins.
(24) Stormwater management facility bottom (or surface of
permanent pool) elevations must be greater than adjacent
floodplain elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS analysis). If no
floodplain is defined, bottom elevations must be greater than
existing ground elevations 50 feet from top of stream bank in
the facilities' vicinity.
(25) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must
account for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the onehundred-
year floodplain elevation must be used for all design
storms, or the applicant may elect to determine flood
elevations of the adjacent watercourse for each design storm.
The floodplain is assumed to be 50 feet from top of stream bank
in areas where a floodway is not designated or no other
evidence is provided.
(26) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater
table. The invert of stormwater facilities may be lowered if
adequate subsurface drainage is provided. Flows from
underdrains need not be accounted for in volume or rate
control calculations.
(27) Whenever possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Vertical side slopes and
rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(28) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for
all stormwater management basins and be specific for each
type of basin.
(a) Minimal-maintenance, saturation-tolerant vegetation must
be provided in basins designed as water quality/infiltration
BMPs.
(29) Berms shall be constructed using soils that conform to the
unified soil classification of CH, MH, CL or ML. Soils used shall
be tested to determine its density analysis per ASTM 698. The
embankments will be constructed in a maximum of six-inch
lifts. The lifts will each be compacted to a density at least 98%
of its maximum dry density. Each layer of compacted fill shall
be tested to determine its density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM
3017. One test per 50 cubic yards of material placed (at least
one per layer) shall be performed by an independent testing
agency.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:266

provided under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
The cutoff trench shall run the entire length of the
embankment and tie into undisturbed natural ground.
(31) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times with copies being forwarded to
the Township Engineer upon request.
(32) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures
shall be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins
within 15 days of construction.
E. Design Criteria for Collection/Conveyance Facilities.
(1) As a general rule, no stormwater may be discharged to
unprotected areas such as hillsides or fills. Stormwater shall
either be conveyed to the nearest established stream channel,
as approved by the Township, or provided with an approved
energy dissipation device. Conveyance shall be by pipe or
erosion protected ditch.
(2) The design for culverts, pipes, and other stormwater
conveyance structures shall be consistent with the design of
the other stormwater management facilities. In the event that
these structures are to be permitted by PADEP or PennDOT,
the design criteria required by the state agency shall be
utilized.
(3) All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and
around structures, including on adjacent properties, to prevent
potential flooding damage.
(4) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel
and close to the top or bottom of major embankments to avoid
the possibility of embankment failure, with the exception of
those facilities specifically designed to prohibit stormwater
runoff from eroding slopes or preventing runoff from damaging
downstream properties.
(5) Stormwater shall be collected and conveyed from upslope
areas in a manner designed to prevent damage to downslope
property(s) consistent with appropriate engineering standards.
This system shall be identified by permanent easements, with
the party responsible for ownership and maintenance
identified.
(6) The design of storm sewer systems shall include evaluation of
inlet grate capacities, bypass flows, entrance losses, storm
pipe capacities, hydraulic grade line computations and outfall
velocities, as appropriate. The storm sewer system shall
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:267
function as intended under all these conditions for the required
design storm as specified in § 17-350.7B(2)(b).
(7) Private stormwater may be connected to the public system
pursuant to Detail SS-15.
(8) The stormwater management site plan shall included
horizontal alignment, vertical profiles, and cross sections of all
open channels, pipes, swales and other BMPs.
(9) Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to
permit unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as
modified by stormwater management facilities or open
channels consistent with this Part.
(10) When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions,
natural drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for
drainage, open channels may be constructed conforming
substantially to the line and grade of such natural
drainageways. Work within natural drainageways shall be
subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or
where deemed appropriate by PADEP, through the general
permit process.
(11) The design of facilities over karst shall include an evaluation
and implementation of measures to minimize adverse effects.
(12) In curbed roadway sections, the maximum encroachment of
water on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a
through travel lane or one inch less than the depth of curb
during the ten-year design storm of five-minute duration.
Gutter depth shall be verified by inlet capture/capacity
calculations that account for road slope and opening area.
(13) Horizontal alignment, vertical profiles and cross sections of all
open channels, pipes, swale and other BMPs shall be provided.
[Added by Ord. 2014-440, 1/30/2014]
F. Disposal of Stormwater from Roof, Foundation and Driveway
Drains.
(1) Individual lots that are required to provide for on-lot
stormwater management facilities per the stormwater
management plan shall be identified on the recorded plan(s)
for the subdivision.
(2) No roof, driveway or foundation drain shall be discharged onto
the right-of-way of any street or the pavement of any street.
Roof drains shall discharge to infiltration areas or vegetative
BMPs to the maximum extent practicable. When it is more
advantageous to connect directly to street or storm sewers,
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:268
then the Township shall permit it on a case-by-case as per
Subsections 6 and 6A. All residential dwellings not connected
to a private or public stormwater collection and management
system shall install a stormwater containment and disposal
system at the direction of the Township in accordance with
(SS-13). This system must be equipped with BMPs to address
runoff quality if the development plan is not designed with
a regional stormwater management facility containing BMPs.
BMP measures shall be privately owned and maintained and
must be implemented on the system on private property. Other
acceptable methods of disposal include underground tanks,
infiltration devices, storm sewers, water gardens, rain barrels,
and grassed or other ground surfaces provided that adequate
consideration is given to erosion protection, or any other
method approved by the Township.
(3) At no time will any roof, driveway or foundation drains be
allowed to be connected to the sanitary sewer line.
(4) The use of splash blocks is permitted. The location of the
splash block discharge must be a minimum of five feet from
foundations and 10 feet from the property line. Exceptions to
this method may be permitted in the instance of townhouses or
similar structures where common property lines exist. No
stormwater runoff may be directed in such a manner as to
disturb or damage neighboring properties.
(5) Houses located on the low side of the road can discharge
drains (minimum of four-inch diameter) to the rear of the lot to
a point of discharge onto a rock apron (size and dimensions to
be specified) not less than 10 feet from the adjacent
neighboring property line when the adjacent property has no
development potential or there is a body of water between the
properties and, provided that said discharge has been
accounted for within the approved stormwater management
plan and the discharge does not impact downstream property
owners.
(6) Lots shall be graded in such a manner as to divert stormwater
runoff away from adjacent property and structures consistent
with appropriate engineering standards.
(7) French drain systems and rainwater collection systems shall be
kept completely separate in all instances.
8. Standard Design Criteria.
A. Storm Sewer Trench SS-01 Within ROW. All storm sewer pipe
within the right-of-way shall be installed in accordance with the

J. Prohibition Against Non-Stormwater Discharges. No person shall
allow or cause to allow discharges or deposition of foreign material
into the Township's separate storm sewer system or stormwater
management systems which are not composed entirely of
stormwater, except discharges allowed under a state or federal
permit or as set forth below:
(1) Prohibited Connections. The following connections to a
Township separate storm sewer system are prohibited:
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:272
(a) Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or
subsurface, which allows any non-stormwater discharge
including sewage, process wastewater, and wash water to
enter the separate storm sewer system, and any
connections to the storm drain system from indoor drains
and sinks.
(b) Any drain or conveyance connected from a nonresidential
land use to the Township's separate storm sewer system
that has not been documented in plans, maps, or
equivalent records, and approved by the Township.
(2) Discharges that may be allowed based on a finding by the
Township that the discharge(s) do not significantly contribute
to pollution of surface waters of the commonwealth are:
(a) Discharges from firefighting activities.
(b) Uncontaminated water from foundation or from footing
drains.
(c) Potable water sources, including dechlorinated water line
and fire hydrant flushings.
(d) Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands.
(e) Lawn watering.
(f) Irrigation drainage.
(g) Springs.
(h) Pavement wash waters where spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spill
material has been removed) and where detergents are not
used.
(i) Routine external building washdown (which does not use
detergents or other compounds).
(j) Air-conditioning condensate.
(k) Water from individual residential car washing.
(l) Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges.
(m) Uncontaminated groundwater.
(n) Water from crawl space pumps.
(3) In the event that the Township subsequently determines that
any of the discharges identified within Subsection J(2)
significantly contribute to pollution of waters of the
commonwealth, or if so notified by DEP, then the Township will
immediately notify the responsible person to cease the
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:273
discharge or provide testing data that shows the discharge in
question does not degrade the receiving stream characteristics
as listed in 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 93.
(4) Upon notice provided by the Township under Subsection J(3),
the discharger will have a reasonable time, as determined by
the Township, to cease the discharge consistent with the
degree of pollution caused by the discharge.
(5) Nothing in this section shall affect a discharger's
responsibilities under state law.
K. Suggested Post-Construction Stormwater BMPs.
(1) Innovative stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are
encouraged (e.g., rooftop storage, drywells, cisterns,
recreation area ponding, diversion structures, porous
pavements, holding tanks, infiltration systems, in-line storage
in storm sewers, and grading patterns). They shall be located,
designed, and constructed in accordance with the latest
technical guidance published by PADEP, provided that they are
accompanied by detailed engineering plans and performance
capabilities and supporting site specific soils, geology, runoff
and groundwater and infiltration rate data to verify proposed
designs. Additional guidance from other sources may be
accepted at the discretion of the Township Engineer (a
preapplication meeting is suggested).
(a) The following is a listing of detention and control methods
that may be used in stormwater management systems, if
appropriate. The choice of control techniques is not
limited to those appearing on this list.
1) Detention/retention basins.
2) Roof-top storage.
3) Parking lot and street storage.
4) Seepage pits, seepage trenches, level spreaders or
other infiltration structures.
5) Bioretention areas.
6) Porous payement and concrete lattice block surfaces.
7) Grassed channels and vegetated strips.
8) Routed flow over grass.
9) Decreased impervious area coverage.
10) Water quality storage volume in detention facilities.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:274
(b) The use of other control methods which meet the criteria
in this section shall be permitted when approved by the
Township Engineer. Various combinations of methods
should be designed to suit the particular requirements of
the type of development and the topographic features of
the project area. Additional erosion and sedimentation
control design standards and criteria that must be applied
where infiltration BMPs are proposed include the
following:
1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be
protected from sedimentation and compaction during
the construction phase so as to maintain their
maximum infiltration capacity.
2) Infiltration BMPs shall be protected from receiving
sediment-laden runoff.
3) The source of protection for infiltration BMPs shall be
identified (i.e., orange construction fence surrounding
the perimeter of the BMP).
(2) Infiltration. Prevention of stormwater runoff is the key
objective of 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 93, of the PADEP regulations
since runoff can change the physical, chemical, and biological
integrity of waterbodies thereby impacting water quality. All
stormwater management plans shall describe how these water
quality protection requirements will be met.
(a) Infiltration BMPs shall be evaluated and utilized to the
maximum extent possible to manage the net change in
stormwater runoff generated so that post-construction
discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical, and
biological characteristics of the receiving waters. These
BMPs may be used to satisfy all or part of the
requirements in this subsection.
1) Description of, justification, and actual field results for
infiltration testing with respect to the type of test and
test location for the design of infiltration BMPs.
(b) Post-construction stormwater infiltration of runoff shall
replicate preconstruction infiltration of runoff to the
maximum extent possible. In calculating the recharge
volume of runoff that can be infiltrated at a site, the
following methodology shall be used:
REv = [(S){0.05+0.009(I)}(A)]/12
Where
S = Soil specific recharge factor in inches (obtain
from table below).
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:275
I = Impervious surface percentage.
A = Project area in acres.
REv, recharge volume, is computed in acre-feet
Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) S
A 0.38
B 0.25
C 0.13
D 0.06
If more than one HSG is present at a site, a composite
recharge volume shall be computed based on the
proportion of the total site area within each HSG.
(c) A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be
performed to determine the suitability of infiltration BMPs.
The evaluation shall be performed by a qualified
professional and, at a minimum, address soil permeability,
depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and
subgrade stability. If infiltration is not a viable option on
the subject site, the water quality storage option must be
implemented as described in Subsection 8K(3).
(d) All infiltration BMPs shall be located a minimum of 10 feet
away from the foundation wall of any structure.
(e) Any infiltration BMP shall be capable of infiltrating the
impounded water within 48 hours.
1) Unless specifically designed as a volume control or
water quality facility, all stormwater management
facilities must empty over a period of time not less
than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours from the
end of the facility's inflow hydrograph. Infiltration
tests performed at the facility locations and proposed
basin bottom depths, in accordance with the BMP
Manual, must support time-to-empty calculations if
infiltration is a factor.
(f) The infiltration system shall have positive overflow
controls to prevent storage within one foot of the finished
surface or grade.
(g) Infiltration rates shall not be used in computing the
storage volume of the detention/retention system for the
development.
(h) Infiltration BMPs shall not be used in areas of known strip
mining or in limestone areas.
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:276
(3) Water Quality Storage. In order to protect and maintain water
quality, additional stormwater runoff created by proposed
developments must be captured, stored, and treated. In
addition, post-construction stormwater infiltration of runoff
must replicate preconstruction infiltration of runoff to the
maximum extent possible.
(a) The volume of additional stormwater runoff to be
captured, stored, and treated is called the "water quality
volume" (WQv). The formula for determining WQv is:
WQv = [(P){0.05+0.009(I)}(A)]/12
Where
P = Rainfall depth of 1-year storm = 1.13 inches.
I = Impervious surface percentage.
A = Drainage area in acres.
WQv is computed in acre-feet.
(b) This volume is to be released over a twenty-four-hour
extended detention period. This calculation is to be
performed as a separate detention facility routing in the
submitted stormwater management report.
(c) Meet the water quality goals of this Part by implementing
measures to:
1) Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, natural
slopes, existing native vegetation and woodlands.
2) Create, maintain, or extend riparian buffers and
protect existing forested buffers.
3) Provide trees and woodlands adjacent to impervious
areas whenever feasible.
4) Minimize the creation of impervious surfaces and the
degradation of waters of the commonwealth and
promote groundwater recharge.
5) Protect natural systems and processes (drainageways,
vegetation, soils, and sensitive areas) and maintain, as
much as possible, the natural hydrologic regime.
6) Incorporate natural site elements (wetlands, stream
corridors, mature forests) as design elements.
7) Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow
pathways.
8) Minimize soil disturbance and soil compaction.
§ 17-350 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-350
1:277
9) Minimize thermal impacts to waters of the
commonwealth.
10) Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to
pervious areas wherever possible and decentralize
and manage stormwater at its source.
(4) Alteration of BMPs. No person shall modify, remove, fill,
landscape, or alter any existing stormwater BMP, including
stormwater channels, unless part of an approved maintenance
program, without the written approval of the Township.
L. Best Management Practices (BMPs). The use of practical structural
and nonstructural BMPs will be encouraged by the Township in the
design of site drainage systems and land development. Design of
such measures shall consider the limitations of the site topography
and soils, as well as identify the benefits of proposed measures and
maintenance requirements. Technical requirements and limitations
of BMPs are provided in the Pennsylvania Handbook of Best
Management Practices for Developing Areas. The standard set
forth in the most current version of this document shall be
considered the construction standards of this Part.
M. Sensitive Areas and Stormwater Hotspots.
(1) Sensitive Areas and Stormwater Hotspots: Sensitive areas and
water quality sensitive developments as defined below which
require special consideration with regard to stormwater
management.
(a) "Sensitive areas" are defined as those areas that, if
developed, have the potential to endanger a water supply.
These areas consist of the delineated one-year zone of
contribution and direct upslope areas tributary to the
water supply wells. Municipalities may update the
sensitive area boundaries based on new research or
studies as required.
(b) "Stormwater hotspots" are defined as a land development
project that has a high potential to endanger local water
quality, and could potentially threaten groundwater
reservoirs. The Township Engineer will determine what
constitutes these classifications on a case-by-case basis.
The PADEP wellhead protection contaminant source list
shall be used as a guide in these determinations. Industrial
manufacturing site and hazardous material storage areas
must provide NPDES SIC codes.
(2) Performance Standards.
(a) The location of the boundaries of sensitive areas is set by
drainage areas tributary to any public water supply. The
§ 17-350 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-350
1:278
exact location of these boundaries as they apply to a given
development site shall be determined using mapping at
a scale that accurately defines the limits of the sensitive
area. If the project site is within the sensitive area (in
whole or in part), two-foot contour interval mapping shall
be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area. If
the project site is adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of
a defined sensitive area, a five-foot contour interval map
defining the limits of the sensitive area shall be included in
the stormwater management plan to document the site's
location relative to the sensitive area.
(b) Stormwater hotspots may be required to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan and file
notice of intent as required under the provision of the EPA
Industrial Stormwater NPDES Permit Requirements.
(c) Stormwater hotspots must use an acceptable pretreatment
BMP prior to volume control and/or rate control BMPs.
Acceptable pretreatment BMPs for these developments
include those based on filtering, settling, or chemical
reaction processes such as coagulation.

1:281
shall meet with the Township for a consultation meeting on
a concept plan for the post-development stormwater
management system to be utilized in the proposed project.
This consultation meeting shall take place at the time of the
preliminary plan or other early step in the development
process. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the postdevelopment

C. Rights-of-Way.
(1) The alignments and locations of the proposed pipe lines and
appurtenances are shown on the plans on which street,
highway and/or other acquired rights-of-way limits have also
been superimposed. No pipe line shall be relocated outside of
the street or other right-of-way within which it is shown
without obtaining the formal written approval for such chance
from the Township.
(2) Where a special pipe line right-of-way is obtained through
private property, the minimum permanent width for operation
and maintenance purposes shall be 20 feet; the width of the
temporary right-of-way obtained through such private
properties for initial pipe line installation and construction
purposes shall be 40 feet, 10 feet of which shall be located
adjacent to and on the outside of both limits of the permanent
right-of-way. The minimum distance between the center of any
longitudinal pipe line and the right-of-way limit line shall be
five feet. All construction activities shall be confined within the
40 feet wide construction right-of-way as much as possible.
(3) The contractor shall, however, make his own arrangements for
office space, materials storage yards, change trailers, sanitary
facilities, utility services, debris disposal sites, and for ingress
and egress to any location along the pipe line project for which
the contractor desires or requires use and, for which the
Township has been granted no such right-of-way.
(4) Proposed pipe lines and appurtenances may also encroach
upon, right-of-way occupied by pipelines or other facilities
owned, operated and/or maintained by other utility companies

longitudinally, along either the water or sanitary sewer lines,
any closer than three feet. It is imperative that such minimum
distance be maintained along all sanitary sewer and water
lines to provide space required for future maintenance and/or
repairs.
§ 17-403 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-403
1:297
(6) The separation between sanitary sewer and waterline pipe(s)
shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Pennsylvania
Department of Protection, in accordance with Detail Drawing
SW-5.
D. Control of Pipe Line Elevations and Alignments.
(1) The contractor shall confirm the elevation of all existing
facilities to which proposed facilities will connect, as well as
the profile of the existing and/or finished (in the case of land
development projects) ground lines, prior to commencement of
construction, to confirm compatibility.
(2) All sewer lines shall be required to be constructed and the
elevations and alignment shall be controlled by the use of laser
equipment. Sewer line construction shall begin at the manhole
with the lowest invert elevation unless prior approval is
granted by the Township. Water lines shall be installed on
uniform slopes as indicated on the profiles to assure that the
air release valves (where indicated) will function effectively.
Similarly, such grade controls of waterlines shall also be
implemented to assure that blow-off assemblies are properly
located.
(3) The contractor shall employ competent field survey personnel
as may be required to control grades and/or alignment of
proposed facilities and to assist the Township by obtaining
information during construction progress, and for purposes of
preparing as-built record drawings.
E. Traffic Warning Signs, Barricades, Lights and Control.
(1) Where pipe lines and/or other facilities are constructed along
State Highways and/or Township Streets, and where
construction activities may otherwise impede normal vehicular
traffic patterns on said highways or streets, the control of
traffic shall be accomplished in accordance with the details set
forth in Publication 203 of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, the title of which is "Work Zone Traffic
Control."
(2) The position of work zone signs, erection of signs, sizes of
signs, details and configuration of signs, traffic channelizing,
tapered lengths/spacing, cones, drums, vertical panels,
lighting devices, arrow boards and all flagging conduct and
activities shall conform to the details described therein. The
location and configuration of traffic control methods shall
conform to those graphically illustrated on the appertaining
Table 5 and Figures 5 through 23 shown in the publication. The
contractor shall submit a traffic control plan and procedure
(conforming to the above referenced Publication 203) to the
§ 17-403 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-403
1:298
Township for approval, prior to commencing with field
construction.
F. Exploratory Excavations.
(1) Some of the proposed pipe lines and appurtenant structures
are somewhat flexible with respect to alignment. Therefore, in
those existing streets, roadways, berms or other areas
expected to have a number of underground utility lines, where
there are large trees which may be saved by realignment, and
where the Township so directs, the contractor shall make
appropriate exploratory excavations for the purpose of locating
said lines.
(2) In all instances, the costs associated with exploratory
excavations shall be the responsibility of the contractor, and
any realignment of pipelines shall be approved by the
Township.
G. Existing Utility Lines  Location, Protection and Hazards.
(1) The plans show those underground water lines, gas lines,
electric lines, cable TV lines, telephone lines, sanitary sewers,
storm drains, conduits and other similar utility lines and
appurtenances for which said location information was either
made available to the designer, or was observed in the field.
Neither the number of such underground facilities nor their
respective types, sizes and/or locations can be assured or
guaranteed and it is therefore, the responsibility of the
contractor to obtain such additional information; as is required
to properly complete the work in compliance with the
specifications, and to contact the owners of the various utilities
in the area prior to starting and during performance of the
work accordance with 73 P.S. § 180.
(2) The approximate location of any power and telephone poles
and guy poles along the route of the work is shown on the
drawings and the overhead lines supported by all such poles
shall be observed and located by the contractor prior to
commencement of the work.
(3) The contractor shall be completely and solely responsible for
any and all property damages, bodily injuries financial losses
and interruption of service that results from or are attributable
to his construction activities and, which affect water lines, gas
lines, electric lines, telephone lines, drain lines, sanitary and
storm sewer lines and all appurtenances and service facilities
connected thereto. Restoration of all such disturbed facilities
shall be accomplished immediately after incurrence thereto.
(4) Water, sewer, gas, power and telephone service to dwellings or
places of business shall be maintained with a minimum of
§ 17-403 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-403
1:299
interruption throughout the construction of the contract work.
No such service shall be intentionally interrupted without the
approval of the respective utility company concerned, and
without first giving due warning to the occupants of said
dwelling or business establishment. At least three working
days notice of an interruption in service shall be given to the
Township so that the Township may notify its customers.
(5) In some areas, it may be found that existing pipe lines are in a
location where construction of the proposed work cannot
reasonably proceed until the utility has been relocated. The
contractor shall make all necessary subsurfaces investigations
and shall locate such utility mains far enough in advance of the
trenching work so that work progress is not unnecessarily
interrupted.
(6) Attention is directed to the fact that the proposed work could
be in close proximity to overhead power lines which transmit
electric current at high voltages and which, if disturbed or
contacted during construction, would be hazardous to
construction personnel and/or other persons. The contractor
shall, therefore, properly protect such wires, pole supports or
other power line appurtenances to avoid disturbance to those
facilities, and shall operate all machinery and conduct all other
construction activities in a manner which will assure
protection of all construction personnel and other persons
against said hazards.
(7) Work in the vicinity of the existing underground gas lines and
appurtenances is also hazardous because under certain
conditions, such materials are flammable and/or explosive and,
the contractor shall avoid all temporary and permanent
supports and other required protection to prevent exposure of
the same to construction personnel and/or other persons.
Where such lines are exposed during construction and leakage
is detected, construction work in those areas shall be
immediately suspended, the owner of the pipe lines shall be
immediately advised of the condition and the construction
work shall not resume until all repairs have been properly
completed.
(8) The construction activities required to be performed in the
conduct of the work may necessitate the interconnection,
interception, surveying, inspection, removal, replacement and
repair of certain existing manholes, sewer pipes and
appurtenances. Said items are conveying all wastes and runoff
discharged to and infiltrating into the public sewer system
within the area served, which wastes may contain and/or
generate toxic, noxious oxygen depleting or other liquid or
gaseous substances harmful to human beings.
§ 17-403 CRANBERRY CODE § 17-403
1:300
(9) The contractor shall also provide all personnel with all tools,
clothing and other devices necessary for such safe practice,
including appropriate waterproof clothing, respirators,
protective glasses, mechanical air blowing equipment to preventilate
manholes and other chambers, explosive atmosphere
detectors, ladders, safety harnesses, etc. No work shall be
performed under any unsafe conditions and if same is detected
at any time, the contractor shall, therefore, thoroughly instruct
all personnel involved in such work so that appropriate and
complete safety practices are observed at all times.

grading administrator may make such special reasonable exceptions
thereto, upon recommendation from the Township Engineer, as will not
be contrary to the public interest, and may impose such conditions as it
deems necessary to adequately protect the public interest.
1. Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and
void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced
within six months or is not completed within 18 months from the date of
issue, provided that the Township Manager may, if the permit holder
presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented
work being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant
a reasonable extension of time, and provided further that the
application for the extension of time is made before the date of
expiration of the permit.
2. Any physical changes from the original plan uncovered in the site
during the construction such as surface water drainage, soil and
bedrock dislocations, alteration of ground water discharge or any other
natural or man-made modification which would tend to adversely affect
the basis upon which the permit was issued, must be immediately
reported to the grading administrator by the permit holder. If the
circumstances dictate, the grading administrator shall revoke the
permit or otherwise modify the conditions upon which the permit was
initially issued.

amended by Ord. 2005-362, 12/15/2005]
Where, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, the work as proposed by
the applicant is likely to endanger any property or person or any street or
alley or create hazardous conditions, the grading administration shall deny
the permit. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to endanger
property or streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the Township
Engineer shall give due consideration to: possible saturation by rains, earth
movements, runoff surface waters and subsurface conditions such as the
stratification and faulting of rock aquifers, springs and the nature and type
of the soil or rock.

a permit fee. Fees will be consistent with the Fee Resolution adopted by
the Board of Supervisors and may be amended from time to time.
2. Before issuance of a grading permit, the applicant shall post all
necessary security, in accordance with the requirements set forth in
§ 17-510 of this part.
A. As a condition of grading approval for projects having an estimated cost
of $25,000 or more, the applicant shall post a security acceptable to the
Township in the amount of 110% of the estimated cost to perform the
grading and remedial work. The cost estimate shall include the
complete scope of work needed to be performed by the applicant to
comply with this part and shall be determined by the Township
Engineer.
(1) For projects having an estimated cost to perform the work of less
than $25,000, security in the amount of 50% of the estimate as
determined by the Township Engineer shall be provided.
B. No security shall be required if security is posted for construction and/
or site improvements which already covers the cost of grading and
other control facilities.
1. Application for the permit by the applicant shall constitute consent to
enter the site for inspections at any time.
A. The Township shall, when requested by the permit holder, make the
inspections hereinafter required and shall either approve that

amended by Ord. 2005-362, 12/15/2005]
The following general working conditions will apply to all grading sites:
portion of the work which has been completed or notify the permit
holder wherein the same fails to comply with the provisions of
this part. Where it is found by inspection that the soil or other
conditions are not as stated or shown in the application, the
Township may refuse to approve further work until approval is
obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to existing
conditions.
2. Plans for grading work bearing the approval of the Township shall be
maintained at the site during the progress of the grading work and until
the work has been approved.
3. The permit holder shall notify the grading administrator in order to
obtain inspections in accordance with the following schedule and at
least 48 hours before the inspection is to be made. Before calling for
any inspection, the owner shall have the property line stakes set and
sufficient grade stakes set by a registered engineer  surveyor to
enable the grading administrator to verify the grading operation.
A. Initial inspection: when work on the excavation or fill is about to be
commenced.

and crib walls when reinforcing steel is in place and before
concrete is poured.
E. Final inspection: when all work, including the installation of all
drainage and other structures, has been completed.
4. If at any stage of the work the grading administrator shall determine by
inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as
authorized by an existing permit is likely to endanger property or
streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the Township may
require as a condition to allowing the work to be done that such
reasonable safety precautions be taken as the grading administrator
considers advisable to avoid such likelihood of danger. Safety
precautions may include but shall not be limited to specifying a flatter
exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms,
temporary safety fencing, terracing, compaction or cribbing.

outside a structure, in conjunction with work requiring a building
permit, which causes a noise sufficient to disturb the peace and general
tranquility of the general public or any portion thereof shall be
prohibited in the entire Township between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and
7:00 a.m., Monday through Saturday, and all day Sunday and on
Federally designated legal holidays.
A. Maximum slope steepness of a cut shall be two horizontal to one
vertical for minimizing erosion and landslide hazards. However, upon a
determination by a governmental review agency or a registered soils
engineer that the properties of the types of soil on the site to be graded,
as identified by the soil survey, other standard surveys, geological
surveys or core borings, require special consideration, then maximum
slopes may then be determined as follows.
(1) Landslide prone soils or unstable rock formations where existing
slopes are less than 25% shall have proposed cut slopes no steeper
than that are recommended by a registered soils engineer. A
document signed and sealed by said engineer shall be forwarded to
the Township prior to approval of the grading permit. Soil survey
map symbols for landslide prone soils are:
(a) UGD urban land  Guernsey complex, gently sloping 0%  8%
slope.
(b) UGD urban land  Guernsey Complex, Moderately sloping 8%
 25% slope.
B. Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be allowed
under a grading permit, provided one or both of the following is
satisfied.
(1) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope steeper than the slope specified above for
recognized soil conditions on the site. A written statement, signed
and sealed by a registered soils engineer, stating that the steeper
slope will have sufficient stability and that risk of creating a hazard
will be slight, must be submitted to the grading administrator.

§ 17-514. Fills. [Ord. 95-251, 7/16/1987, § 14; as amended by Ord.
2005-362, 12/15/2005]
Standards for fills shall be as follows:
(2) A retaining wall or other approved support designed, signed and
sealed by a professional structural engineer and approved by the
administrator is provided to support the face of excavation.
C. The bottom edge of final slopes shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet
from adjacent property lines, excepting side property lines and street
right-of-way lines, in which case the distance shall be a minimum of five
feet, in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without
encroaching on the abutting property or street and to allow for location
of proper drainage facilities and protective devices.
D. Before commencing any excavation which will in any way affect an
adjoining property or structures thereon, the person making the
excavation shall notify in writing the owners of the adjacent property or
buildings not less than 30 calendar days before such excavation is to be
made that the proposed excavation is to be started. Copies of all such
notices shall be supplied to the grading administrator.
E. The grading administrator may require an excavation to be made with a
cut slope flatter than those specified above if he finds the material in
which the excavation is to be made is unusually subject to erosion, or if
other conditions exist which, under applicable engineering practice,
make such flatter cut slope necessary for stability and safety.
(1) Excavations adjacent to any footing, foundation or structure shall
not extend below the minimum angle of repose or natural slope of
the soil under the nearest point of same unless such footing,
foundation or structure is first properly underpinned or otherwise
protected against settlement.
A. No fill shall be made in Township which creates a slope steeper than
two horizontal to one vertical. However, the Township, on the advice
and recommendation of a registered soils engineer, may impose
conditions requiring that a fill be constructed with an exposed surface
flatter than two horizontal to one vertical if the soils engineer states
that under the particular circumstances involved, such flatter surface is
necessary for stability and for the safety of persons and property.
B. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or earth,
the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements.
(1) The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time as
determined by the Township Engineer and specified on the grading
permit.
§ 17-513 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 17-514
1:387
(2) Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill, including all embankments, planting and
seeding areas, to a minimum depth of six inches to effectively
conceal all materials used in the fill other than clean soil or earth.
Prior to spreading topsoil, the subgrade shall be scarified to a
depth of two inches to facilitate the bonding of the subsoil with the
topsoil. If the filling operation is intermittent, the Township
Engineer may require that the top and exposed surfaces of the fill
be so covered at the completion of each lift.
(3) No fill of any kind shall be placed over topsoil, trees, stumps or
other material which would create a nuisance, potential fire hazard
or sanitary problem such as decomposition which would attract
rodents, termites or other pests.
(4) Fill areas shall be prepared by removing organic material such as
vegetation and rubbish, and any other material determined by the
grading administrator to prevent proper compaction and stability.
C. Where fills are located so that earth movement may result in personal
injury or damage to adjacent property, streets, alleys or buildings, the
bearing value and stability of the material under proposed fills and
embankments shall be determined by subsurface investigation
performed by a soils engineer.
D. Rock may be incorporated into fills and embankments but only in layers
as per the latest edition of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PennDOT) Specifications Publication 408, with voids
filled and a blanket of compacted fill separating one layer of rock from
the next. Rock fill shall not be placed near the bottom of foundations,
building caissons and subsurface utility installations. Suitable earth
shall be reserved or provided to cover rock fill under proposed seeded
or planted areas.
E. No unsuitable material, including but not limited to the following: coal,

§ 11.01; as amended by Ord. 2011-416, 8/4/2011, § 31]
All charges for water services furnished by the Township will be based on
the current Fee Resolution in accordance with the following:
§ 18-282. Charges for Active Sewage Service. [Ord. 2002-325, 1/13/
2002, § 11.02]
A. Normal Charges. Each premises will be subject to a fixed minimum
monthly or quarterly charge for each meter, based on the size of the
meter and in accordance with the rate schedule. The use of certain
quantities shall be allowed for each size of meter without additional
charge. Such minimum charge shall be nonabatable for a nonuser of
water, and noncumulative against subsequent consumption. In the case
of fractional bills covering less than a month or quarter, minimum
charges and allowances of water shall be prorated. The charges for the
use of water in excess of the quantities allowed for each size meter will
be in accordance with the meter quantity charges provisions of the rate
schedule. The allowance of water for the minimum charges shall be
deducted from the quantities set forth in applying the meter schedule.
B. Miscellaneous Charges and Basis for Payment. The charges for public
or private fire protection shall be paid quarterly or monthly, prorated
for the per annum charges payable when billed. The Township may bill
the premises directly for fire protection services, such services also
being subject to lien. The charges for temporary service and other
miscellaneous service shall be as set forth elsewhere herein and/or in
the schedule of rates.
1. All charges for sewage services furnished by the Township will be based
on the published schedule of rates of the Township. The charges shall
be based on the quantity of water used on or in said premises, as the
same may be measured by meters or based on the number and type of
fixtures, or based on flat rates, or based on unit charges, or such other
methods, all as approved subject to conditions and to the requirements
and rates set forth in the schedule of rates, and in general, in
accordance with the following:
A. Normal Charges. Each premises will be subject to a fixed minimum
monthly or quarterly charge for sewage services and billed
normally on a water use or fixture basis. The minimum charge shall
be nonabatable for nonusers of water, and noncumulative against
subsequent use. In the case of fractional bills covering less than a
month or a quarter, monthly or minimum charges shall be prorated.
The charges for the use of water in excess of the quantities allowed
under the minimum charges will be in accordance with the
schedule of rates, the allowances of water for the minimum charges
§ 18-281 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 18-282
1:437
to be deducted from the quantities set forth in applying the
schedule. The Township may, at its option, adopt the unit charge or
other methods as a basis of normal billing.
B. Surcharge for Certain Industrial Wastes. The Township may
exercise the right to levy and assess against applicable premises a
surcharge, or surcharges, for the handling and treatment of
abnormal industrial, commercial and other such wastes. The
surcharge represents an apportionment of the cost for handling an
excess load imposed on the sewage treatment plant by wastes
stronger than normal sewage and of the additional costs of
maintaining and operating the public sewerage system. The basis
of such charges shall be as set forth in the schedule of rates.
C. The surcharges will be added to the normal sewage service charge
and shall be subject to the same penalties applicable to other
charges.
D. The strength of wastes subject to a surcharge, or surcharges, shall
be determined periodically by the Township. The frequency and
duration of the sampling period shall be subject to determination
by the Township, and shall be such as will permit reaching
reasonably reliable conclusions as to the average composition of
such wastes, exclusive of stormwater runoff, if any. The manholes
or other facilities required for sampling shall be constructed at the
cost of the owner and/or tenant, and shall be constructed as
previously set forth.
E. The samples will be collected by a representative of the Township,
such samples to be collected in proportion to the flow of wastes,
exclusive of stormwater runoff, if any, and to be composited for
analysis. The procedures and analyses will be in accordance with
the latest edition of "Standard Methods for Examination of Water
and Sewage," as published by the American Public Health
Association.
F. The characteristics and strength of the wastes, as determined by
analyses, shall be used to determine the applicability of the
surcharge, or surcharges, and used as bases for establishing the
amount of the surcharge or surcharges. The Township may assess
the costs of conducting flow measurements, and making the
chemical and other tests, against the owner and/or tenant of the
premises.
G. The Township may, at its option, accept the results of routine
sampling and analyses by the producer of said wastes.

hydrant being flushed. All cost(s) associated with obtaining this data is
the responsibility of the individual(s) making the request for the fire
flow data. This data may be obtained through live fire flow test(s) or via
the Township's water model program. The system losses shall be
mathematically adjusted to account for changes as follows:
A. The water levels in the storage tanks fluctuate on a continuous
basis. Records from circular chart recorders for each of the
Township's storage tanks are kept by the Township. The fire flow
analysis shall use a water level of 1384 feet above mean sea level,
which represents the tanks being one-half full. Static pressures are
to be adjusted accordingly if the water levels in the tanks exceed
this elevation during the hydrant flushing, i.e., if the tanks are more
than one-half full during the flow test.
B. The water mains in the system are of various ages and sizes and
consequently the composite value of the Hazen-Williams friction
factor (C) will vary within the water system. The composite value
shall be calculated based on the system losses recorded during the
hydrant flushing and the system losses shall be mathematically
adjusted based on a C value of 110 for design of the proposed water
system extension.

§ 19-202. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. [Ord.
2006-373, 9/7/2006]
The Township does not regulate, monitor, or enforce any categorical
pretreatment standards under this chapter. Categorical users tributary to
the POTW remain responsible to the EPA for compliance with categorical
standards. The Township may impose local pretreatment limits on a
categorical user through the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit,
which may contain different pollutants and concentrations and amounts
from the categorical limits which apply to the user.
§ 19-203. Local Limits. [Ord. 2006-373, 9/7/2006]
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to
prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair;
J. Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to
the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the Township's
NPDES permit;
K. Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes, except
in compliance with commonwealth or federal regulations;
L. Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof
runoff, or subsurface drainage;
M. Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes;
N. Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the Township
in a wastewater discharge permit;
O. Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test;

or amounts which will cause obstruction interference in the POTW;
R. Wastewater causing two successive readings on an explosion
hazard meter at the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any
point in the POTW, of more than 5% for any single reading over
10% of the lower explosive limit of the meter.
1. For pollutants of concern, the Township shall determine maximum
allowable headworks loadings (MAHLs) to protect against pass-through
and interference. These loadings shall be calculated using data
accumulated through a headworks analysis at the POTW and software
developed by the EPA to establish local limits specific to the POTW. The

§ 19-204. Dilution. [Ord. 2006-373, 9/7/2006]
No user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The Township may impose mass limitations on users who are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements,
or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
MAHLs shall be established by resolution and may be modified as
necessary.
2. To ensure that aggregate amounts of pollutants discharged into the
system do not exceed the MAHLs to the POTW, the Township shall
impose mass or concentration limits for pollutants of concern that may
be discharged into the POTW by significant industrial users with the
issuance of wastewater discharge permits. Such mass or concentration
limits may be modified by the Township.

of producing an effluent with an oil and grease concentration which,
alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other
sources, will not cause obstruction, interference or other problems in
the POTW, and shall be installed and maintained such that excessive
amounts of oil and grease, grit, sand, and inert solids are effectively
prevented from entering the POTW. All interceptors and the associated
plumbing shall be of a design approved by the Township and shall be so
located to be safe and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. The
size of grease interceptors or oil/grit separators shall be determined
initially by the user and a statement indicating that the calculated size
will provide compliance with Township requirements must be submitted
by the user. Such pretreatment facilities shall be inspected, cleaned,
and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at the user's expense.
Failure of the user to properly operate the facility or to install and
maintain a facility of sufficient size to provide compliance with the
Township's requirements shall be considered a violation under this
chapter.
A. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
B. Description of stored chemicals, including the type, nature, and
maximum quantity stored;
C. Procedures for immediately notifying the Township of any accidental or

discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential
problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify
the Township of the incident at the telephone number in the user's
wastewater discharge permit. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume if
known, and corrective actions taken by the user. For any planned
discharge of this type, the user shall give the Township 48 hours' notice.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of
such discharge. Users shall insure that all employees who may cause or
suffer such a discharge to occur are advised on the emergency
notification procedure.

as a result of such discharge, nor shall it relieve the user of any fines,
penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
chapter.
1. Hazardous waste, as defined under 40 CFR Part 261, is prohibited from
being discharged to the POTW.
2. Any user who accidentally discharges hazardous waste to the POTW
shall notify the Township immediately by telephone and follow up with a
written report with details regarding the discharge. Any substance
which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261, is included in this notification. The notification of the
Township does not relieve the user of any federal, commonwealth or
local requirements concerning the handling or reporting of such waste.
1. Except as indicated in Subsection 2, below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the
Township may authorize time proportional sampling or a minimum of
four grab samples where the user demonstrates this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent.
2. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides,

completion of improvements estimated as of 90 days following the
date scheduled for completion by the developer.

of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant or
developer and prepared by an engineer and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown.
C. Resolution of Disputes Regarding Amount. If the applicant or
developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate,
then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
engineer chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or

presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the
event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the applicant or
developer.
D. Adjustment to Amount. Annually, the Township may adjust the
amount of the improvement security by comparing the actual cost
of the improvements which have been completed and the estimated
cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the ninetieth day after either the original date
scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may require the
developer to post additional security in order to assure that the
financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection. If the
party posting the improvement security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the improvement security to
§ 22-305 CRANBERRY CODE § 22-305

security may be increased by an additional 10% for each oneyear
period beyond the first anniversary date from posting of the
improvement security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the
cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on
or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using
the above procedure.
E. Term. The term of the improvement security shall be for a period of
one year from the date that the improvement security is posted.
F. Guarantees in Phased Development. In the case where
development is projected over a period of years, the Supervisors
may authorize submission of final plats by section or stages of
development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to
improvements in future sections or stages of development as it

improvement security in an amount necessary for payment of
contractors performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing
and shall be addressed to the Supervisors. The Supervisors shall have
45 days from the receipt of such request to allow the Township
Engineer to certify, in writing, that such portion of the installation of
public improvements has been completed in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and the approved final plat.
2. Upon such certification by the Township Engineer, the Supervisors shall
authorize release of an amount as estimated by the Township Engineer
which fairly represents the value of the improvements completed. The
Supervisors may require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of such
improvements until such time as all improvements have been installed
and the improvement security is released in its entirety.
3. If the Supervisors fail to act within the forty-five-day period, the
Supervisors shall be deemed to have approved the release of funds as
requested.

the Township Engineer shall perform a final inspection of the public
and private improvements in the plan. Within 30 days of receiving
the authorization from the Supervisors, the Township Engineer
shall file a report, in writing, with the Supervisors indicating
approval or rejection of the public improvements, either in whole or
in part, and in the case of rejection, shall provide a statement of the
reasons for such rejection. The Township Engineer shall also report
regarding completion of private improvements which have been
bonded in accordance with applicable ordinance requirements and
conditions of approval, if any.
D. Notification to Developer. Within 15 days of receipt of the Township
Engineer's report, the Township shall notify the developer, in
writing, by certified mail, of the action of the Supervisors with
relation to approval or rejection of the public improvements, as
well as the completion, in accordance with the specifications shown
on the approved plan, of any private improvements for which an
improvement security has been required.
E. Failure of Township to Comply. If the Supervisors or the Township
Engineer fails to comply with the time limitation provisions
contained in this chapter, all public and private improvements will
be deemed to have been approved, and the developer shall be
released from all liability pursuant to the improvement security
posted with the Township.
F. Completion of Rejected Improvements. If any portion of the public
or private improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected
by the Supervisors, the developer shall proceed to make the
required corrections or additions, and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, inspection and approval as outlined in
this chapter shall be followed.
G. Developer's Rights. Nothing in this chapter, however, shall be
construed to limit the developers right to contest or question, by
legal proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the
Supervisors or the Township Engineer.

96-266, 5/2/1996]
In the event that the public and private improvements required to be
installed by the provisions of this chapter are not installed in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter or the final plat prior to the expiration
of the improvement security, the Township shall have the power to enforce
the improvement security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies
provided by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If proceeds
from the improvement security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing
or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements guaranteed by
such improvement security, the Township may, at its option, install part
of the public improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land
development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to
recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the improvement
security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer,
or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements
guaranteed by such improvement security and not for any other municipal
purpose.

§ 22-314. Approval of Private Improvements. [Ord. 96-266, 5/2/
1996]
Approval of private improvements for which an improvement security has
been required and final release of that improvement security shall indicate
compliance with the specifications shown on the approved plan, however,
shall not imply approval by the Township of the method of construction or
structural integrity of the private improvements beyond that which is shown
on the approved plan, nor shall there be any liability associated with or
responsibility for maintenance of those improvements by the Township. The

1. The Township has determined that, in order to promote the best
interest of residents of the Township and individuals working in the
Township, adequate and usable recreation open space shall be provided
to serve the needs of the public at large. The Township's goals of
promoting and utilizing recreation open space are set forth at specific
length in the Township's Recreation Plan, as amended and updated. It is
acknowledged and recognized that both residential and nonresidential
uses of land in the Township create a demand for facilities which
require and utilize recreation open space. Nonresidential development,
whether stand-alone or part of a mixed-use development, creates its
own demands for usable recreation open space as individuals employed
in the Township couple their work activities with nonwork recreational
activities within the Township. As a result of nonresidential
development, there is also an influx of business invitees and others who,
due to the proximity and availability of Township recreation open space
facilities, utilize and will in the future utilize recreation open space
facilities. It is a vital Township objective to ensure that as residential
and nonresidential development continue, usable and adequate
§ 22-503 CRANBERRY CODE § 22-504
1:616
recreation open space which meets the Township's open space design
standards is developed and that existing facilities located within
recreation open space are maintained and upgraded as needed.
2. As a condition precedent to final approval of any subdivision or land
development intended for residential use, except those of five or fewer
dwelling units or lots, the developer shall dedicate for public use
recreation open space meeting the design standards in §§ 22-616 and
22-308.4 of this chapter, or upon agreement with the Township, pay a
recreation fee (§ 22-308.4).
3. As a condition precedent to final approval of any land development
intended for nonresidential use, the developer shall dedicate for public
use recreation open space meeting the design standards in §§ 22-616
and 22-308.4 of this chapter, or upon agreement with the Township, pay
a recreation fee (§ 22-308.4).
4. The nonresidential recreation fees or dedication of land in lieu of fee set
forth in this chapter shall not apply to de minimus nonresidential
development. "De minimus" nonresidential development shall be
defined as construction of a nonresidential building of 1,500 square feet
or less of gross floor area.
A. In addition, the nonresidential recreation fees or dedication of land
in lieu of fee set forth in this chapter shall not apply to public
schools, or buildings associated therewith, or to the Township of
Cranberry, any authority created by the Township or any other
Township agency, on the basis that schools and local government
agencies serve an overriding public interest which warrants an
exemption from nonresidential recreation fees or donation of land.
B. Finally, the Township has established this nonresidential recreation
fee/dedication of land requirement with the intent to promote the
retention and utilization of recreation open space within the
Township for use by Township residents and individuals employed
in or visiting the Township. The amount of the applicable fee or
dedication requirement corresponds to the square footage of the
relevant nonresidential development and should bear a reasonable
relationship to the typical expected increase in employee and
business invitee traffic within the Township and reduction of
available recreation space within the Township. In the event that
the Township staff determines, in its sole discretion, that
application of the nonresidential recreation fee or dedication of
land requirement would be grossly disproportionate to the impact
of a nonresidential development and in violation of applicable
Pennsylvania law, the Township's staff shall be empowered to
recommend any modification it deems necessary to carry out the
intent of this chapter.

Ord. 2005-362, 12/15/2005]
1. Any application for development shall conform to the principles and
standards of design set forth in this chapter.
2. The standards specified in the chapter are minimum design
requirements.
1. Preservation Required. Existing natural features such as trees, steep
slopes, watercourses and historic spots shall be preserved as a
conservation measure except to the extent that their removal or
modification is functionally related to the harmonious design of the
subdivision or land development.
2. Steep Slope Disturbance. The maximum percentage of lot area or site
area of a residential subdivision or planned residential development by
the following slope categories which may be disturbed, graded, and
stripped of vegetation during development and construction of the
public and private improvements is as follows:
A. If the slope category is 15% to 24.9% slope, 30% of the lot area or
site area.
B. If the slope category is greater than 25% slope, 15% of the lot area
or site area.
C. However, this restriction shall not apply to individual single-family
lot development, recreation open space, and site development for
the nonresidential portion of a PRD, but the restrictions shall apply
to general development sites for residential uses, i.e., streets,
utilities, etc.

direct vehicle access to an arterial or collector street unless specifically
approved by the supervisors when no alternative is possible. Normally,
only one street, driveway or point of vehicle access shall be permitted
from a subdivision onto an arterial or collector street; however, two or
more streets, driveways or points of vehicle access may be permitted if
they will improve the traffic circulation and safety in the area.
5. Large-Lot Subdivisions. When a tract is subdivided into lots larger than
the required building lots and there is no covenant preventing
resubdivision of the lots, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to
permit a logical location and opening of future streets and
resubdividing with provision for adequate utility connections for each
subdivision.
6. Lot Arrangement. The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all
lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly
related to topography and the character of surrounding development
with the minimum possible disturbance to the site.
7. Double-Frontage Lots. Double-frontage lots shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from
traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation.
8. Remnant Parcels. No remnants of land which are not buildable in
accordance with the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27], shall be
permitted. All portions of a plan shall be incorporated into existing or
proposed lots unless special usage is applied as part of a land
development proposal.

that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good
faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the
ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
district judge. Thereafter, each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.

per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of a violation and

calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. The
exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all of the
employees last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the

the calendar year under Subsection 2A, the employer shall
withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The
employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period
after receipt of the notification under Subsection 2A, a lump sum
equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person
due to the exemption claimed by the person under this subsection,
plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The
amount of the tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount
withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of
a person subject to withholding of the tax under this clause is
subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall be
liable for any outstanding balance of tax due and the Township may
pursue collection under this Part.
3. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the tax pursuant to
§ 24-203.1A or B shall annually file an exemption certificate with the
Townships Collector and with the persons employer affirming that the
person meets the requirements for an active duty exemption or a
military disability exemption. The exemption certificate shall have

the employee to active duty status if the exemption is requested under
§ 24-203.1B or the employees military discharge orders and
determination of one-hundred-percent permanent disability by the
United States Veterans Administration if the exemption is required
under § 24-203.1A. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until
otherwise instructed by the Township the employer shall not withhold
the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of
the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily
available to employes at all times and shall furnish each new employe
with a form at the time of hiring.
4. Refunds. The Collector shall establish procedures for the processing of
refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for
exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the
general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest
on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or
75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for
the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be
subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.

Income Tax Ordinance of the Township shall, within 15 days after the
§ 24-203 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 24-204

this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee
is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such
services are performed within the Township.
3. Any employer who discontinues business or ceases operation shall,
within 15 days after discontinuing business or ceasing operation, file
the return herein above required and pay the tax to the Collector.
4. The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the
employee from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. Any employer
who fails to deduct the tax as required by this Part or who fails to pay
such tax to the Collector shall be liable for such tax in full, without
deduction of the fee hereinafter provided, as though the tax had
originally been levied against such employer; provided that no
employer shall be held liable to the Township if the failure to withhold
taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to
the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal
office or where the employee is principally employed; and; provided,
further, that an employer shall not be liable for payment of the tax in an
amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer
complies with the provisions of §§ 24-203.2 and .3 and 24-204.5 and .6
herein.
5. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed a pro rata share of the tax
for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation. Assessment of the tax shall be made on a payroll period
basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation, except as provided in Subsection 6. The pro rata share of
the tax assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined
by dividing the rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the
number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar
year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall
round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the
nearest 1/100 of a dollar. The situs of the tax shall be the place of
employment on the first day the person becomes subject to the tax
during each payroll period.
6. In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from withholding the
tax, if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal
employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from
the employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal

situated in the Township of Cranberry to the total property or assets of
the taxpayer wherever owned and situated, or any other method or

his tax for such tax or license year and shall pay for such tax or license
year in an amount to be computed by multiplying his gross receipts or
volume of business for the preceding full calendar year by a fraction

The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,

shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer then the tax levied by Cranberry Township under the authority
of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax exists,
except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be one-half of the rate, and
such one-half rate shall become effective without any action on the part
of Cranberry Township; provided, however, that the Cranberry
Township and any other political subdivision which impose such tax on
the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to one-half of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
4. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

A. A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu

confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
E. A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
covenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,

transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce; between parent

spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal

granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
I. A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a
beneficiary of an ordinary trust.

K. A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this part. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this subsection.

agriculture and only if the agency or authority has the full
ownership interest in the real estate transferred.
P. A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a

is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.

may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation of the
reason such document is not subject to tax under this part.
1. A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change
does not affect the continuity of the company and of itself or together
with prior changes has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
2. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or

access easement for proposed parking areas and driveways
guaranteeing access to all abutting lots that are within a
nonresidential zoning district where such easements enhance
traffic circulation and connectivity. In addition, this easement
shall provide for the construction of the interconnection
between the development's proposed parking area and any
parking area on adjacent lots.

easement agreement between the owners and operators of the
facilities generating the need for common shared parking lots.
B. Any modification to the required number of parking spaces shall be
supported by a parking needs analysis documenting anticipated
parking needs based on the combined utilization of all facilities on
site simultaneously or demonstrating that the hours or days of peak
parking needed for the uses are so different that a lower total will
adequately provide for all uses served by the facility. The parking
needs analysis shall be prepared by a person or firm trained or
certified to perform such studies.
10. The required off-street parking spaces for any number of separate
buildings, structures or uses may be provided collectively on one lot,
provided that the total number of such spaces shall not be less than the
sum of the requirements for the various individual buildings, structures
or uses computed separately in accordance with this section. On
development sites where a combination of large-scale assembly uses
requiring parking for 2,000 vehicles or more, including at least one
commercial recreation use, are permitted, parking requirements may
be met for each use through a reciprocal parking and access easement
agreement between the owners and operators of the facilities
generating the need for such parking. In such cases, at the Supervisors'
discretion, each facility shall provide on site a minimum of 50% of the
required number of off street parking spaces determined at peak
utilization for each use. A parking needs analysis shall be submitted to
the Township which documents anticipated parking needs based on the
combined utilization of all facilities on site simultaneously. Said analysis
shall be prepared by a person or firm trained or certified to perform
such studies.

structure, off-street parking spaces equal in number to the sum of the
separate requirements for each use shall be provided.
12. All off-street parking lots required by this section shall be used only for
the parking of vehicles of occupants, patrons, visitors, or employees
and shall not be used for any kind of loading, sales, servicing or
continuous storage of a vehicle for more than 48 hours.
13. Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public or private off-street
parking lot capable of accommodating five or more vehicles shall be
developed and maintained in accordance with the following
requirements:
A. Each off-street parking space shall have direct access to an aisle or
driveway, and all off-street parking lots shall have vehicular access
§ 27-312 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-312
1:747
to a street so designed to minimize interference with pedestrian
and traffic movement.
B. All off-street parking lots including loading areas and service areas,
shall be paved with asphalt or concrete.

A. Objectives.
(1) Allow pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use developments, providing
shopping, employment, business and personal services.
(2) Promote an efficient, compact land use pattern to promote
easy access among stores and services by pedestrians, to
shorten trips, to lessen dependence on the automobile, and to
promote utilization of existing public facilities.
(3) Encourage developments which produce a desirable
relationship between individual buildings, the circulation
systems, and adjacent areas.
(4) Require sites to be designed in a way that creates a compact,
clustered development pattern using a linear or main street
building layout and an interconnected grid street pattern.
(5) Minimize the number of access points along arterial and
collector streets to maintain the long-term mobility function of
the corridor and to improve service to adjacent properties.
(6) Create a district where the need to move traffic is balanced
with the need to accommodate pedestrians.

2012-425, 1/3/2012, § 3]
In addition to the zoning districts established in Part 4 and delineated on the
Zoning District Map, all areas containing or characterized by the features
listed hereunder are established as overlay districts in accordance with the
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.
§ 27-502. Overlay Zoning Maps. [Ord. 96-267, 5/2/1996]
The location of each overlay district is delineated on a map depicting that
overlay feature. These maps are adopted as a part of the Zoning District
Map.
§ 27-503. through § 27-505. (Reserved)118
A. Accuracy of Overlay Districts. Overlay districts may not include all land
or sites subject to the special features of the overlay district; and not all
land within the overlay district may actually contain the special or
limiting feature.
B. Areas Not Included in Overlay Districts. It is the intent of this chapter
that the limitations on development which are imposed by the overlay
district regulations shall apply to all parcels which include the
regulated feature, whether or not the land is shown in the overlay
district. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to establish the
presence or absence on the proposed site of all features subject to
regulation in this part.
C. Interpretation of Overlay Districts. If the Zoning District Map or list is
questioned, the burden of proof shall be upon the developer, who shall
submit information from a qualified professional or other expert
acceptable to the Township to demonstrate that the site in question can
be used in the manner proposed without violation of this chapter.

(b) Not less than the above-listed percentage of the site area
of the planned residential development shall be allocated
to and shall remain passive common open space in
perpetuity. Common open space shall be deed-restricted or
placed within a trust or conservancy, to prohibit future
subdivision or development, except for agricultural,
passive recreational, equestrian and existing cemetery
uses, which may be permitted with the approval of the
Supervisors. Common open spaces shall be used for social,
passive recreational and/or natural environment
preservation purposes. The common open space shall
typically include all or part of the following resources:
1) Mature woodlands.
§ 27-903 CRANBERRY CODE § 27-903
1:960
2) Historic, archaeological, or cultural features listed, or
eligible to be listed, on the National Register of
Historic Places.
3) Wetlands.
4) Identified floodplain area.
5) Slopes exceeding 25%.
B. General Locational and Design Standards.
(1) Planned residential developments shall be designed around the
common open space with areas being placed in undivided
preserve. Such areas shall be directly accessible to the largest
practicable number of lots within the development. Safe and
convenient pedestrian access to the open space shall be
provided for all lots not adjoining the open space areas.
(2) A perimeter buffer yard of a minimum of 50 feet in width shall
be provided. Such buffer yard may be used for agricultural
purposes or wood lots upon approval by the Supervisors. No
stormwater detention basins shall be located within the fiftyfoot
perimeter buffer yard.
(3) Common open space, particularly perimeter buffer yards,
containing existing attractive or unique natural features, such
as streams, creeks, ponds, woodlands, specimen trees and
other areas of mature vegetation worthy of preservation, may
be left unimproved and in a natural state. As a general
principle, the preservation of undeveloped open space in its
natural state or as existing farms is encouraged. A developer
may make certain improvements, such as the cutting of trails
for walking or jogging, and the provision of picnic areas.
(4) No streets, emergency access roads, driveways or existing
utility rights-of-way, easements, or improvements shall be
within the acreage designated for the minimum common open
space as required above, except as required as part of the
approved common open space.
(5) The common open space shall generally abut existing or
potential open space land on adjacent parcels and shall be
designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway
systems, as per the policies of the Cranberry Township
Recreation Study.163

NONCONFORMING LOTS, SIGNS, STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 27-1001. Intents and Purposes. [Ord. 96-267, 5/2/1996; as
amended by Ord. 97-284, 11/6/1997, § 38]
§ 27-1002. Nonconforming Lots. [Ord. 96-267, 5/2/1996]
1. If, within the zoning districts established by this chapter or due to
amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures or
uses of lots which were lawful before this chapter was passed or
amended but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this chapter or future amendments, it is the intent of this
chapter to permit those nonconformities. Such uses are declared by this
chapter to be incompatible with authorized uses in the zoning districts
involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended nor be used as
grounds for adding other signs, structures or uses prohibited elsewhere
in the same zoning district.
2. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
structure on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which
actual construction has been diligently commenced. "Actual
construction" is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner,
except that where demolition or removal of an existing structure has
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or
removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work
shall be diligently carried on until completion of the structure involved.
1. In any zoning district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single nonconforming lot if the lot is in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership (provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not
involving lot area or lot width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the zoning district in which such lot is located). This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for lot area or lot width, or both that are generally
applicable in the zoning district. Variation of yard requirements shall be
obtained only through action of the Board as provided for by § 27-1108,
procedure for variances.
2. If two or more nonconforming lots or combinations of lots and portions
of lots with continuous frontage are in single ownership, and if all or
part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and lot area
as established by this chapter, the lots involved shall be considered to
be an undivided lot for the purposes of this chapter. No portion of said

§ 27-1003. Nonconforming Uses of Lots. [Ord. 96-267, 5/2/1996; as
amended by Ord. 98-288, 3/26/1998, § 12]
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a
lawful use of a lot exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms
of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued as long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
§ 27-1004. Nonconforming Structures. [Ord. 96-267, 5/2/1996]
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the requirements
of this chapter, such structure may be continued as long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
undivided lot shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width
and lot area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any
division of the lot be made which leaves remaining any lot not meeting
the requirements of this chapter. Any division of said lot containing a
nonconforming use of a structure shall conform with the minimum lot
area requirements for authorized uses.
A. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended
to occupy a greater lot area than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless the Board shall interpret
that the enlargement or extension is necessary by the natural expansion
and growth of trade of the nonconforming use.
B. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot not occupied by such use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.
C. If any such nonconforming use of a lot ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 12 consecutive months, it shall be presumed that
the nonconforming use has been abandoned, and any subsequent use of
such lot shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for
the zoning district in which such lot is located.
A. No such structure may be enlarged or otherwise have any structural
alterations made to it in a way which increases its nonconformity,
except when the Board may determine undue hardship and may
authorize a reasonable modification of such structure.
B. Should such structure be destroyed by any means, repairs or
reconstruction may be undertaken, provided that such restoration is
started within 12 months of the date of damage.
C. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located.

1:964
§ 27-1005. Nonconforming Use of Structures. [Ord. 96-267, 5/2/
1996]
If a lawful use of a structure or of a structure and lot in combination exists
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would
not be allowed in the zoning district under the terms of this chapter, the
lawful use may be continued, subject to the following provisions:
D. In addition to the requirements of Chapter 8, Floodplain Ordinance,
structures existing in any identified floodplain area prior to the date of
adoption of restrictions in the identified floodplain area, i.e., Ord. No.
124 on March 25, 1982, may continue, provided that no expansion or
enlargement of any existing structure shall be allowed within any
identified floodway zoning district that would cause any increase in
flood heights. [Amended by Ord. No. 2018-485, 11/1/2018]
A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in
the zoning district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or otherwise have any structural
alterations made to it except in changing the use of the structure to an
authorized use in the zoning district in which it is located, unless the
Board shall interpret that the enlargement, extension, construction,
reconstruction or structural alteration is necessitated by the natural
expansion and growth of trade of the nonconforming use.
B. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
structure which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at
the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall
be extended to occupy any lot or portion of a lot outside such structure,
except on a lot or portion of a lot owned at the time the use became
nonconforming.
C. Any structure or structure and lot in combination in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by an authorized use shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such
structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be
resumed.
D. When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and lot in
combination ceases for a period of more than 12 consecutive months, it
shall be presumed that the nonconforming use has been abandoned,
and any subsequent use of such structure or structure and lot in
combination shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter
for the zoning district in which such lot is located.
E. Where nonconforming status applies to both the use and the structure
on the lot, removal or destruction of the nonconforming structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming use on the lot.

1:965
§ 27-1006. Repairs and Maintenance. [Ord. 96-267, 5/2/1996]
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the safety of the populace.
§ 27-1007. Uses Approved under Conditional Use, Use by Special
Exception or Planned Residential Development Provisions. [Ord.
96-267, 5/2/1996]
Any use for which a conditional use, use by special exception or planned
residential development is approved in accordance with Parts 7, 8, or 9, of
this chapter, shall not be deemed a nonconforming use but shall, without
further action, be deemed a conforming use in such zoning district.
§ 27-1008. Historical Landmarks. [Ord. 96-267, 5/2/1996; as
amended by Ord. No. 2010-403, 10/7/2010]
The provisions of this part shall not apply to any building or structure which
is designated by the Planning Advisory Commission, with concurrence of
the Supervisors, to be a historical landmark.
F. Nonconforming signs may be repaired or reconstructed, provided that
no structural alterations are made which increase the sign area
computed in accordance with § 27-603.3 of this chapter.
G. Nonconforming signs may not be enlarged, added to, or replaced by
another nonconforming sign, use or structure, except that interchange
of poster panels shall be permitted.

allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later than 30
days after an application for development, preliminary or final,

and proves that he had no notice, knowledge, or reason to
believe that such approval had been given. If such person has
succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be
bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The

within the period required, or fails to commence or complete the
required hearing within the time limitations, the decision shall be
deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the
applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of
time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant
because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as

landowner may apply for relief where it is alleged that the provisions of
this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant or upon
appeal from a decision of the Zoning Officer.
3. Findings Required. No variance shall be granted until the applicant has
established and the Board has made all of the following findings where
relevant in a given case:
§ 27-1107 CRANBERRY CODE § 27-1108
1:976
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
4. Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in
this chapter as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
chapter.
5. Expiration. A variance granted by the Board shall expire automatically
without written notice to the applicant if no application for a zoning
approval, building permit or grading permit to undertake the work
described in the decision granting the variance has been submitted
within 12 months of said decision, unless the Board, in its sole
discretion extends the variance upon written request of the applicant
received prior to its expiration or unless the Board specifically grants a
longer period of time in its decision. The maximum extension permitted
shall be one twelve-month extension. A variance granted by the Board
prior to the adoption of this section shall be subject to the provisions of
this section; however, the twelve-month period shall begin with the date
of adoption of this section.

purposes of this chapter.
4. If the Board determines that the application for special exception meets
all the requirements of this chapter and receives assurances that any
additional conditions deemed necessary shall be fulfilled and that the
application is in conformity with the spirit and intent of this chapter, it
shall direct the Zoning Officer of issue zoning approval for such special
exception.
5. Expiration. A special exception approval granted by the Board shall
expire automatically without written notice to the applicant if no
application for a zoning approval, building permit, or grading permit to
undertake the work described in the decision granting the special
exception has been submitted within 12 months of said decision, unless
