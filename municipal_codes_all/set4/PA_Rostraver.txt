Rostraver, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated March 17, 2011, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study.
B. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by the Township of Rostraver and
declared to be a part of this chapter
A. FW (floodway area): the areas identified as "floodway" in the AE Zone in
the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the FEMA. The term shall also
include floodway areas which have been identified in other available
studies or sources of information for those floodplain areas where no
floodway has been identified in the Flood Insurance Study.
B. FF (flood-fringe area): the remaining portions of the one-hundred-year
floodplain in those areas identified as an AE Zone in the Flood
Insurance Study, where floodway has been delineated. The basis for this
outermost boundary of this area shall be the one-hundred-year-flood
elevations as shown in the flood profiles contained in the Flood
Insurance Study.
C. FE (special floodplain area): the areas identified as Zone AE in the
Flood Insurance Study, where one-hundred-year-flood elevations have
been provided, but no floodway has been delineated.
D. FA (general floodplain area): the areas identified as Zone A in the FIS
for which no one-hundred-year-flood elevations have been provided.
When available, information from other federal, state and other
acceptable sources shall be used to determine the one-hundred-year
elevation, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the one-hundred-year elevation shall be
determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site in question. In lieu of the
above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the
elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently

business entity to perform energy source operations on Township property
or any other property, private or public. Furthermore, this article shall
not be construed as conferring the legal right to perform energy source
operations as described herein on private property, and the issuance of a
permit pursuant to this article does not concomitantly confer any right to
perform energy source operations on such property. This article neither
expands nor limits the requirements for energy source operations on private
representatives' operations under this permit, including attorneys' fees,
and any other costs and expenses incurred by the Township in
defending against any such claims, demands, and causes of action.
Within 30 days of receipt of same, the applicant shall notify the

Township's discretion, the Township may conduct an independent
investigation, monitor, and review the processing of any such claim to
ensure that such claim is handled as required herein.
D. Any permit granted hereunder may be revoked upon breach of any term
or condition contained herein.
E. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any permit
granted hereunder shall not be effective unless and until a copy of the
permit, signed by an authorized officer of the applicant, the
performance bond, and the certificates of insurance have been filed
with the Township Secretary.

article shall not be construed as rendering on behalf of the Township
any statement, assertion, warranty or guarantee concerning the scope,
methods, and/or safety of energy source operations by any individual,
group, or entity permitted by the Board of Commissioners under this article.
Accordingly, the Township shall not, as a result of any decision to grant or
deny any permit under this article, be held liable for any harm directly or
indirectly related to energy source operations performed in the Township.

of gross sales or any other method which will assure that the fee
assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like

each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales and pay
the amount of fee therefor, provided that no additional fee during any
one calendar year shall be required after the licensee shall have been

This article shall be hereafter known as the "Rostraver Township Grease
Remediation Ordinance."
§ 155-36. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF GREASE  Discharge concentrations exceeding
100 parts per million (ppm) of grease, oil and fat downstream of an
interceptor or trap.
FOOD PREPARATION FACILITY  Any food establishment in any building,
room or place or any portion thereof or appurtenance thereto, where human
food or drink is mixed, cooked or otherwise prepared, offered for sale, sold,
served or given with or without charge to patrons, customers or guests for
consumption on the premises; provided, however, that this does not include
the mixing, cooking or other preparation of serving of food in single-family
dwellings to the resident family or its guest.
GREASE INTERCEPTOR  An interceptor whose rated flow exceeds 35
gallons per minute (gpm) and which is located underground outside the
building.

which is located inside the building. Grease traps shall be rated for a
minimum 22.5 gpm.
RESTAURANT  Any public eating place where meals are prepared, offered
for sale, sold and served to patrons, customers or guests for compensation
based on the price charged for and generally paid at the conclusion of each
meal. The words "meals," as used herein, means meals generally consisting
of courses embracing some kind of meat or its equivalent, vegetables,
bread, pastry, beverages and accompaniments.
§ 155-37. Plumbing to be in good repair.

§ 155-38. Grease traps and grease interceptors required.
§ 155-39. Installation of grease interceptors and traps.
A. On or before June 1, 1999, every building, room or space or part thereof
used as a restaurant or food preparation facility, whether new or
existing, shall install or cause to be installed a grease interceptor or
grease trap. The type of installation shall be determined by the total
fixture flow-through rate of potential grease laden fixtures discharging
through the building sewage lines as determined by the Rostraver
Township Sewage Authority. For flow-through rates 35 gpm or less, an
internal grease trap may be installed in certain existing structures used
as restaurants and food preparation facilities. For flow-through rates
exceeding 35 gpm, an external underground grease interceptor must
be installed in all new structures or changes of use involving

C. In all existing restaurants or food preparation facilities, there shall be
installed a grease interceptor or grease trap as determined by flowthrough
rate, as detailed above. In existing facilities where it is
determined by Rostraver Township that a grease trap is not sufficient,
Rostraver Township or its responsible agent or assigns may require that
a grease interceptor (as detailed above) be installed. Such insufficiency
shall be evidenced by excessive amounts of grease being discharged
into the public sewer system by a facility. All existing restaurants or
food preparation facilities shall, at a change of ownership or alteration,

interceptor, minimum one-thousand-gallon capacity, regardless of flowthrough
rate. Each grease interceptor or grease trap shall and must be
installed by a plumber registered width the Westmoreland County
Plumbing Department.

location along the sewer line between the restaurant and/or food
preparation facility and the lines entry into the main public sewer line.
An inspection site tee shall be installed between the interceptor
discharge and connect to the public sewer system. All installations shall
be in accordance with Rostraver Township Sewage Authority Rules and
Regulations.
B. No solid waste device, such as waste grinders, disposal, potato peelers,
etc., shall discharge through the grease trap or grease interceptor. Only
potential grease laden fixtures may discharge through the trap or
interceptor.

exceeding those permitted by the Rostraver Township Sewage
Authority. Oil/grease discharges shall not exceed 100 ppm downstream
of the interceptor or trap.
B. It shall be the duty and responsibility of any owner, lessee or agent of

the name (inspector and company), address, phone number of the
inspection/disposal company, the method and frequency of cleaning
schedule and the date of the cleaning/inspection. Such records shall be
presented to the municipality upon request. A more frequent cleaning/
inspection schedule may be ordered to be performed by the facility
when it is determined by the municipality that the facility is discharging
excessive amounts of grease to the public sewer system.
C. Rostraver Township Sewage Authority has the authorization to request
random samplings for the testing of grease traps in restaurants and
food preparation facilities. Said testing shall require the grease trap
samples to be sent to a laboratory. It shall be the responsibility of any
owner, lessee or agent of any restaurant or food preparation facility
who fails the laboratory analysis involved with the grease-trap testing
to pay the administrative costs that the Rostraver Township Sewage
Authority incurred as a result of the test. Said administrative cost shall
be in addition to any other fines or penalties that may be assessed in
accordance with this article. [Added 12-4-2002 by Ord. No. 476]

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 164-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Rostraver Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance.
§ 164-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the Rostraver Township finds that:
A. Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing increased runoff flows and
velocities, which overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams
and storm sewers, and greatly increases the cost of public facilities to
convey and manage stormwater.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of
streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
C. These impacts happen mainly through a decrease in natural infiltration
of stormwater.
D. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and other activities causing loss
of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
welfare, and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the
people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a federal permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.
§ 164-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 164-3
1:181
§ 164-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Rostraver Township and its watersheds by minimizing the damages
described in § 164-1 of this chapter, through provisions designed to:
§ 164-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
stormwater runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No.
247, the Municipalities Planning Code,37 as amended, and Act of October
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause these problems.
B. Provide review procedures, performance standards and design criteria
for stormwater planning and management for both new and
redeveloped sites.
C. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
D. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
E. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to prevent degradation of surface
and ground water quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the
municipality and commonwealth.
G. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those
uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special
protection streams.
H. Prevent stream bank and streambed scour and erosion.
I. Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities that are constructed in the
municipality.
J. Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES
permit requirements.
K. Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to
address nonstormwater discharges into the municipalitys separate
storm sewer system.
L. To provide Rostraver Township with a workable set of performance
standards that may be revised with new and improved stormwater
management practices.
§ 164-3 ROSTRAVER CODE § 164-4
1:182
4, 1978, P.L. 864, Act 167, the Storm Water Management Act,38 and the
appropriate municipal code.
§ 164-5. Applicability.
A. This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan and land
development applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a
waiver by the Township of Rostraver under the specifications of Article
IV, § 164-30 of this chapter. The chapter also applies to land
development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability
criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development
activities may take place at different times on different schedules. In
addition, all plans must be reviewed by Westmoreland County
Conservation District officials to ensure that established water quality
standards will be maintained during and after development of the site
and that postconstruction runoff levels are consistent with any local and
regional watershed plans.
B. To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the Township of
Rostraver has developed a set of performance standards that must be
met at new development sites. These standards apply to any
construction activity disturbing 5,000 or more square feet of land. The
following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance
criteria:
(1) Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan
prepared or approved by Westmoreland County Conservation
District, as applicable.
(2) Additions or modifications to existing single-family structures less
than 1,000 square feet.
(3) Developments that do not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of
land, and do not create more than 1,000 square feet of impervious
surface, provided that they are not part of a larger common
development plan.
(4) Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary
by the Township of Rostraver.
C. When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in Article II of this chapter, decisions
on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed
by stormwater sizing criteria found in the current chapter. This criteria
is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the
redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all

§ 164-6. Repealer.
Any ordinance or ordinance provision of the municipality inconsistent with
any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
§ 164-7. Severability.
In the event that any section or provision of this chapter is declared invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the
validity of any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 164-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the
Township of Rostraver.
A. Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter to do not relieve
the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or
ordinance. To the extent that this chapter imposes more rigorous
requirements for stormwater management, the specific requirements
contained in this chapter shall be followed.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any of the
municipalitys requirements regarding stormwater matters which do
not interfere with the provisions of this chapter, such as local
stormwater management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type,
collection system design and details, outlet structure design, etc.).

93. These uses must be protected and maintained, under state
regulations.
A.
Existing uses are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Land development
must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses and maintain
the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After land development, these
characteristics can be impacted by addition of pollutants such as
sediment, and changes in habitat through increased flow volumes and/
or rates. Therefore, discharges to surface waters must be designed
and managed to protect the stream bank, streambed and structural
integrity of the waterway, to prevent these impacts.

Stormwater Management Requirements
§ 164-11. General requirements.
§ 164-12. Permit requirements by other governmental entities.
[Amended 7-7-2004 by Ord. No. 514]
The following permit requirements apply to certain land development
activities and must be met prior to municipal approval of subdivision
approval or land development plans, or issuance of zoning or occupancy
permits, where applicable:
A. All land development within the municipality shall be designed,
implemented, operated and maintained to meet the purposes of this
chapter through these two elements:
(1) Erosion and sediment control prevention during land development
(e.g., earth disturbance during construction); and
(2) Water quality protection measures after completion of land
development (e.g., postconstruction).
B. No approval of any subdivision or land development plans, or issuance
of any zoning permit or occupancy permit, or the commencement of any
earth disturbance at a project site within the municipality, shall proceed
until the requirements of this chapter are met, including approval of a
project plan under § 164-23 and a permit under PADEP regulations,
where applicable. [Added 7-7-2004 by Ord. No. 514]
C. Erosion and sediment control during land development shall be
addressed as required by § 164-14.
D. Water quality protection shall be addressed as required by § 164-15.
E. All best management practices (BMPs) used to meet the requirements
of this chapter shall conform to the design criteria contained in
§ 164-17 and shall use the calculation methods as described in § 164-18.
F. Techniques described in Appendix C (Low Impact Development)40 are
encouraged because they reduce the costs of complying with the
requirements of this chapter and the state water quality requirements.
G. The fee for review of any land development application shall be based
on the amount of land to be disturbed at the site, and the fee schedule
shall be established by the Township of Rostraver. All of the monetary
contributions shall be credited to a local budgetary category to support
local plan review, inspection and program administration, and shall be
made prior to the issuance of any zoning permit for the development.

§ 164-13. Approved stormwater management project plan required.
§ 164-14. Erosion and sediment control during land development.
A. All earth disturbance activities subject to standards and possible permit
requirements by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
B. Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by PADEP under 25
Pa. Code Chapter 105.
C. Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or
adjacent to surface waters of the commonwealth, including wetlands,
subject to permit by PADEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
D. Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a state
highway right-of-way subject to approval by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
E. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
105.
A. Any person conducting any new land development activities or
redevelopment activities creating an impervious area of 1,000 square
feet or greater in the municipality or involving earth disturbance of
5,000 square feet or greater, shall submit and obtain approval from the
municipality of a project plan meeting the requirements of this chapter,
prior to commencing the activity.
B. The project plan shall describe the BMPs for erosion and sediment
control, and the postconstruction BMPs for water quality protection.
C. The project plan shall follow the design criteria and calculation
methodology contained in §§ 164-17 and 164-18 respectively.
D. The requirements in this section apply to the total land development
project, even if it is to take place in stages.
E. All redevelopment projects over 1,000 square feet shall evaluate the
feasibility of reducing site impervious area by at least 20%. Where
project site conditions prevent the reduction of impervious area, then
stormwater BMPs shall be evaluated to provide qualitative controls for
at least 20% of the sites impervious area.
A. Earth disturbance activities of 5,000 square feet or greater require
design, implementation and maintenance of erosion and sediment
control BMPs that control erosion and prevent sediment pollution
during the earth disturbance activities.
B. The BMPs shall be identified in a plan, and a permit, if applicable, as
required by PADEP regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.

1:192
§ 164-15. Water quality requirements after land development is
complete.
C. The local county conservation districts are frequently delegated the
authority to issue permits and other approvals by PADEP. Evidence of
any necessary permits for the earth disturbance activities from the
appropriate PADEP regional office, or the local county conservation
district office if delegated by DEP, must be provided to the municipality.
D. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
A. The project plan shall specify permanent stormwater BMPs to be
implemented, operated and maintained to meet legal water quality
requirements. Because water quality requirements vary depending on
the uses of the water bodies in the watershed, a framework
methodology is provided here.
B. In order to protect and maintain water quality, additional stormwater
runoff created by the development project must be captured, stored and
treated. In addition, postconstruction stormwater infiltration of runoff
must replicate preconstruction infiltration of runoff to the maximum
extent possible, in high quality and exceptional value watersheds,
special requirements may apply.
C. The volume of additional stormwater runoff to be captured, stored and
treated is called the water quality volume (WQv).
(1) The formula for determining WQv is:
WQv = [(P) (Rv) (A)]/12], where:
P = Rainfall depth in inches, using the ninety-percent-storm, the
volume of rainfall for 90% of the storm events which produce
runoff in the watershed annually (e.g., 1.0 inches). (See Appendix
A.41)
A = Project area in acres
Rv = Volumetric runoff coefficient [0.05 + 0.009(I)], where I is
the impervious surface percentage (impervious area ÷ total
project area) x 100%
(2) In special protection watersheds, as described in 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93, this volume may be required to remain on site through
infiltration and other methods, to protect water quality. Guidance
can be obtained from PADEP.
(3) Runoff treatment BMPs must be employed where necessary to
ensure the water quality requirements are met.
41.Editors Note: Appendix A is on file in the Township offices.
§ 164-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 164-15
1:193
(4) Design systems that are capable of removing 80% TSS and 40% TP
removal.
D. Water temperature is a particular concern in high quality and
exceptional value watersheds. Temperature sensitive BMPs and
stormwater conveyance systems are to be used and designed with
storage pool areas and supply outflow channels, and should be shaded
with trees. Vegetation shall be planted within the facilities, provided
that capacity for volumes and rate control as required by this chapter is
maintained.
(1) At a minimum, the southern half on pond shorelines shall be
planted with shade or canopy trees within 10 feet of the pond
shoreline.
(2) In conjunction with this requirement, the maximum slope allowed
on the berm area to be planted is 10 to one. This will lessen the
destabilization of berm soils due to root growth.
(3) A long-term maintenance schedule and management plan for the
thermal control BMPs is to be established and recorded for all
development project sites.
E. The applicant may, subject to approval of the municipality, use any of
the following stormwater credits, described in the following table, in
computing the required water quality volume:
Stormwater Credit Description
Natural area conservation Conservation of natural areas, such as
forest, wetlands, or other sensitive
areas in a protected easement,
thereby retaining their
predevelopment hydrologic and water
quality characteristics. Using this
credit, a designer may subtract
conservation areas from total site area
when computing the required water
quality volume.
Disconnection of rooftop
runoff
Credit is given when rooftop runoff is
disconnected and then directed over a
pervious area where it may either
infiltrate into the soil or filter over it.
Credit is typically obtained by grading
the site to promote overland flow or by
providing bioretention on single-family
residential lots. If a rooftop area is
adequately disconnected, the
impervious area may be deducted
from the total impervious cover.
§ 164-15 ROSTRAVER CODE § 164-15
1:194
§ 164-16. Infiltration.
Stormwater Credit Description
Disconnection of non-rooftop
runoff
Credit is given for practices that
disconnect surface impervious cover
by directing it to pervious areas where
it is either infiltrated or filtered
through the soil. As with rooftop
runoff, the impervious area may be
deducted from the total impervious
cover thereby reducing the required
water quality volume.
Stream buffer credit Credit is given when a stream buffer
effectively treats stormwater runoff.
Effective treatment constitutes
capturing runoff from pervious and
impervious areas adjacent to the
buffer and treating the runoff through
overland flow across a grass or
forested area. Areas treated in this
manner may be deducted from total
site area.
Grass channel (open section
roads)
Credit may be given when open grass
channels are used to reduce the
volume of runoff and pollutants during
smaller storms. If designed according
to appropriate criteria, these channels
may meet water quality criteria for
certain types of residential
development.
Environmentally sensitive
rural development
Credit is given when a group of
environmental site design techniques
are applied to low-density or rural
residential development. This credit
eliminates the need for structural
practices to address water quality
volume. See Appendix C.42
F. The volume and rate of any stormwater discharges allowed under this
chapter must be managed to prevent the physical degradation of
receiving waters, such as by stream bank scour and erosion. If a
detention facility is proposed which is part of the BMPs approved for
the project, the facility (ies) must be designed to provide for a twentyfour-
hour extended detention of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm
event (i.e., the stormwater runoff will be released over a minimum 24
hours for the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm event).
42.Editors Note: Appendix C is on file in the Township offices.
§ 164-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 164-16
1:195
A. Prevention of stormwater runoff is a key objective of Chapter 93 of the
DEP regulations, because runoff can change the physical, chemical and
biological integrity of water bodies thereby impacting water quality.
B. The project plan shall describe how these water quality protection
requirements will be met. Infiltration BMPs shall be evaluated and
utilized to the maximum extent possible to manage the net change in
stormwater runoff generated so that postconstruction discharges do
not degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the
receiving waters. These BMPs may be used to satisfy all or part of the
requirements in § 164-15.
C. Postconstruction stormwater infiltration of runoff shall replicate
preconstruction infiltration of runoff to the maximum extent possible. In
high quality and exceptional value watersheds, special requirements
may apply. Guidance is available from PADEP.
D. In calculating the volume of runoff that can be infiltrated at a site, the
following methodology shall be used:
(1) Methodology:
(a) Recharge volume calculation.
Rev = [(S)(Rv)(A)]/12, where:
Rev = Recharge volume (acre-feet)
S = Soil specific recharge factor (inches)
A = Site area contributing to the recharge facility (acres)
Rv = Volumetric runoff coefficient, Rv = 0.05 + 0.009 (I),
where I = percent impervious area; and
S shall be obtained based upon hydrologic soil group based
upon the table below:
Hydrologic Soil Group Soil Specific Recharge Factor
(S)
A 0.38
B 0.25
C 0.13
D 0.06
(b) If more than one hydrologic soil group (HSG) is present at a
site, a composite recharge volume shall be computed based
upon the proportion of total site area within each HSG.
(2) In selecting the appropriate infiltration BMPs, the applicant shall
consider the following:
§ 164-16 ROSTRAVER CODE § 164-16
1:196
(a) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(b) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(c) Seasonal high-water table.
(d) Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
(e) Erodibility of soils
(f) Land availability and topography
(3) A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of infiltration BMPs. The evaluation shall
be performed by a qualified professional and, at a minimum,
address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to
sinkhole formation, and subgrade stability. The general process for
designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
(a) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the watershed to determine general
areas of suitability for infiltration BMPs.
(b) Provide field-testing data to determine appropriate percolation
rate and/or hydraulic conductivity.
(c) Design infiltration BMPs for required stormwater volume
based on field-determined capacity at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface.
(4) Soil characteristics: subject to the specific considerations in
Subsection D(7) below:
(a) Infiltration BMPs are particularly appropriate in hydrologic soil
Groups A and B, as described in the Natural Resources
Conservation Service Manual TR-55.
(b) Low-erodibility factors (K factors) are preferred for the
construction of basins.
(c) There must be a minimum depth of 48 inches between the
bottom of any facility and the seasonal high-water table and/or
bedrock (limiting zones), except for infiltration BMPs receiving
only roof runoff which shall be placed in soils having a
minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the facility
and the limiting zone.
(d) There must be an infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient
to accept the additional stormwater load, and to drain
completely as determined by field tests.
(e) Infiltration BMPs shall be located a minimum of 10 feet away
from the foundation wall of any building.
§ 164-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 164-16
1:197
(f) The infiltration system shall have positive overflow controls to
prevent storage within one foot of the finished surface or
grade.
(g) Infiltration rates shall not be used in computing the storage
volume of the infiltration system.
(h) Surface inflows shall be designed to prevent direct discharge
of sediment into the infiltration system.
(5) The recharge volume provided at the site shall be directed to the
most permeable HSG available, except where other considerations
apply, such as in limestone geology.
(6) Any infiltration BMP shall be capable of completely infiltrating the
impounded water within 48 hours.
(7) Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as:
(a) Strip mines;
(b) Where salt or chloride may be applied in deicing and other
winter applications, causing groundwater pollution since soils
do little to filter this pollutant; and
(c) Limestone areas:
[1] Whenever a basin will be located in an area underlain by
limestone, geological evaluation of the proposed location
shall be conducted to determine susceptibility to sinkhole
formations.
[2] The design of all BMPs over limestone formations shall
include measures to prevent groundwater contamination
and, where necessary, sinkhole formation.
[3] It shall be the applicants responsibility to verify whether
the site is underlain by limestone.
[4] The following note shall be attached to all drainage plans
and signed and sealed by the applicants licensed
engineer/surveyor or landscape/architect or geologist if a
detention facility is proposed: I certify that the proposed
facility is/is not underlain by limestone.
(8) During the period of land disturbance, runoff shall be controlled
prior to entering any proposed infiltration area. Areas proposed for
infiltration BMPs shall be protected from sedimentation and
compaction during the construction phase, so as to maintain their
maximum infiltration capacity.
§ 164-16 ROSTRAVER CODE § 164-16
1:198
§ 164-17. Design criteria for stormwater management BMPs.
(9) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
received final stabilization.
A. Applicants may select a combination of runoff control techniques which
are most suitable to control stormwater runoff from the site. All
controls shall be subject to approval of the Municipal Engineer. The
Municipal Engineer may request specific information on design and/or
operating features of the proposed stormwater controls in order to
determine their suitability and adequacy in terms of the standards of
this section.
B. The applicant shall consider the effect of the proposed stormwater
management techniques on any special soil condition or geological
hazards which may exist on the development site. In the event such

of any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation technique,
which shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent with the volume
from a method that produces a full hydrograph.
J. The municipality may require that computed existing runoff rates be
reconciled with field observations and conditions. If the design
professional can substantiate through actual physical calibration that
more appropriate runoff and time-of-concentration values should be
utilized at a particular site, then appropriate variations may be made
upon review and recommendations of the Municipal Engineer.

A. A stormwater hotspot is defined as a land use or activity that
generates higher concentrations of hydrocarbons, trace metals or
toxicants than are found in typical stormwater runoff, based on
monitoring studies. If a site is designated as a hotspot, it has
important implications for how stormwater is managed. First and
foremost, stormwater runoff from hotspots cannot be allowed to
infiltrate into groundwater, where it may contaminate water supplies.
Second, a greater level of stormwater treatment is needed at hotspot
sites to prevent pollutant washoff after construction. This treatment
§ 164-18 ROSTRAVER CODE § 164-19
1:202
plan typically involves preparing and implementing a stormwater
pollution prevention plan that involves a series of operational practices
at the site that reduces the generation of pollutants from a site or
prevent contact of rainfall with the pollutants. Table 3.2 provides a list
of designated hotspots for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. Under EPAs stormwater NPDES program, some industrial sites are
required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention
plan. A list of industrial categories that are subject to the pollution
prevention requirement can be found in the commonwealth. In
addition, Pennsylvania requirements for preparing and implementing a
stormwater pollution prevention plan are described in the NPDES
general discharge permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan
requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
Table 3.2 Classification of Stormwater Hotspots
The following land uses and activities are deemed stormwater
hotspots:
Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities
Vehicle fueling stations
Vehicle service and maintenance facilities
Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities
Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.)
Industrial sites (based on SIC codes)
Marinas (service and maintenance)
Outdoor liquid container storage
Outdoor loading/unloading facilities
Public works storage areas
Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials
Commercial container nursery
Other land uses and activities as designated by an appropriate review
authority
C. The following land uses and activities are not normally considered
hotspots:
(1) Residential streets and rural highways.
(2) Residential development.

(6) Pervious areas, except golf courses and nurseries [which may need
an integrated pest management (IPM) plan].
D. While large highways [average daily traffic volume (ADT) greater than
30,000] are not designated as a stormwater hotspot, it is important to
ensure that highway stormwater management plans adequately protect
groundwater.
A. Method of computation. Peak discharge and runoff shall be computed
using those methods listed in § 164-18.
B. Rainfall frequency data: as listed in Appendix A.48
C. Maintenance of natural drainageways. All natural streams, channels,
swales, drainage systems and/or areas of surface water concentration
shall be maintained in their existing condition unless an alteration is
approved by the municipality. All encroachment activities shall comply
with the requirements of Chapter 105 (Water Obstructions and
Encroachments) of Title 25, Rules and Regulations of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources. The applicant must refer to
Rostraver Township Zoning Ordinance, § 195-70, in regard to any
disturbance within 50 feet of a stream.
D. Methods of stormwater runoff detention and control. The following is a
listing of detention and control methods which may be utilized in
stormwater management systems, if appropriate. The choice of control
techniques is not limited to the ones appearing on this list.
(1) Detention basins (extended dry ponds for all Township-owned
facilities).
(2) Rooftop storage.
(3) Parking lots and street ponding.
(4) Seepage pits, seepage trenches or other infiltration structures.
(5) Porous pavement and concrete lattice block surfaces.
(6) Grassed channels and vegetated strips.
(7) Cisterns and underground reservoirs.
(8) Routed flow over grass.
(9) Decreased impervious area coverage.

§ 164-32. Dedication of land.
In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of
the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with
Rostraver Township for the granting of an easement or the dedication
of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site
stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by
the applicant and Rostraver Township prior to the recording of plats, or, if
no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the building permit.
D. Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for
stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the
minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures
selected by Rostraver Township. Mitigation measures may include, but
are not limited to, the following:
(1) The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation.
These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in
order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality
and aquatic habitat.
(2) The creation of a stormwater management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public
or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities
designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and
standards of this chapter.

article are fully complied with. If any such emergency condition shall not
be immediately attended to by the owner or person responsible for that
pipe, line, construction or apparatus, the Township Engineer or his agent,
after such notice as he shall deem necessary under the circumstances of
the particular case, shall proceed to do the work necessary and required by
the emergency and charge the same on the basis of costs plus 20% to such
owner or person.

I. In case it is necessary to cross under any improved road or highway, the
opening for pipe line shall be drilled, bored or driven at a minimum
depth of three feet below the surface of the road or highway or the
structure may be placed by tunneling when approved by the permitter.
Trenching will be authorized by the permitter, in writing, where
tunneling would be attended with danger to life. Where necessary to
cross the improved road or highway by tunneling, the crossing shall be
made, except in solid rock formation, under 1/2 of the improved road
width, and the pipe or structure placed and the hole carefully backfilled
with 1 to 3 to 6 concrete of a dry consistency thoroughly tamped, and
allowed to stand 24 hours before traffic is permitted to use that half of
the road. The second half of the tunneling is to be completed in the
same manner, so at least one-way traffic will be maintained over 1/2 the
improved road or highway while the second half is being tunneled. In
solid rock formation, the crossing may be made by trenching when
approved by the engineer representing the permitter, but not more than

end of the actual operation, and special employees shall be assigned by
the permittee to direct traffic when it becomes necessary to limit it to
one way. Advance permission must be obtained from permitter or
authorized agents before directing traffic through one lane. Substantial
barricades shall be provided and maintained between the road and any
open trench or hole when, in the judgment of the representative of the
permitter, it is necessary for the proper protection of the traveling
public.

A. All poles shall be placed on the outside of the gutter lines, and in all
cases a clear space greater than the width of the berm or shoulder must
be preserved between the near face of the poles and the edge of the
improved or traveled road or highway, unless the permitter shall
otherwise authorize in writing. No poles or other overhead structures
shall be placed where they will obstruct the view of traffic on the
highway, nor within five feet of any warning or direction sign, unless

highways after being erected shall be painted white by the permittee at
its own expense for a height of at least six feet above the ground, when
so required by the permitter.
B. All wires, except power transmission and supply lines, appurtenances
or supports attached to poles which cross the highway shall be placed
or erected so as to provide a minimum vertical clearance of 16 1/2 feet
for a distance of 14 feet on both sides of the highway center line. Where

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 175-1. Authority.
The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania empower local governments
to regulate the subdivision of land. The authority for this function has
been established by the General Assembly under the provisions of Act 247,
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended by Act 170 of
1988.58
§ 175-2. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance of the Township of Rostraver, Westmoreland
County, Pennsylvania."
§ 175-3. Purposes.
This chapter has been developed to require basic minimum standards for
the development of land, including the subdivision thereof, into separate
lots; and establishes rules and regulations, definitions, application
procedures and permits by which the standards may be carried out. These
requirements are designed to provide for:
A. The coordinated development of land throughout the Township;
B. Assurance that new subdivisions will be developed consistent with the
maintenance of the health, safety and general welfare of the public;
C. Necessary public facilities in an amount and size commensurate with
the needs of the area to be subdivided and the uses to which the land
will be devoted;
D. Assistance in identification of hazards from flooding, landslides,
subsidence or other dangers, by requirements that land subject to such
dangers will be made safe for its proposed use or be set aside for uses
that will not precipitate dangerous conditions;
E. Protection of the soil, water and other natural environmental resources
of the area from the effects of uncontrolled development practices;
F. Coordination of continuing community growth with respect to overall
development considerations, such as sewage disposal, water supply,
drainage facilities, traffic circulation systems, emergency accessways,
retention of open spaces and related factories; and
G. Equitable administration of all subdivision and development proposals
throughout the municipality.

constructed, opened or dedicated for public use or travel, or for the common
use of occupants of buildings abutting thereon, except in strict conformance
with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 175-5. Sale of lot.
A. No lot in a subdivision shall be sold; no permit to erect any building
upon land in a subdivision shall be issued; and no building shall be
erected in a subdivision, unless and until a subdivision plan has been
approved and recorded and until the improvements required by the
governing body in connection therewith have either been constructed
or guaranteed as hereinafter provided.
B. The division of a lot containing more than one principal structure for
the purpose of transferring legal ownership of a structure and the land
on which it is situated, that involves no new land development or new
streets or the realignment of existing streets, may be considered a
minor subdivision by the governing body. In such instances, provided
that all applicable ordinances and criteria established by the
municipality are met, the governing body may waive such procedures

requirements that have not been met and shall, in each case, cite
the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.
(3) Failure of the governing body to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner

the applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time or
change in the prescribed manner of presentation of communication
of the decision, in which case, failure to meet the extended time or
change in manner of preservation of communication shall have like
effect.

or amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plan shall affect the decision on such application
adversely to the applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to
a decision in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinance or plans as they stood at the time the application
was duly filed. However, if an application is properly and finally
denied, any subsequent application shall be subject to the
intervening change in government regulations.
(b) When an application for approval of a preliminary or final plan
has been approved or approved subject to conditions
acceptable to the applicant, no subsequent change or

five-year period shall be counted from the date of the
preliminary approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms
of a preliminary approval, the terms shall be constructed in the
light of provisions of the governing ordinance or plans as they
stood at the time when the application for such approval was
duly filed.

improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be
filed by the landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all
proposed sections as well as deadlines within which
applications for final plat approval of each section are intended
to be filed. Such schedule shall be updated annually by the

development, except for the last section, shall contain a
minimum of 25% of the total number of dwelling units as

compliance with landowner's aforesaid schedule of submission
of final plats for the various sections, then the aforesaid
protections afforded by substantially completing the
improvements depicted upon the final plat within five years
shall apply, and for any section or sections, beyond the initial
section, in which the required improvements have not been
substantially completed within said five-year period, the
aforesaid protections shall apply for an additional term or
terms of three years from the date of final plat approval for
each section.
(g) Failure of landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plats for the various sections shall subject

C. Internal subdivision streets shall be laid out to discourage unnecessary
through traffic, but provisions to coordinate adjacent area streets will
be generally required.
D. Where a subdivision plan abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the governing body may require local access streets,
reverse frontage lots or such other treatment that will provide
protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of
intersections with arterial streets and separation of local and through
traffic.
E. New half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where essential
to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other
requirements and standards of this chapter and where, in addition,
satisfactory assurances for dedication of the remaining part of the
street is secured.
F. Wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or partial
street, the other part of the street shall be plotted within such tract.
G. Cul-de-sac streets may be permitted when it is clear that through traffic
at such a street end is not essential to the existing or future street

system in that district or to the development of adjacent properties in
the area.
(1) Such streets, where permitted, shall not exceed 500 feet, including
the turnaround at the closed end. A request for a waiver can be
made to the Board of Commissioners, with a narrative explaining
how additional length improves the subdivision design, results in a
better relationship of the proposed development to the existing
topography and does not create any hardships for the subdivision's
residents or the Township's. [Amended 8-7-2002 by Ord. No.
467]
(2) The turnaround shall have an outside pavement radius of not less
than 40 feet and a right-of-way radius of not less than 50 feet.
(3) The minimum grade of the turnaround portion of the cul-de-sac
shall be 1%.

shall be 5%.
(5) All culs-de-sac must have a minimum of two drainage structures or
as required by the Township Engineer.
H. If lots resulting from original subdivision are large enough to permit
additional subdivision or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided,
adequate street rights-of-way shall be provided as necessary to allow
for future development activity.
I. Reserve strips, restricting or controlling access to adjacent streets or
properties, shall be prohibited.
J. The maximum allowable center-line grades are shown in Table 1.72
Short sections of roadway in excess of those shown in Table 1 may be
approved by the governing body where it is clear that no traffic hazards
or maintenance problem will be created.
K. Minimum grades on all streets shall not be less than 1%.
L. Vertical alignment. Vertical curves shall be installed on all street grade
changes to provide for minimum sight distances of 150 feet.
M. Horizontal alignment. Minimum center-line radii for horizontal curves
shall be 150 feet.
N. Widths. Minimum cartway paving and right-of-way widths are shown in
Table 1.73
(1) Except additional right-of-way and cartway width may be required
by the governing body for the following purposes:

1:282
(a) To promote public safety and convenience where anticipated
traffic flows warrant or where drainage easements should
reasonably parallel thoroughfares.
(b) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of
inadequate right-of-way.
(2) Where a subdivision abuts a state right-of-way less than the
standards in Table 174 for a particular roadway classification, the
building setback shall be increased by an amount equal to 1/2 the
difference between the existing right-of-way width and the
standard right-of-way width in Table 1.
O. Street intersections.
(1) All curbs at intersections shall be rounded by a minimum radius
shown in Table 1.75
(2) Grades approaching intersections shall not exceed 3% for a
distance of not less than 25 feet from the nearest right-of-way line
of the intersection.
(3) Multiple intersection of more than four streets shall be prohibited.
(4) Minimum street intersection angles shall be 90° unless approved
by the Board of Commissioners. [Amended 8-7-2002 by Ord. No.
467]
(5) A clear sight triangle shall be maintained at all intersections within
an area formed by the intersecting street lines and a line joining
points on the street lines 75 feet from the corner.
(6) Intersections of local streets with collector and arterial streets
shall be kept to a minimum, consistent with topography and other
local conditions. Intersections of less than 150 feet shall be
avoided.
P. Alleys shall not be permitted in any subdivision.
Q. Private streets (vehicular rights-of-way not dedicated for public use)
shall not be approved nor shall layout or improvements for lots abutting
private streets be approved.
R. Streets proposed for commercial or industrial land development
purposes shall, if possible, be laid out to intersect directly with arterial

(c) The grading of any earth by cut or fill shall not exceed a slope
of 3:1.
[1] Should a slope in excess of 3:1 and greater than six feet in
height be necessary, the property owner shall prepare and
file a soils report with all boring logs prepared by a
registered professional engineer certifying to the slope's
stability or, in the alternative, a retaining structure with a
minimum of a four-foot chain link fence shall be designed
and certified by a registered professional engineer in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
§ 175-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 175-19

[2] Any cut or fill greater than six feet in height and in excess
of a 3:1 slope shall have a minimum four-foot chain link
fence erected from at the top of the slope through its
entire length.
(7) The literal application of front yard setback requirements for
single-family dwellings, as set forth in the Township Zoning
Ordinance,79 may be relaxed by the governing body in
predominantly developed areas, provided that:
(a) Seventy-five percent or more of the established structures on
the same side of the street in the immediate vicinity have front
yard areas less than required by the Zoning Ordinance.
(b) For purposes of this setback relaxation, immediate vicinity
shall be interpreted as a block area not exceeding 800 linear
feet which is between either two intersecting streets or an
intersecting street and a cul-de-sac.
(c) In the absence of typical block development in open or rural
areas, the immediate vicinity shall be determined as developed
parcels within 500 linear feet of the subject property.
(d) Where setback relaxations are granted, the front yard setback
requirements shall be established as the average setback of all
existing structures in the immediate vicinity.
(e) The relaxation of setback requirements under this section shall
require a variance from the Zoning Hearing Board and shall be
employed only to achieve orderly development and not to
circumvent the purpose and intent of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance or of the Zoning Ordinance.
B. Lots laid out for residential purposes shall be subdivided in accordance
with the provisions of the Township Zoning Ordinance with respect to
lot area, lot width, setbacks, yard requirements and other applicable
requisites and requirements.
C. Nonresidential purposes.
(1) Lots and tracts of land laid out for nonresidential purposes shall be
subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the Township
Zoning Ordinance80 with respect to lot area, lot width, setbacks,

§ 175-19.1. Traffic impact studies. [Added 7-2-2008 by Ord. No.
574]
land use proposals shall be included as a part of all final plan
applications for nonresidential purposes.
(3) The Planning Agency may recommend and the Board of
Commissioners may authorize block platting in place of lot platting
for nonresidential purposes to provide the developer maximum
flexibility, provided that no block shall be subdivided in such a way
that any subsequent lots would be smaller than the minimum size
authorized by this chapter for residential uses. [Amended
8-7-2002 by Ord. No. 467]
(4) The developer shall demonstrate every effort to protect adjacent
existing or potential residential development sites through the
provision of guaranties or other appropriate procedures or
amenities designed and established for the purpose of mitigating
adverse influences resulting from business activities.
A. Purpose:
(1) To allow the Township to determine the safety and congestion
impacts, and related costs, of proposed major traffic-generating
uses.
(2) To require that applicants respond with reasonable proposals to
resolve the negative traffic impacts that their proposed uses will
cause on the public.
(3) To recognize that sufficient federal, state, and Township funds are
not available to resolve traffic problems caused by private
development.
(4) To assist in carrying out Sections 503(2)(ii) and 503(3) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.81
(5) To ensure that streets bordering a subdivision or land development
are coordinated and of such widths and grades and in such
locations as deemed necessary to accommodate prospective traffic
and to facilitate fire protection.
(6) To ensure that the access into and out of subdivisions and land
developments is reasonably safe.
B. Administration.
(1) The Rostraver Township Planning Agency may require a full or
abbreviated traffic study as a part of its review process for
subdivisions and land developments consistent with the standards
of this section.
81.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10503(2)(ii) and (3).
§ 175-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 175-19.1
1:287
(2) The full cost of the traffic study shall be borne by the applicant. Any
costs associated with professional review of the traffic study by the
Township's professional consultants shall also be borne by the
applicant. The applicant shall provide the appropriate escrow to
ensure the payment of the costs of such traffic study review.
(3) Traffic impact studies shall be prepared by a qualified traffic
engineer and/or transportation planner with previous traffic study
experience. To be considered as qualified, the engineer or planner
shall have completed at least three comparable studies and shall
make copies of same available to the Township. The Township
reserves the right to review and approve the qualifications of any
proposed consultant.
(4) The Township shall require such on-site traffic improvements to be
provided by the applicant, as the Township deems appropriate, in
light of the traffic impact study as a specific condition of
preliminary plan approval for all land developments and/or
subdivisions for which a study has been required. The study shall
identify improvements/facilities to be installed or actions to be
undertaken by the applicant.
(5) Joint traffic studies between different applicants are acceptable
and are strongly encouraged.
(6) The Township will ensure that its own selected consulting traffic
engineer or other professional consultants for any project do not
have a current professional relationship with the applicant of the
land development or subdivision plan or a current professional
relationship with the traffic engineer that prepared the traffic study
for the applicant. The Township reserves the right to review the
qualifications of any proposed consultant.
C. Determination of the level of traffic study required. The Planning
Agency shall make a determination on the level of traffic study
required, based upon two factors: the location of the proposed
development, and the projected traffic generation of the proposed
development.
(1) Location factors. The Township has identified the following as
stressed roads and intersections in its Comprehensive Plan:
(a) Stressed roads:
[1] PA Route 51.
[2] PA Route 201.
[3] Finley Road.
(b) Stressed intersections:
[1] Route 51 and Airport Road.
§ 175-19.1 ROSTRAVER CODE § 175-19.1
1:288
[2] Route 51 and Webster Hollow Road/Salem Church
Crossover.
[3] Route 51 and Fells Church Road/Fells Church Crossover.
[4] Route 51 and Vernon Drive.
[5] Route 51 and McKenery Drive/Snyder Lane.
[6] Route 51 and Port Royal Road.
[7] Finely Road and SR 201.
[8] SR 201 and SR 3031 (Vance DeiCas Highway).
(2) As deemed necessary by changes in information gathering and new
land developments, the Township may remove or add new stressed
roads and intersections as necessary by a resolution of the majority
of Commissioners.
(3) Determination of peak hour trips. As a general guide, the Planning
Agency shall utilize Table 3.2 and the second edition of
Transportation and Land Development, as published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), and adapted below for
reference. However, the Planning Agency may utilize alternative
information provided by the developer for more specific land uses,
if consistent with the ITE trip generation manual.

(5) The Township Board of Commissioners may still, at its discretion,
require any other subdivision or land development application to be
accompanied by a traffic impact study. In such circumstances, the
Commissioners will notify the applicant within 60 days following
the Planning Agency's first meeting with the applicant. Such a
notification shall specify the reason for the requirement, citing the
proposal's particular location or existing problems or type of use
(i.e., generation of heavy truck traffic).
D. Abbreviated study requirements.
(1) The following abbreviated traffic impact study shall be required as
part of the preliminary plan submission. Development of a project
in stages, or on a piecemeal basis, will not avoid this requirement.
The trips expected to be produced by the ultimate build out of the
development will be the basis for such a study. However, even if a
development generates less than the required peak hour trips, it is
not totally excluded from the adequacy requirements of these
guidelines, unless site traffic generation is anticipated to be de
minimus (less than five peak hour trips).
(2) A written, abbreviated traffic study, where appropriate, and a
traffic calming and access management analysis shall be submitted
at the time of the preliminary plan application and shall include:
(a) Projected peak a.m., p.m., and/or Saturday traffic volumes of
the development.
(b) Projected ADT (average daily trips) of the development.
(c) Current ADT and peak hour volumes of streets adjacent to any
access drives.
(d) LOS (level of service) of existing and proposed access drives.
(e) Modal split of services (categories of vehicles) entering the
site.
(f) Proposed sight distances at access drives.
(g) Existing and proposed pedestrian paths from streets and
within the site to entrances of all buildings.
§ 175-19.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 175-19.1
1:291
(h) The study shall identify improvements/facilities to be installed
or actions to be undertaken by the applicant to ensure the
following:
[1] LOS C or higher overall for all new access drives.
[2] No reduction in the levels of service for existing access
drives, except that LOS D shall be permitted during the
a.m. and p.m. peak hours. If an applicant cannot meet this
requirement, an analysis shall be completed to show that
all reasonable options have been considered to create the
most efficient access possible.
[3] Sight distances for all access drives intersecting with all
streets shall meet Township and/or PennDOT
requirements, as applicable.
E. Full traffic impact study requirements.
(1) A written, full traffic study, and, where appropriate, traffic calming
and access management measures shall be submitted at the time of
preliminary plan application. The study area shall include all public
streets and intersections within a radius of 1,600 feet of an access
drive to the site, unless the Township's consulting traffic engineer
determines that another study area shall be more appropriate. The
full traffic study shall include, at a minimum, the following:
(a) Current ADT and peak hour volumes of all streets.
(b) Current LOS of all intersections.
(c) Projected ADT and peak hour volumes of all streets without the
development.
(d) Projected LOS of all intersections without the development.
(e) Site traffic generation, including projected ADT and peak hour
volumes of the development. Development of a project in
stages, or on a piecemeal basis, must create a realistic
assumption expected to be produced by the ultimate build out
of the development.
(f) Site traffic distribution.
(g) Site traffic assignment.
(h) Projected ADT and peak hour volumes of all streets and
intersections within the development.
(i) Projected LOS of all intersections within the development,
including all existing and proposed access drives.
(j) An assessment of the change in roadway operating conditions
resulting from the development traffic.
§ 175-19.1 ROSTRAVER CODE § 175-19.1
1:292
§ 175-20. Blocks.
(k) Modal split of vehicles entering the site.
(l) Proposed sight distances at access drives.
(m) Existing and proposed pedestrian paths from streets and
within the site to entrances of all buildings.
(2) The study shall identify improvements/facilities to be installed or
actions to be undertaken by the applicant to ensure the following:
(a) LOC C or higher overall for all new access driveways.
(b) No reduction in the levels of service for existing access
driveways, except that LOS D shall be permitted during the
a.m. and p.m. peak hours. If an applicant cannot meet this
requirement, an analysis shall be completed to show that all
reasonable options have been considered to create the most
efficient access possible.
(c) No reduction in the levels of service of intersections within the
study area as a result of the development; however, if the
intersection already has an LOS, no reduction in the
intersection delay shall occur.
(d) Sight distances for all access drives intersecting with all rightsof-
way shall meet Township and/or PennDOT requirements, as
applicable.
F. Implementation. The Commissioners shall review the traffic impact
study to analyze its adequacy in solving any traffic problems that will
occur due to the land development or subdivision. The Township's
traffic engineer shall review the study and submit their review
comments to the Commissioners. These review comments shall be part
of the Township's official review and approval process. The
Commissioners may decide that certain improvements contained on
and/or adjacent to the site and within the study area are necessary for
land development or subdivision plan approval and may attach these
conditions to the approval. If the municipality concludes that additional
improvements are necessary, the developer shall have the opportunity
to resubmit alternative improvement designs to obtain plan approval.
A. Block length shall not ordinarily exceed 1,800 feet nor be less than 500
feet depending on topography, adjacent road configurations and other
related criteria.
B. Blocks shall be at least two lots in depth except for reverse frontage
lots.
C. The depth to width ratio of usable lot length shall be a maximum of 2 1/
2 to 1.

§ 175-21. Easements.
§ 175-22. Sidewalks. [Amended 7-5-2006 by Ord. No. 550]
A. Utility and public utility easements shall have a minimum width of 20
feet and be placed at the side or rear of lots and underground whenever
possible. When the governing body determines that conditions are
suitable for utilities and/or public utilities, an easement reservation will
be required.
B. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, there shall be
provided a drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially
with the line of such watercourse and of such width as will be adequate
to preserve natural drainage and provide sufficient width for
maintenance purposes, but not less than 20 feet. Where available,
federal, state and local flood maps and data shall be employed to
determine the location of easements or rights-of-way required by this
chapter.
A. Sidewalks shall be required to be constructed in all subdivisions and
land developments involving the construction of new public streets,
unless otherwise waived by the Board of Commissioners under the
provisions of § 175-22C of this chapter.
B. Unless an alternative installation plan is proposed by the developer, and
approved by the Board of Commissioners as part of the development
agreement, sidewalks within residential subdivisions and land
developments shall be installed at the time of initial roadway
construction. The developer shall be responsible for bonding all
sidewalks pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.82
C. When one of the following conditions exists making the installation of
sidewalks unnecessary or impractical, the developer shall so
demonstrate those condition(s) and request, in writing, to the Board of
Commissioners that this requirement be waived in whole or in part.
Approval or denial of the request shall be made, in writing, by the Board
of Commissioners. Financial consideration of the costs of construction
of the proposed sidewalks shall not be considered by the Board as a
reason for waiving this requirement.
(1) Ninety percent of the lots within all phases of the plan are greater
than one acre.
(2) The subdivision plan has only one street which is a cul-de-sac.
(3) The subdivision plan is less than 10 acres, including all phases of
the plan.

Reserve strips surrounding property or areas reserved for any purpose
that shall make any area unprofitable for regular or special assessments or
that may revert to an untended nuisance area will not be approved by the
governing body.
§ 175-24. Street names and numbering. [Amended 12-6-2006 by
Ord. No. 556]
A. The following provisions shall apply to the assigning of all street
name(s) public/private:
(1) At the time of filing an application for a preliminary subdivision and
or land development, the property owner shall submit to the
Township a written request of at least five proposed new street
names for each new street being proposed. The proposed names
will be reviewed with the Westmoreland County Department of
Public Safety and approved to avoid possible duplication.
(2) Street name(s) become final upon recording of the final subdivision
plan and/or approval of a final land development plan.
(3) Street name(s) may be reserved for three years. If final recording of
the preliminary subdivision does not occur and/or construction
does not begin on a land development within three years, a written
request for a two-year extension of the street name(s) reservation
shall be submitted to the Township and the Westmoreland County
Department of Public Safety. If such a request is not received, the
name(s) will no longer be reserved.
B. It shall be the responsibility of the landowner of each dwelling,
apartment building, mobile home, business, industry and/or all other
principal buildings to purchase, post and maintain proper identification
of such structures within 60 days of the enactment of this section and of
all future owners of such structures to post proper identification prior
to occupancy.
C. Proper identification shall consist of the address number posted in

§ 175-26. Recreation dedication; fee in lieu of land. [Amended
7-3-2002 by Ord. No. 461; 7-5-2006 by Ord. No. 550; 7-2-2008 by
Ord. No. 573]
In order to implement Section 503(11) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code,83 Rostraver Township has adopted an Official Recreation
Plan. This section applies to new residential subdivisions or new residential
land developments (including planned residential developments or new
mobile home parks or new mobile home lots). All residential subdivisions
and residential land developments of at least 20 lots or at least 20 dwelling
units shall provide the reservation of suitable grounds for recreation, or pay
a fee in lieu of such land, or construct public recreation facilities, or present
a combination of dedicated land, facilities construction and fees. All such
requirements shall conform to the authority conferred in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code (53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.), and constitute a
condition precedent to preliminary or final plan approval. The applicant and
developer shall hereinafter collectively be referred to as either "applicant"
or "developer." In the case of a multiphase plan, wherein less than 20 lots
are created, this section shall apply to all lots created from the parent
tract or dwelling units erected upon the tract for a period of five years
from the date of initial application. The Commissioners may also require the
dedication of land or fees in lieu for subdivisions of less than 20 lots, where
it is obvious that additional lands remain available for subdivision from the
parent tract.
A. An applicant for preliminary plat approval on an applicable multiphase
plan or single phase final plan approval of a residential land
development or subdivision shall dedicate to the Township for public
use a portion of such site as a recreation area. The total amount of land
to be deeded to the Township shall be equivalent to at least 3,400
square feet per dwelling unit. The Township may enter into an
agreement with the developer to satisfy the recreational use and open
space/green area public dedication requirements prescribed in this
section upon payment to the Township of the sum of not less than $700
for each dwelling unit in a residential land development plan or each lot
in a residential subdivision or mobile home park. The above fee may be
adjusted from time to time for inflation, and the current applicable fee
shall be indicated in the Township schedule of fees, adopted by
resolution. Alternative land, fee, facility or construction combinations
shall be an agreed amount based upon the value of any land, fees, items
purchased and services provided. The Township Planning Agency and
Rostraver Township Recreation Commission shall review such
alternatives for consistency with the Official Recreation Plan, prior to
acceptance by the Board of Commissioners.
B. Criteria for site selection of land for recreational use.
(1) The land proposed shall be accessible to the residents of the
development and citizens of the Township. At least one side of the
83.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10503(11).
§ 175-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 175-26
1:297
proposed site shall abut a public street, for a minimum distance of
50 feet, unless an easement at least 50 feet in width and dedicated
for access to the recreational land is provided. However, no public
roadways shall transverse the site.
(2) At least 75% of land for parks, playgrounds and sports fields shall
be free of slopes greater than 5%, as determined by mapping
prepared for the Township Comprehensive Plan.
(3) At least 75% of the site shall be free from wetland restrictions or
floodplain.
(4) The soil conditions shall be suitable for recreation use, as
determined by reference to the Westmoreland County Soil Survey.
(5) For phased plans, all land to be set aside shall be situated in the
first phase, unless otherwise approved by the Township Board of
Commissioners. Delivery of deed describing land proposed for
dedication to the Township shall be completed prior to plan
recording.
(6) The site shall be easily accessible to all essential utilities, including
water, sewage, and power.
(7) The site and any proposed improvements shall be consistent with
the recommendations of the Rostraver Township Official
Recreation Plan and the Rostraver Township Comprehensive Plan.
C. Fee in lieu of required recreational land.
(1) If land offered to meet the criteria of sites for parks, playgrounds or
other recreational use is not consistent with the recommendations
of the Recreation Commission and the Planning Agency, or if the
Comprehensive Plan or Official Recreation Plan for the Township of
Rostraver indicates that such land offered cannot be properly
located in the proposed development or subdivision because the
future inhabitants of the development and surrounding area are to
be served by recreational land/facilities established or to be
established by the Township in the subject locality, or if the
conditions to render the site suitable for the use intended cannot be
agreed upon, then, upon agreement with the applicant or
developer, the payment of fees in lieu of the land offered or a
combination of fees and land shall be required as a condition
precedent to preliminary or final plan approval. The applicant or
developer may also pay the fee in lieu of land at his discretion.
(2) The fee in lieu of required land shall be paid to the Township prior
to release of the plan for recording or as specified in a schedule of
payment agreed upon by the Township Commissioners.
(3) All fee payments received pursuant to this section shall be used
solely and exclusively for the acquisition of land for parks,

1:298
§ 175-27. Parking lots. [Added 6-2-1999 by Ord. No. 409; amended
8-7-2002 by Ord. No. 467; 6-2-2010 by Ord. No. 602]
All parking lots shall be landscaped in accordance with Chapter 195.84
playgrounds or other recreational sites and the construction of
improvements thereon, and for costs incidental and ancillary to
such purposes, including but not necessarily limited to site
planning, engineering and design of recreational space and
improvements, utility relocation, grading and site preparation,
provision of pedestrian and/or vehicular access and purchase of
park equipment. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Township and
the developer, payments received pursuant to this section shall be
used only for land or improvements specifically included in the
Official Recreation Plan for the Township of Rostraver, as amended,
and as supplemented by the list of needed park improvements
developed by the Recreation Commission. Such park and
recreational facilities shall be accessible to the subject
development or subdivision.
D. Where the development or construction of recreation facilities is
offered as a part of the land or fees-in-lieu options, recreation facilities
shall be bonded and have improvement guarantees posted or deposited
as with any other subdivision improvements, such as streets, sidewalks,
curbs, and drainage facilities.
E. All fees in lieu paid to the Township shall be placed in a capital reserve
fund established as provided by law, which shall clearly identify the
facility or area for which the fee was collected. Interest earned on the
capital reserve fund shall become part of the capital reserve fund. Fees
collected shall be expended only for the purpose of providing park or
recreational facilities accessible to the residents of the development.
F. If the Township has failed to utilize the fee paid for the purposes set
forth in this section within three years from the date such fee was paid,
any person who paid such a fee may request a refund. The Township
shall refund said fee plus interest accumulated thereon from the date of
payment.

accepted by the governing body.
B. Guaranty of future performance. In lieu of requiring the completion of
all improvements prior to final plan approval, the Township may, at its
discretion, require that the development agreement described in
§ 175-12F of this chapter contain provisions whereby the subdivider
shall guarantee to complete all improvements required by this chapter
or otherwise specified by the governing body, in a manner satisfactory
to the governing body. When requested by the subdivider in order to
facilitate financing, the governing body shall furnish the subdivider

surety bonding company authorized to do business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The bond shall be payable to the
Township. The amount of the bond shall be equal to 110% of the
cost of the required improvements as estimated by the subdivider
and approved by the Township Engineer. The duration of the bond
shall be until such time as the improvements are accepted by the
Township in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
(2) Escrow account. The subdivider shall deposit cash or other
instrument readily convertible into cash at face value, either with
the Township or in escrow with a bank. The use of any instrument
other than cash and, in the case of an escrow account, the bank
with which the funds are to be deposited shall be subject to the
approval of the governing body. The amount of financial security
shall be equal to 110% of the cost of the required improvements as
estimated by the subdivider and approved by the Township
Engineer. In case of an escrow account, the subdivider shall file
with the governing body an agreement between the financial bank
and himself guaranteeing the following:
(a) That the funds of said escrow account shall be held in trust
until released by the governing body and may not be used or
pledged by the subdivider as security in any other matter
during the period; and
(b) That in the case of a failure on the part of the subdivider to
complete said improvements in a timely manner, the bank shall
immediately make the funds in said account available by the
Township for use in the completion of those improvements.

any such road or drainage facility, notwithstanding any use of the same by
the public; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent
the laying of trunk sewers, drains, water or gas mains, if required, by

§ 175-44. Standards for location and management of open space.
A. Common open spaces, when provided, shall be located so as to be
consistent with accepted design principles. Where possible, it shall be
designed as a contiguous area easily accessible to the residents and
preserving natural features.
B. There shall be provisions that ensure that the common open space shall
continue as such and be properly maintained.
(1) The developer shall either:
(a) Dedicate such land to public use if the Township or another
public agency has indicated it will accept such dedications;
(b) Retain ownership and responsibility for maintenance of such
open space; or
(c) Provide for and establish one or more organizations for the
ownership and maintenance of all common open space.
(2) In the case of Subsection B(1)(b) and (c) above, each organization
shall be a nonprofit homeowners' corporation, unless the developer
demonstrates that a community open space trust is a more
appropriate form of organization.
C. If a homeowners' association or open space trust is formed, it shall be
governed according to the following regulations:
(1) The organization is organized by the developer and operated with
financial subsidization by the developer (if necessary) before the
sale of any lots within the development.
(2) Membership in the organization is mandatory for all purchasers of
homes therein and their successors.
(3) The organization shall be responsible for maintenance, insurance
and taxes on common open space.
(4) The members of the organization shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining and developing common open space, in accordance
with procedures established by them.
(5) The organization shall have to hire adequate staff to administer
facilities and maintain the common open space.
§ 175-43 ROSTRAVER CODE § 175-44
1:310
(a) In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain common open space or any successor organization
shall at any time after establishment of the development fail to
maintain the common open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the development plan, the
Township may serve written notice upon such organization or
upon the residents of the development setting forth the
manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the
common open space in reasonable condition.
(b) Said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of
maintenance be corrected within 30 days thereof and shall
state the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be
held within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing, the
Township may modify the terms of the original notice as to the
deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which
they shall be corrected.
(c) If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modifications thereof shall not be corrected within said 30 days
or any extension thereof, the Township may enter upon said
common space and maintain the same for a period of one year.
(d) Said maintenance by the Township shall not constitute a
taking, nor vest in the public any rights of use.
(e) Before the expiration of said year, the Township shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore
responsible for maintenance, call a public hearing, upon notice
to such organization or to the residents of the development. At
the hearing, such organization or the residents of the
development shall show cause why such maintenance by the
Township shall not, at the option of the Township, continue for
a succeeding year.
(f) If the governing body determines that such organization is
ready and able to maintain said common space in reasonable
condition, the Township shall cease maintenance at the end of
said year.
(g) If the governing body shall determine that such organization is
not ready and able to maintain said common open space in a
reasonable condition, the Township may, at its discretion,
continue maintenance during the next succeeding year and,
subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each year
thereafter.
(h) The cost of maintenance by the Township shall be assessed
against the properties within the development that have a right
of enjoyment of the common open space and shall become a
lien on said properties. The Township, at the time of entering
upon said common open space for the purpose of maintenance,
§ 175-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 175-44
1:311
shall file a notice of such lien in the office of the Prothonotary
of the county, upon the properties affected by such lien within
the development.

who has commenced his business at least one full year prior to the
beginning of any tax year shall compute his annual gross receipts upon
the actual receipts received by him during the preceding calendar year.
B. Every person subject to the payment of the tax imposed by this article
who has commenced or who commences his business less than one full
year prior to the beginning of any tax year shall compute his annual
gross receipts for such tax year upon the gross receipts generated by

payment of his tax becomes due for such tax year, he shall be permitted
to apportion his tax for such tax year and shall pay an amount to be
computed by multiplying his gross receipts for the preceding full
calendar year by a fraction whose numerator shall be the number of
months such person was in business during the tax year and whose
denominator shall be 12.

vendor for previous quarterly periods, rental paid by the vendor, stock
on hand and other factors; provided, however, that if any vendor shall
submit to such Assessor his financial records of the previous year, such

the alleged violation shall involve a firm, association, copartnership or
corporation, each and every copartner or official thereof shall be liable,
together with the vendor or party making the return or liable for payment
of the tax, and may be prosecuted hereunder.
§ 182-54. Exceptions.
This article shall not apply to any person or property as to whom or which it
is beyond the legal power of the Board of Commissioners to impose the tax
or duties provided for in this article.

assessment, insofar as possible, shall be based upon such records
rather than upon external indices.
B. To any tax based upon any assessment made by such special Assessor
shall be added the penalty due for nonpayment of the tax when due and
the amount of tax due to the special Assessor to compensate him for his
work of assessing the amount of tax due from such vendor. After such
assessment, the special Tax Assessor shall give written notice of such
assessment to the vendor concerned. Such assessment shall finally and
irrevocably fix and determine the tax due unless the vendor shall

result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability

B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
§ 182-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 182-60
1:367
§ 182-61. Duty of employers to collect.
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of 12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Township of Rostraver, in consultation with the Collector
and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general
municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on
overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75
days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject
to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Township of Rostraver or the
Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds
to exempt persons.
§ 182-60 ROSTRAVER CODE § 182-61
1:368
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 182-60B of
§ 182-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 182-61
1:369
§ 182-62. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 182-63. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
Each employer shall use his employment and payroll records from the
first day of January to March 31 each year for determining the number
of employees from whom said tax shall be deducted and paid over to the
collector on or before April 30 of the same calendar year. Supplemental
reports shall be made by each employer on July 30, October 30 and January
31 for new employees as reflected on his employment and payroll records
from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30 and October 1 to December
31, and payments on these supplemental reports shall be made on July 30,
October 30 and January 31, respectively.
§ 182-64. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who has earned income or realizes net profit,
as those terms are defined herein, within the political subdivision shall be
required to comply with this article and pay the tax due to the Collector on
or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 182-65. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
§ 182-61 ROSTRAVER CODE § 182-65
1:370
§ 182-66. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 182-67. Administration of tax.
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive payments of
this tax and keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him
from each employer or self-employed person, together with the date the
tax was received. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and keep
a record of the information submitted by employers relating to the
number of employees subject to the tax, the number of employees
exempt from the tax, the employee exemption certificates and refunds
of the tax paid to individuals and employers.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
to the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County as in other
cases provided.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.

§ 182-68. Suits for collection.
§ 182-68.1. Violations and penalties.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.
§ 182-68.2. Interpretation.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

ordinance provision governing those lots.
§ 187-27. Authority to remove and impound.
The police officers of the Township shall have authority to remove and
impound or to order the removal and impounding of any vehicle parked

in an amount satisfactory to the Board of Commissioners as sufficient to
indemnify owners of impounded vehicles against loss or damage to those
vehicles while in the custody of the garage keeper for the purpose of towing
or storage. No different schedule of charges, which shall be set from time to
time by resolution of the Board of Commissioners, shall be adopted without

If payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the
offender shall be entitled to a hearing before a District Justice. Payment

§ 195-4. Community development objectives.
This chapter has been developed to assist in furthering the long-range
community development objectives of Rostraver Township as originally
outlined in the Rostraver Township Comprehensive Plan of 1966 and
subsequent reviews and evaluations of the material documented therein.
Considerations have included land use changes from 1966 to 1989, regional

conditions, population factors and other pertinent local and areawide
studies and documentation. Specifically, the local community development
objectives relate to the following elements:

coordination of interrelationships between living and working areas of
the community to provide for functionally distinguishable but
complimentary districts, as delineated in the various components of the
Comprehensive Plan and subsequent studies.
B. Maintenance and improvement of the aesthetic quality of the
community.
C. Protection of the natural environmental quality and significant open
space features throughout the Township.
D. Preservation of viable agricultural pursuits and areas devoted to such
purposes.
E. Protection of the residential character of the community consistent with
the need for a variety of housing types and densities and the ability of
the community to expand in an orderly manner.
F. Preservation of property values and encouragement of the highest and
best use of developable land areas.
G. Maintenance and expansion of the municipal economic base.
§ 195-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-4

H. Development of accessways, utility systems, municipal services and
community facilities consistent with local needs.
I. Coordination and cooperation with area and regional development
programs and trends that are consistent with the type and quality of
growth necessary to achieve the community development objectives of
the Township.

12-2-2015 by Ord. No. 658]
The MU Mixed Use District is established to provide for a wide range

environment, by fostering innovative building and open space masses
resulting in an aesthetically attractive working environment. Such uses
shall be able to meet comparatively rigid specifications as to nuisance-free
performance and shall be clean, quiet and free of objectionable elements.
This district is intended to be applied in situations where, because of special
circumstances, the area is particularly suited and useful for economic
development purposes, and yet is in such close proximity to existing
residential and agricultural uses that additional controls are deemed
necessary in order to make these uses compatible with existing residential
and agricultural uses; and provide the flexibility to adapt to changes in
markets and technologies The intent of this district is also to fulfill the intent
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code by including provisions to
encourage innovation and to promote flexibility, economy and ingenuity in
development, including subdivisions and land developments. Standards are
also established to fulfill the intent of Section 605(1) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code233with regard to making transitional
provisions at or near the boundaries of districts. The MU Mixed Use District
standards are established to facilitate either the unified approval of a single
large area for a planned business park development (including commercial
and residential components), or the development of smaller individual
tracts with provisions for the transition between various uses.

with any neighboring public recreation area or land protected by a
conservation easement. A minimum of 10% of the total planned
business park area shall be devoted to such greens or common
passive recreational areas. This shall be in addition to any normal
required yard and setback areas or limitations upon coverage. The
purpose of this is to create a stronger sense of place, and facilitate
interaction among the employees, customers and residents of
mixed use areas. Examples of such green or quadrangle areas may
include town squares, assembly areas, and smaller landscaped or
mowed areas with amenities, such as benches, lighting, public art
and fountains. At least 75% of areas proposed for central greens or
quadrangle areas shall be free of wetland or slope areas of greater
than 5%. These areas may be privately owned, or owned and
managed by a tenant or owners' association, provided there is a
reasonable degree of access by residents, employees, and
customers.
(3) The developer shall submit a sketch plan that generally identifies
proposed areas for various permitted and conditional uses within
the district. This sketch plan need not include final dimensions and
final designs of any public or private improvements, but shall focus
upon the relationship of proposed uses to each other and the
surrounding neighborhood. If areas are specifically identified for
conditional uses, and meet all performance standards, their
subsequent development may proceed by right at a later date
without additional conditional use approval. However, no area
proposed for a conditional use may be changed to another class of
conditional use (such as commercial to residential) without
submission of another application for approval. Areas proposed for
conditional uses may be changed to permitted uses within the MU
Mixed Use District. Nothing in this section alters the right of the
Township to review and approve changes to any subdivision and
land development plan.

A. Statement of purpose.
(1) This section of the Rostraver Township Zoning Ordinance regulates
and restricts the height of structures and objects of natural growth,
the density of residential development and otherwise regulates the
use of property in the vicinity of the Rostraver Airport by creating
appropriate zones and establishing the boundaries thereof;
providing for changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such
zones; defining certain terms used herein; and referring to the
maps that are incorporated in and made a part of this chapter.
(2) Obstructions and high densities of residential use have the
potential for endangering the lives and property of users of the
Rostraver Airport and property or occupants of land in its vicinity;
obstructions may affect existing and future instrument approach
minimums of the airport; and obstructions may reduce the size of
areas available for the landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft
thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the Rostraver Airport
and the investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared that:
(a) The creation or establishment of obstructions have the
potential for being public nuisances and injuring the region
served by the Rostraver Airport;
(b) The development of and potential for concentrated areas of
housing in the immediate vicinity of the Rostraver Airport
poses potential threats to the safety of inhabitants.
(c) It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety
and general welfare that the creation or establishment of
obstructions and population concentrations that are a hazard
to air navigation or human life be prevented; and
(d) The prevention of these obstructions and population
concentrations should be accomplished to the extent legally
possible, by the exercise of the police power, without
compensation.
B. Special definitions. The following definitions shall apply in
interpretation and application of airport safety control provisions:
AIRPORT  Rostraver Airport
AIRPORT ELEVATION  1,230 feet above mean sea level.
§ 195-78 ROSTRAVER CODE § 195-79
1:686
APPROACH SURFACE  A surface longitudinally centered on the
extended runway center line, extending outward and upward from the
end of the primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone
height limitation slope set forth in § 195-79C. In plan the perimeter
of the approach surface coincides with the perimeter of the approach
zone.
APPROACH, TRANSITIONAL, HORIZONTAL AND CONICAL ZONES 
These zones are set forth in § 195-79C.
CONICAL SURFACE  A surface extending outward and upward from
the periphery of the horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
HAZARD TO AIR NAVIGATION  An obstruction determined to have
a substantial adverse effect on the safe and efficient utilization of the
navigable airspace.
HEIGHT  For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones
set forth in this section and shown on the maps incorporated herein, the
datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
HORIZONTAL SURFACE  A horizontal plan 150 feet above the
established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plan coincides
with the perimeter of the horizontal zone.
OBSTRUCTION  Any structure, growth or other object, including a
mobile object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth in § 195-79C.
PRIMARY SURFACE  A surface longitudinally centered on a runway.
When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary
surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway; or when the
runway has no specially prepared hard surface or planned hard surface,
the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The width of the
primary surface is set forth in § 195-79C. The elevation of any point on
the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on
the runway center line.
RUNWAY  A defined area on an airport prepared for landing and
takeoff of aircraft along its length.
TRANSITIONAL SURFACES  These surfaces extend outward at
ninety-degree angles to the runway center line and the runway center
line extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot
vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where
they intersect the horizontal surface.
UTILITY RUNWAY  A runway that is constructed for and intended to
be used by propeller-driven aircraft of 12,500 pounds maximum gross
weight and less.
VISUAL RUNWAY  A runway intended solely for the operation of
aircraft using visual approach procedures.
C. Establishment of airport control zones. In order to carry out the
provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created and established
certain zones that include all of the land lying beneath the approach
§ 195-79 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-79
1:687
surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces
as they apply to the Rostraver Airport. These airport zones are shown
as an overlay on the Official Zoning Map kept on file by officials of the
Township of Rostraver, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, which is
made a part hereof. An area located in more than one of the following
zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive
height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined
as follows:
(1) Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and
is 250 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to
a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the
primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line
of the runway.
(2) Transitional zones: slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 150
feet above the airport elevation which is 1,230 feet above mean sea
level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height
limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface and
extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
(3) Horizontal zone: established at 150 feet above the airport elevation
or at a height of 1,380 feet above mean sea level.
(4) Conical zone: slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet
above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet
above the airport elevation; here: 1,580 feet.
(5) Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this section or chapter shall
be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any
structure or growth of any tree to a height up to 50 feet above the
surface of the land.
D. Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter,
no use may be made of land or water within any airport zone
established by this section which creates electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and
aircraft; makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and others; results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport;
impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport; creates bird strike
hazards; or otherwise in any way endangers or interferes with the
landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
E. Nonconformance.
(1) The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed
to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of
§ 195-79 ROSTRAVER CODE § 195-79
1:688
any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the
effective date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall
require any change in the construction, alteration or intended
use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was
begun prior to the effective date of this section and is diligently
prosecuted.
(2) Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or
tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and
maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be
deemed necessary by municipal, state or federal airport officials to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall
be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the official
body responsible for their placement.
F. Future uses.
(1) Except as specifically provided hereunder, no material change shall
be made in the use of land and no structure shall be erected or
otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a zoning
permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted consistent
with the requirements of § 195-79. Each application for a zoning
permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired,
with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether
the resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. No permit for a use inconsistent with the
provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless a variance has
been approved in accordance with § 195-97C.
(a) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for
such zones.
(b) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of
the runway, no permit shall be required for any structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
such structure would extend above the height limit prescribed
for such approach zones.
(c) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any
construction or alteration of any structure in excess of any of
the height limits established by this chapter.
§ 195-79 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-79
1:689
§ 195-80. Design review requirement.
(2) Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a
nonconforming use or structure to become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit
is made.
(3) Requests for variances. Any request for a variance in accordance
with § 195-97C of this chapter shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the
effect of the proposal of the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Additionally, no
application for a variance to the requirements of this chapter may
be considered by the Zoning Hearing Board unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the appropriate Rostraver Airport
official or owners for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the
requested variance. If the appropriate Rostraver Airport official
does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the
Zoning Hearing Board may act on its own to grant or deny said
application.
(4) Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted
may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of
this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so
conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in
question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense,
such markings and lights as may be necessary.

are permitted by conditional use in certain zoning districts, at a
height necessary to satisfy their function in the applicant's wireless
communications system. No applicant shall have the right under
these regulations to erect a tower to the maximum height specified
in this section unless it proves the necessity for such height. The
applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed communications
tower is the minimum height necessary for its service area.
§ 195-81 ROSTRAVER CODE § 195-81
1:698
(a) Prior to the Township Board of Commissioners' consideration
of a conditional use application authorizing the construction
and installation of a communications tower, it shall be
incumbent upon the applicant for such conditional use
approval to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Township Board of Commissioners that the applicant cannot
adequately extend or infill its communications system by the
use of equipment such as redoes, repeaters, communications
antennas, and other similar equipment installed on existing
structures, such as utility poles or their appurtenances and
other available tall structures. The applicant shall further
demonstrate that the proposed communications tower must be
located where it is proposed in order to serve the applicant's
service area and that no other viable alternative location
exists.
(b) The conditional use application shall be accompanied by a
propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed tower
or other communication facilities and equipment, a description
of the type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/
radio equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band)
assigned to the applicant, the power in watts at which the
applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests conducted
by the applicant in determining the need for the proposed site
and installation.
(c) The conditional use application shall be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed
communications tower complies with all state and federal laws
and regulations concerning aviation safety.
(d) Where the communications tower is located on a property with
another principal use, the applicant shall present
documentation to the Township Board of Commissioners that
the owner of the property has granted an easement for the
proposed communications tower and that vehicular access will
be provided to the facility.
(e) The conditional use application shall be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed
communications tower complies with all applicable provisions
in this chapter.
(4) Engineer inspection. Prior to the Township Board of
Commissioners' issuance of a permit authorizing construction and
erection of a communications tower, a structural engineer
registered in Pennsylvania shall issue to the Township a written
certification of the proposed communications tower's ability to
meet the structural standards offered by either the Electronic
Industries Association or the Telecommunication Industry
Association and certify the proper construction of the foundation
§ 195-81 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-81
1:699
and the erection of the structure. This certification shall be
provided during the conditional use proceedings before the
Township Board of Commissioners or, at a minimum, be made as a
condition attached to any approval given such that the certification
be provided prior to issuance of any zoning permits.
(5) Visual appearance. All communications towers and related
equipment shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible
with the surrounding environment and shall maximize the use of a
like facade to blend with the existing surroundings and neighboring
buildings to the greatest extent possible. The Township Board of
Commissioners shall consider whether its decision upon the subject
application will promote the harmonious and orderly development
of the zoning district and/or surrounding area involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development existing
in the area; benefit neighboring properties by preventing a
negative impact on the aesthetic character of the community;
preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site to the greatest
possible extent; and encourage sound engineering and
construction principles, practices and techniques.

tower shall first demonstrate that the proposed communications
tower cannot be accommodated on land or structures owned by the
Township of Rostraver. If such accommodation is not possible, the
applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed tower cannot be
sited on structures already approved for the placement of wireless
facilities. The Township Board of Commissioners may deny an
application to construct a new communications tower if the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount a
communications antenna on an existing structure. The applicant
shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures,
buildings, and towers within a one-quarter-mile radius of the site
proposed, sought permission to install a communications antenna
on those structures, buildings, and towers and was denied for one
of the following reasons:
(a) The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed
the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or
tower, and its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a
reasonable cost.
(b) The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for
that existing building, structure, or tower and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate
the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended
function.

(d) A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached
with the owner of such building, structure, or tower.
(7) Permit required for modifications. To the extent permissible under
applicable state and federal law, any applicant proposing the
modification of an existing communications tower, which
substantially changes the overall height of such wireless support
structure, shall first obtain a zoning permit from the Township.
(8) Gap in coverage or capacity. The applicant must demonstrate that a
significant gap in wireless coverage or capacity exists in the
applicable area and that the type of communications tower being
proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill that gap. The
existence or nonexistence of a gap in wireless coverage or capacity
shall be a factor in the Township Board of Commissioners' decision
on an application for approval of a communications tower.
(9) Additional communications antennas. The applicant shall provide
the Township with a written commitment that it will allow other
service providers to co-locate communications antennas on
communications towers where technologically and economically
feasible. To the extent permissible under federal and state law, the
owner of a communications tower shall not install any additional
communications antennas without obtaining the prior written
approval of the Township.
(10)Wind. All communications towers shall be designed to withstand
the effects of wind gusts of at least 100 miles per hour in addition to

§ 195-92. Zoning permit.
A. The Zoning Officer shall administer and enforce this chapter, including

of zoning permits. No zoning permit shall be issued by said officer
except where the provisions of this chapter have been complied with.
The Zoning Officer shall meet the qualifications established by the
Township.
(1) The duties of the Zoning Officer shall include, but not be limited to,
the following:
(a) Receive applications required by the Zoning Ordinance.
(b) Inspect premises.
(c) Issue zoning permits and certificates of occupancy.
(d) Maintain records of all official duties.
(2) All permits issued by the Zoning Officer shall be in accordance with
the literal provisions of this chapter.

Rostraver, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, and shall not hold any
elective office in the Township.
A. No building or structure, including mobile home, shall be erected,
added to or structurally altered until a permit therefor has been issued
by the Zoning Officer. All applications for zoning permits shall be in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter, and unless upon
written order of the Zoning Hearing Board, no such zoning permit shall
be issued for any building where said construction, addition or
alteration for use thereof would be in violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter. Remodeling or improvement of an existing building that
does not alter the basic structure, create additional lot area coverage or
change the use of the parcel or building is exempt from this specific
requirement. A zoning permit shall be required prior to any of the
following:
(1) The erection, construction or structural alteration of any building,
structure, dwelling or portion thereof.
(2) The moving of a structure into the districts or from one place in the
district to another.

copies of a layout or plot plan drawn to scale showing the actual
dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the exact size and location of the

information as may be deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer to
determine and provide for the enforcement of this chapter.

D. Zoning permits issued for the purpose of permitting construction,
reconstruction, alterations, repairs, use or the like shall automatically

activity, use or change for which the original permit was used, a new
zoning permit must be obtained. If, however, the construction,
alteration, reconstruction, repairing, use or the like has been
proceeding in a constant and regular manner and, due to the extent and
size of the subject project, it is impossible for the applicant to complete
said process prior to the expiration of 12 months or because of an act of
nature, no new permit must be obtained. However, the applicant must
advise the Zoning Officer of said expiration and advise as to the reason
for failure to complete within the specified time period. In the event
that said applicant fails to notify the Zoning Officer of said failure to
complete, then said permit shall immediately expire and no further
activity may take place unless a new permit is obtained.
E. If, after the issuance of a zoning permit, no construction or other
process is instituted, said permit shall terminate immediately 12
months from the date of issuance as stated above.

inspection during the prosecution of the work and until completion of
the same.

request of the proposed use, provided that the use is in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter and other effective and applicable

have been inspected by the Zoning Officer or his delegate and,
thereafter, a determination has been made that the premises are in

E. No premises, structure or land use activity requiring a zoning permit
shall be used or occupied until such time as an occupancy permit has
been granted. If the applicant desires to make use of the premises or
project prior to its completion, the same is strictly prohibited until such
time as an application has been made for an occupancy permit and all
rules and regulations pertaining thereto and as contained herein have
been determined by the Zoning Officer to have been met.
F. If the project has not been completed and a partial use or occupation of
the premises is desired by the applicant, the applicant must first make
application to the Zoning Officer. Once the Zoning Officer has
determined compliance for the limited or partial use intended, said
applicant may use and/or occupy the premises; however, nothing
contained in this provision shall be interpreted or used as an excuse or
viewed as a waiver of any of the other terms contained hereinabove
pertaining to the expiration of any and all certificates for purposes of
completion of the original project.

intended that a temporary or seasonal use shall be located anywhere

be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the health,
safety, morals and general welfare. This chapter is not intended to interfere
with or abrogate or annul other rules, regulations or ordinances of the
E. If the Township Commissioners determine that the Zoning Ordinance or
any portion thereof is substantially invalid, it shall take the following
actions.
(1) Declare by formal action the Zoning Ordinance or portions thereof
substantively invalid and propose to prepare a curative amendment
to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days following such
declaration and proposal, the governing body shall:
(a) By resolution make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of the Zoning Ordinance.
(b) Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to the
Zoning Ordinance to correct the declared invalidity.
(2) Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal,
enact a curative amendment to validate or reaffirm the validity of
the Zoning Ordinance.
F. Zoning amendments shall not be enacted unless notice of proposed
enactment is given. The notices shall include the time and place of the
meeting at which passage will be considered and a reference to a place
within the Township where copies of the proposed ordinance or
amendment may be examined either without charge or for a charge not
greater than the cost thereof. The governing body shall publish the
proposed ordinance or amendment in one newspaper of general
circulation in the municipality not more than 60 days nor less than
seven days prior to passage. Publication of the proposed ordinance or
amendment shall include either the full text thereof or the title and a
brief summary, prepared by the Municipal Solicitor and setting forth all
the provisions in reasonable detail. If the full text is not included:
(1) A copy thereof shall be supplied to a newspaper of general
circulation in the Township at the time the public notice is
published.
(2) An attested copy of the proposed ordinance shall be filed in the
Westmoreland County Law Library.
(3) In the event that substantial changes are made in the proposed
amendment, before voting upon enactment, the governing body
shall, at least 10 days prior to enactment, readvertise, in one
newspaper of general circulation in the Township, a brief summary
setting forth all the provisions in reasonable detail, together with a
summary of the amendments.
§ 195-98 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-99
1:725
Township of Rostraver, provided that where this chapter imposes a greater
restriction upon the use of building or premises or upon the height of a
building or requires larger open spaces than are imposed by other such
rules, regulations or ordinances, the provision of this chapter shall prevail.
§ 195-100. Remedies.
In case any structure or land is or is proposed to be erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained and/or used in violation of
this chapter or any regulations made pursuant thereto, the Township
Commissioners, in addition to specifically authorizing the Zoning Officer
to obtain enforcement and in addition to other remedies, may institute in
the name of the municipality, by itself or through the Zoning Officer, any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such
building structure, land or use or to prevent in or about such premises any
act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation.
§ 195-101. Violations and penalties.
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon being
found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by
Rostraver Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500, plus all court
costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Rostraver Township
as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the District
Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
Rostraver Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute
a separate violation, unless the District Justice determining that there has
been a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or appropriation violating this chapter to have believed
that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date
of the determination of a violation by the District Justice, and thereafter,
each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees collected for the violation
of this chapter shall be paid over to Rostraver Township.
