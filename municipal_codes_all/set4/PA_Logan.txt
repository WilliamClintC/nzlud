Part 5
LOITERING
§ 501. Purpose and Intent. [Ord. 04-24-08A]
The Township of Logan finds and determines as follows:
A. Certain individuals, whether under or over the age of 18 years, require
a disproportionate amount of police responses with many calls
requiring response to maintain order and public peace and safety and
to stop loitering at public places and/or business property so that there
is less police personnel and resources available for other locations,
emergencies and duties within the Township, thereby placing a
disproportionate and unfair burden upon the residents of the Township.
B. In many instances, the Parents/Guardians and/or Persons standing in
Loco Parentis to individuals violating this Part are aware of and/or
indifferent to such individuals under the age of 18 years participating in
loitering at public places and/or on business properties such as
shopping malls and other commercial establishments.
C. Parents/Guardians and/or Persons standing in Loco Parentis of
individuals under age 18 years have a responsibility to oversee and
control the actions of such individuals under 18 years to minimize
required police service to maintain order and public peace and safety
and to stop such loitering and/or unreasonable noise, tumultuous
behavior, profane language and/or physically offensive condition that
causes or is likely to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm,
to minimize the burden upon the residents of the Township and to
promote the health, safety and welfare of the public in general.
D. Parents/Guardians and/or Persons standing in Loco Parentis can
minimize required police responses to maintain order and public peace
and safety and to stop such loitering and public inconvenience by
diligent and careful oversight of such individuals under the age of 18
years.
E. Individuals over the age of 18 years participating in loitering and/or
creating a physically offensive condition in public places and/or on
business properties also have the duty to minimize required police
responses by not participating in such behavior and thereby minimize
the burden upon the residents of the Township and to promote the
health, safety and welfare of the public in general.
F. Assessment of a fine for subsequent police responses as provided in this
Part is reasonable and will have a deterrent effect and encourage more
responsible behavior on the part of those committing violations of this
Part as well as Parents/Guardians and/or Persons standing in Loco
Parentis to individuals under the age of 18 years.

§ 301. Identification. [Ord. No. 11-08-18]
§ 302. Description and Special Requirements of Identified
Floodplain Areas. [Ord. No. 11-08-18]
1. The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of the Township of Logan, classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated March 2,
2012, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital
data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Township of Logan and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
1. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
A. The Floodway Area/District identified as floodway in the FIS/FIRM
which represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation
by more than one foot at any point. This term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other available
studies or sources of information for those special floodplain areas
where no floodway has been identified in the FIS/FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall not be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge; and
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
§ 301 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 302
1:109
§ 303. Changes in Identification of Area. [Ord. No. 11-08-18]
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Township
of Logan where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(2) The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA and for which base flood elevations have
been provided in the FIS but no floodway has been delineated.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction,
development, use, or activity within any AE Area/District
without floodway unless it is demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any
point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection regional office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
1% annual chance flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state,
or other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
(1) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant
to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall
be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
§ 302 LOGAN CODE § 303
1:110
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 304. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. No. 11-08-18]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Logan Township Floodplain
Administrator, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination
may appeal to the Logan Township Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of
proof shall be on the applicant.
§ 305. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes. [Ord. No. 11-08-18]
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in

The owners of all buildings or property within Logan Township to which
street numbers have been assigned by the Blair County 9-1-1 System and
U.S. Postal System shall have the street number prominently displayed at
all times in accordance with the following standards. For purposes of this
Part a "street number" is an address number established in accordance with
the County wide 9-1-1 system with reference to the adjacent road or street,
assigned and given to a particular building or property by the Blair County
9-1-1 Agency and U.S. Postal Service.
§ 402 LOGAN CODE § 403
1:160
§ 404. Private Road Name Signs. [Ord. 08-23-01]
The owner or owners of all private drives, roadways or easements used for
vehicle access to multiple properties where the drives and roadways are
not recognized as Township roads and which is referenced in the address of
property owners whose residence or business abuts said private drives or
roadways shall, in addition to the other requirements set forth in this Part,
maintain and replace (in the exact location established by the Township)
when needed, the sign and sign post, which shall be initially erected by
the Township, at the Township's cost, which identifies the private road or
private drive name as adopted by the Township.
§ 405. Prohibited Activity. [Ord. 08-23-01]
It shall be unlawful to cover, conceal, obstruct, destroy, remove, deface
or vandalize any street number or road/street name sign or placard and
any post containing the same, installed or displayed pursuant to and in
accordance with the requirements of this Part.
A. Each building to which a street number has been assigned shall have a
street number displayed upon the building except that for buildings
which are located a distance greater than 50 feet from the nearest
public roadway or upon which signage cannot be attached which would
be readable from the nearest public roadway by reason of natural or
manmade obstructions. The owner of said property shall be required to
provide posted signage within 20 feet of the public roadway, which post
shall have affixed thereon the street number which has been assigned
to the building, or such other posted sign as may be approved by the
Township.
B. The assigned street numbers shall be either affixed directly to the
building or post or displayed upon a sign affixed to the building or post.
The street number shall be displayed in such a manner that the
numbers will contrast in color with the background and will be
observed and readable from the nearest public or private roadway. All
numbers shall be in standard arabic numerals, not less than four inches
in height and not less than 1/2 inch in width, or such sizes as may be
approved by the Township. It is recommended that the numbers be
reflective for greater nighttime visibility.
C. If, for any reason, the street number of a particular building is not
readily identifiable by posted sign along the roadway whether due to
the proximity of multiple buildings with different street numbers or
some other reason, then the street number should be affixed to the
building as well as posted by the road. Similarly, if a single building has
multiple street numbers or apartment numbers such as a professional
building or apartments, a building directory should be posted at the
main entrance of the building.
§ 403 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 406
1:161
§ 406. Enforcement. [Ord. 08-23-01]
Upon determining that a building or property owner has not complied
with the street numbering or road name sign regulations of this Part, the
Township, through the Code Enforcement Officer, or such other person as
may be designated by the Township Manager from time to time, may pursue
any of the following enforcement remedies:
A. Provide written notice to the owners, occupants and other persons in
possession of buildings or property which has not been numbered in
accordance with these regulations, of the violation, the need to comply,
and the time within which compliance must be accomplished.
B. In the event that persons persist in refusing to comply with these
regulations despite notices to do so, the Township Code Enforcement
Officer may issue a written order directing the owners, occupants or
others in possession of the buildings or property in violation of this Part
to comply with the applicable requirements of this Part. Any person who
is aggrieved by any order issued pursuant to this Part may appeal to the
Township Supervisors by filing a written notice of appeal with the office
of the Township Manager within 10 days of the date of the subject
order. The Township Supervisors shall, within 45 days of the receipt of
the written notice schedule a time, during a public meeting of the
Supervisors, to consider the said written appeal, and any other
comments offered by said person and, at said public meeting, or such
later date established by the Supervisors not later than 14 days
thereafter, either affirm, reverse and/or modify the order of the Code
Enforcement Officer. Notice of the public meeting date and time shall
be given to the person filing the appeal at least 10 days in advance of
said meeting.
C. In the event the property owners or occupants or possessors fail or
refuse to take action in accordance with the notice and an order issued
pursuant to this Part, the Township may provide the sign, as necessary,
in order to bring the property owner(s) into compliance with the
standards promulgated in this Part. The Township may recover the cost
of materials and labor for the purchase and installation of sign from the
property owners, occupants or possessors and reasonable
administrative fees, interest or other charges allowed by law. In the
event the owners, occupants or possessors of the subject property fail
to pay the cost of such installation as determined and approved, then
the Township may institute proceedings at law to collect the full costs
together with all penalties, interest, fees, and other charges which are
authorized by applicable law, or may take action to assess these costs
and charges against the premises and the owners thereof and collect
same as a municipal lien or may take other action to collect these sums

the construction and operation of outdoor furnaces within the limits of the
Township of Logan for the purpose of securing and promoting the public
health, comfort, convenience, safety, welfare and prosperity of the Township

Part 1
STUDENT RENTAL UNIT OCCUPANCY REGULATIONS
§ 101. Purpose and Intent. [Ord. 02-13-14A]
It is the purpose of this Part and the policy of the Board of Supervisors of the
Township of Logan (Township), in order to protect and promote the public
health, safety and welfare of its citizens, to establish rights and obligations
of owners and occupants relating to the rental of certain dwelling units and
dormitory units in the Township and to encourage owners and occupants
to maintain and improve the quality of student rental housing within the
community. It is also the policy of the Township that owners, managers
and occupants share responsibilities to obey the various codes adopted
to protect and promote public health, safety and welfare. As a means
to those ends, this Part provides for a system of inspections, issuance
and renewal of occupancy licenses, and sets penalties for violations. This
Part shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its purposes and
policies. Although the Board of Supervisors of the Township acknowledges
the significant contribution that educational institutions, their students,
faculty and staff make to the culture and economy of the Township and
surrounding area, in recent years, adverse effects of student housing on
residential neighborhoods have increased, and there has been an increase
in destructive student behavior that threatens the health, safety and welfare
of the student citizens and nonstudent citizens of the Township. Accordingly,
in considering the adoption of this Part, the Township makes the following
findings:
A. When compared to other unrelated cohabitating individuals and
traditional families, groups of students have different hours, work and
social habits and frequently cause noise, disturbances and problems in
residential neighborhoods.
B. There is a greater incidence of violations of various codes of the
Township at residential properties where owners rent such property to
students.
C. There is a greater incidence of disturbances which adversely affect the
peace and quiet of the neighborhood at residential properties where
owners rent to students than at owner-occupied residential properties,
family-occupied residential rental properties or residential properties
that are occupied by unrelated persons who are not students.
D. A concentration of student homes changes the character of a
neighborhood from one with traditional family values to one that cannot
maintain those; and most of the Township's student homes are
concentrated in the Juniata Gap and Grandview areas of the Township,
which displaces middle- and lower-income housing by absorbing
housing units and rendering the remaining units less desirable for
more-traditional residential use.
§ 101 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 101
1:171
§ 102. Definitions. [Ord. 02-13-14A]
For the purpose of interpreting the provisions of this Part, the following
words shall have the meaning or meanings ascribed. All other words not
defined herein shall be used with a meaning of standard usage. Words
used in the present tense include the future tense; the singular number
E. Since January 2003, 1,701 reports of disruptive conduct under the
Township's Disorderly Gathering Ordinance involving student behavior
have been filed.
F. Since January 2003, the Township emergency service providers have
responded to 238 false fire alarms to student housing units.
G. Since January 2003, 1,097 prosecutions for underage drinking have
been filed against students, and 70 prosecutions were filed against
nonstudent residents of the Township.
H. Since January 2003, 290 student parties have been raided where
arrests were made for underage drinking and furnishing alcohol to
minors.
I. There are sufficient differences between student housing and
nonstudent housing and the behavior of students and nonstudent
residents to justify different regulations for each class of resident.
J. There is a significant occurrence of disruptive behavior in dwelling
units occupied by students as compared to dwelling units that are
occupied by owners, traditional families or unrelated persons who are
not students.
K. Students who remain in the occupancy of the premises for periods of
time after they are no longer students contribute to the abovedescribed
problems.
L. Because of the demand for student housing in the Township, developers
have expressed interest in developing properties for use as student
homes.
M. Dormitory-type uses are not covered by the Regulated Rental Unit
Occupancy Ordinance, which applies only to dwelling units.
N. The Board of Supervisors of the Township is desirous of providing the
same protection and standards for students who reside in dormitories
or dwelling units.
O. The Board of Supervisors of the Township is desirous of imposing the
same responsibilities upon owners of dormitory units and dwelling units
where students reside.
P. The Board of Supervisors of the Township finds that Penn State Altoona
has sufficient resources and interest to properly manage dormitories
owned by it, and there is no need to regulate such dormitories.

rental unit or dormitory unit shall regulate the conduct and activity of
the occupants thereof, both contractually and through enforcement, as

diminishing or relieving, in any way, the responsibility of occupants or

nor shall it be construed as an assignment, transfer or projection over
or onto any owner of any responsibility or liability which occupants or
their guests may have as a result of their conduct or activity under

owner to indemnify or defend occupants or their guests when any such
action or proceeding is brought against the occupant based upon the
occupant's conduct or activity. Nothing herein is intended to impose
any additional civil/criminal liability upon owners other than that which

applicable codes of the Township and shall regularly perform all
routine maintenance, including lawn mowing and ice and snow

occupant relieve an owner of any responsibility under this Part or
other ordinances or codes for maintenance of premises.

A. Written Rental Agreement Required. All rental agreements for
regulated dwelling units or dormitory units shall be in writing and
shall be supplemented with the addendum attached hereto as

rental agreement may provide that the occupant, and/or the
individual(s) executing the rental agreement as lessee if not an

under this Part. A provision prohibited by this subsection included

C. Creating hazardous or physically offensive conditions by any act
which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.
9. Enforcement.

to judgment and enforced and collected as provided by law, together
with interest at the legal rate and court costs. The remedies provided by
this subsection are not exclusive, and the Township and its Code

permitting and inspection requirements of this Part, pursuant to
any other ordinance or code.
D. If, upon the initial inspection, violations of the codes of the

license until a time set by the Code Enforcement Officer or
Township Board of Supervisors.
C. Suspension: the immediate loss of the privilege to rent regulated
rental units or dormitory units for a period of time set by the Code
Enforcement Officer or Township Board of Supervisors. The owner,

renewal without the need to show cause why the owner's privilege
to apply for a license should be reinstated. Upon suspension, the
owner shall take immediate steps to evict the occupants.
D. Revocation: the immediate loss of the privilege to rent regulated
rental units or dormitory units for a period of time set by the Code
Enforcement Officer or the Township Board of Supervisors and the
loss of the privilege to apply for renewal of the license at the
expiration of the time period. Upon the loss of the privilege to rent,
the owner shall take immediate steps to evict the occupants.
3. Criteria for Applying Discipline.

prevent future violations, including any written plan submitted
by the owner.
(7) The policies and lease language employed by the owner to
manage the regulated dwelling unit or dormitory unit to enable
the owner to comply with the provisions of this Part.
B. In addition to applying discipline as set forth above, the Code
Enforcement Officer may recommend and Township Board of
Supervisors may impose upon the existing or subsequent licenses
reasonable conditions related to fulfilling the purposes of this Part.
4. Grounds for Imposing Discipline. Any of the following may subject an
owner to discipline as provided for in this Part:
A. Failure to abate a violation of Township codes and ordinances that
apply to the premises within the time directed by the Code
Enforcement Officer.
B. Refusal to permit the inspection of the premises by the Code
Enforcement Officer and/or police as required by § 105, Subsection

§ 103 of this Part.
F. Three violations of this Part or other ordinances of the Township

this Part, there need be no criminal conviction before a violation
can be found to exist. Before a prior violation can be considered
under this section, the owner must have received notice, in writing,
of this violation within 30 days after the Code Enforcement Officer
received notice of the violation.
5. Procedure for Nonrenewal, Suspension or Revocation of License.
A. Notification. Following a determination that grounds for
nonrenewal, suspension or revocation of a license exist, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall notify the owner of the action to be taken
and the reason therefor.
§ 106 LOGAN CODE § 106
1:186
(1) Such notification shall be in writing, addressed to the owner in
question, and shall contain the following information:

beginning July 1, or that the owner will receive a formal
warning. In the case of a suspension or revocation, the
notice shall state the date upon which such suspension or
revocation will commence, and in the case of a suspension
shall also state the duration of said suspension.
(d) A statement that, due to the nonrenewal, suspension or
revocation (as the case may be), the owner or any person

more than two unrelated individuals subject to said
enforcement action, from and during the period said
action is in effect.

notice, a detailed statement of the appeal, including the
grounds therefor and the reason(s) alleged as to why the
determination of the Code Enforcement Officer is
incorrect or should be overturned, and a statement of
relief requested by the appellant. Such notice of appeal
may be required to be submitted on a form to be
prescribed therefor by the Township Board of Supervisors,
to be signed by the appellant. There is hereby imposed a
fee for filing of such appeals, the amount of which shall be
determined and established, from time to time, by
resolution of the Township.
(2) Upon receipt of such an appeal in proper form, accompanied
with the requisite filing fee, the Township Secretary shall
schedule a hearing, not less than 10 days from the date on

appeal, which shall be conducted in accordance with the Local
Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 551-555, as amended, and any
amendments thereto. The appellant and all other parties
having an interest may be heard. Based on the facts and
arguments of the appellant and of the Code Enforcement
Officer and any police or other public officials involved, and
any relevant factual presentations of other parties, the
Township Board of Supervisors shall make a decision either
affirming, reversing or modifying the action of the Code
Enforcement Officer from which the appeal was taken. Such
decision shall be rendered at a public meeting either
immediately following the hearing or within 30 days thereafter.
The decision shall be reduced to writing, stating clearly the
factual and legal basis for the decision, within 45 days after the
hearing. If the Township Board of Supervisors deems it
necessary or desirable, it may continue the hearing to a
subsequent time and date not later than 30 days from the
initial hearing, which time and date shall be openly announced
at the initial hearing, and in such case, the time limits for
rendering the decision and reducing it to writing set forth
herein shall be calculated from the last hearing date (at which
the substance of the decision is orally announced).
B. Delivery of Notification.
(1) All notices shall be sent to the owner and manager, if
applicable, by certified mail and/or certificate of mailing. In the
event that the notice is returned by the postal authorities
marked "unclaimed" or "refused," then the Code Enforcement
Officer shall attempt delivery by personal service on the owner
or manager, if applicable. The Code Enforcement Officer shall
also post the notice at a conspicuous place on the premises.
(2) If personal service cannot be accomplished after a reasonable
attempt to do so, then the notice may be sent to the owner or
manager at the address stated on the most-current license
application for the premises in question, by regular first-class
mail, postage prepaid. If such notice is not returned by the
postal authorities within five days of its deposit in the United
States mail, then it shall be deemed to have been delivered to
and received by the addressee on the fifth day following its
deposit in the United States mail, and all applicable time
periods set forth herein shall thereupon be calculated from
said fifth day.

1. Basis for Violation. It shall be unlawful for any person, as either owner
or manager of a regulated rental unit or dormitory unit for which a
license is required, to operate without a valid, current license issued by
the Township authorizing such operation. It shall also be unlawful for

Part which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a
separate offense.
3. Nonexclusive Remedies. The penalty provisions of this section and the
license nonrenewal, suspension and revocation procedures provided in
this Part shall be independent, non-mutually-exclusive separate
remedies, all of which shall be available to the Township as may be
deemed appropriate for carrying out the purposes of this Part. The
remedies and procedures provided in this Part for violation hereof are
not intended to supplant or replace to any degree the remedies and
procedures available to the Township in the case of a violation of any
other code or ordinance of the Township, whether or not such other
code or ordinance is referenced in this Part and whether or not an
ongoing violation of such other code or ordinance is cited as the
underlying ground for a finding of a violation of this Part.
1. Notices.
A. For purposes of this Part, any notice required hereunder to be
given to a manager shall be deemed as notice given to the owner.
B. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any notice required to
be given to the owner under this Part shall have been received by
such owner if the notice was given to the owner in the manner
provided by this Part.

hereunder cited shall be no defense to license nonrenewal,
suspension or revocation proceedings as long as all notices
prerequisite to institution of such proceedings have been given and
deemed received in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Part.
§ 107 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 108
1:189
2. Changes in Ownership Occupancy. It shall be the duty of each owner of
a regulated rental unit or dormitory unit to notify the Code
Enforcement Officer, in writing, of any change in ownership of the
premises or of the number of regulated rental units or dormitory units
on the premises. It shall also be the duty of the owner to notify the Code
Enforcement Officer in writing of any increase in the number of
occupants in any regulated rental unit or dormitory unit or of the
changing of a dwelling unit from owner-occupied to non-owneroccupied,
which thereby transforms the dwelling into a regulated rental
unit or dormitory unit for purposes of this Part.
3. Owners Severally Responsible. If any regulated rental unit or dormitory
unit is owned by more than one person, in any form of joint tenancy, as a
partnership or otherwise, each person shall be jointly and severally
responsible for the duties imposed under the terms of this Part and
shall be severally subject to prosecution for the violation of this Part.
4. Confidentiality of Leases. The Township shall keep copies of leases that
it retains in confidence and shall not disclose their contents except as

CRUISING IN THE TOWNSHIP
§ 701. Title. [Ord. 6-11-92]
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Logan Township Cruising
Ordinance."
§ 702. Legislative Findings and Purpose. [Ord. 6-11-92]
The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that certain commercial areas of the
Township are experiencing threats to the public health, safety and welfare
of its residents, as well as the public in general, arising from the ongoing
congestion resulting from consistent and repetitive unnecessary use and
driving of motor vehicles on traffic ways within the several shopping centers
and malls within the Township of Logan. Furthermore, it is specifically the
finding of the Board of Supervisors that, although the said shopping centers
and malls located within the Township are situated on private property, due
to the voluminous and constant interaction by the public with the retail
merchants, said shopping centers and malls are in effect quasi-public areas
requiring protection of the health, safety and welfare of the public. The
purpose of this Part is to reduce the dangerous traffic congestion, as well as
the excess noise and pollution resulting from such unnecessary repetitive
driving, to insure sufficient access for emergency vehicles to and through
the designated thoroughfares now hampered by this repetitive driving of
motor vehicles and to safeguard the voluminous number of pedestrians
frequenting the shopping centers and malls located in the Township.
§ 703. Definitions. [Ord. 6-11-92]
For the purpose of this Part, the following definitions shall apply:
CRUISING  Driving a motor vehicle on a traffic way past a traffic control
point, as designated by the Logan Township Police Department from time
to time, more than twice in any two-hour period, between the hours of 3:00
p.m. and 6:00 a.m., on any day of the week. The passing of a designated
control point a third time under the aforesaid conditions shall constitute
unnecessary repetitive driving and therefore a violation of this Part.
DESIGNATED AREA  Any traffic way located within or around any parking
lot of any shopping center or mall located within the Township of Logan.
These designated traffic ways shall be clearly marked with signs advising
the public that the area is subject to regulation under this Part.
SHOPPING CENTER OR MALL  Any real estate located in Logan
Township upon which there is erected a building or buildings wherein
commercial retail establishments are or are intended to be located
including, but not limited to, the Logan Valley Mall, K-Mart Plaza, the
Pleasant Valley Shopping Center, Park Hills Plaza, Morningside Plaza,
Orchard Plaza and Greenwood Center.
§ 701 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 703

TRAFFIC CONTROL POINT  A clearly identified reference point on a
designated traffic way, as determined and identified from time to time by

TRAFFIC WAY  Any area within a shopping center or mall parking lot not
used or intended for parking or marked as a parking space and which said
area is for the use of a motor vehicle to either gain access to or leave said
shopping center or mall or for access or leaving any of the parking areas
and spaces of a shopping center or mall.
§ 704. Cruising Prohibited. [Ord. 6-11-92]
No person shall engage in unnecessary repetitive driving, also known for
purposes of this Part as "cruising." For purposes of this Part, the person
having control and/or ownership of a motor vehicle shall be considered the
person cruising, without regard as to whether that person was actually
driving the motor vehicle each time it passed the traffic control point.
Having control or ownership of a motor vehicle means either the owner of
the vehicle, as stated on the vehicle registration, if said owner is present in
the vehicle at the time of the violation, or if the owner is not present in the
vehicle, the person operating the vehicle at the time of the violation of this
Part.
§ 705. Exclusions. [Ord. 6-11-92]
This Part shall not apply to any municipal, emergency, police, fire,
ambulance or other governmental vehicle when the same is being operated
in an official capacity. In addition, the Part shall not apply to any duly
licensed public transportation vehicle.
§ 706. Enforcement and Penalty. [Ord. 6-11-92; as amended by Ord.
9-19-96; and by Ord. 2-13-97]
1. Enforcement. Any police officer and/or other person authorized by the
Board of Supervisors may enforce the provisions of this Part.
2. Penalty. Any person who shall violate any provision of this Part shall,
upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $100
and not more than $1,000 plus the cost of prosecution, and/or be
sentenced to imprisonment for a term not to exceed 90 days. Every day
that a violation of this Part continues shall constitute a separate and
distinct offense which shall be subject to the aforesaid penalties.

C. In the cases where the Township determines that imposition of
mass limitations on persons is appropriate, the report required by
Subsection B of § 111(7) shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by Pretreatment Standards in the discharge of said
person. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where requested by the
Township, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable Pretreatment Standards. The frequency of monitoring
shall be prescribed in the applicable Pretreatment Standard, unless
the Township directs more frequent monitoring. All analysis shall
be performed in accordance with procedures established by the
EPA pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto or with other test procedures
approved by the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance
with the techniques approved by the EPA. Where 40 CFR Part 136
does not include a sampling or analysis technique for the pollutant
in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication,
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments
thereto, or with any other sampling and analysis procedures
approved by the EPA.
D. In the case of a slug load as defined by Subsection O of § 112(4) of
this Part 1, it is the responsibility of the person to immediately
notify the Township of the incident. The notification shall include
the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, and corrective actions. Within five days following a slug
load, said person shall submit to the Township detailed written
report describing the cause of the slug load and the measures to be
taken to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve said person of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the public
sanitary sewerage system, fish kills, or other damage to people or
property; nor shall notification relieve the person of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this Part 1 or
other applicable federal, commonwealth, county or municipal law.

any corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazards to
structures, equipment, or personnel of the public sanitary
sewerage system. Where the Township deems it advisable, it may
require any person discharging industrial wastes to install and
maintain, at his own expense, in a manner approved by the
Township or its authorized representative, a suitable device to
continuously measure and record the pH of the wastes so
discharged.
D. Wastes containing any noxious or malodorous gas or substance

the public sanitary sewerage system such as residues, sludges, or
scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere
with the reclamation process. In no case, shall a substance
discharged into the public sanitary sewerage system cause the
public sanitary sewerage to be in noncompliance with the sludge
use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed under
Section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations
affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid
Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substance Control
Act, or Commonwealth of Pennsylvania criteria applicable to the

O. Wastes containing any pollutants, including oxygen demanding
pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow-rate and/or pollutant
concentration which the person knows or has reason to know will
cause interference to the public sanitary sewerage system. In no
case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or
quantities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than
15 minutes more than five times the average twenty-four-hour
concentrations, quantities, or flow during normal operations.
5. No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as
prohibiting any special agreement or arrangement between the
Township and any person whereby any industrial waste of unusual
character may be admitted to the public sanitary sewerage system
either before or after pretreatment by the producer of such industrial
waste. However, in no case, shall the Federal Categorical Pretreatment
Standards for a particular industrial subcategory be modified by such
agreements or arrangements unless the limitations imposed under such
agreements or arrangements are more stringent.

though registered on one meter if the Township so elects.
5. Charges to commercial, industrial, institutional, school or church users.
[Amended by Ord. 09-14-17]
A. Unless a different service charge is otherwise set forth herein, in
the event any commercial, industrial, institutional, school, church
or similar user is discharging sanitary sewage, industrial waste,
water or other liquids into the public sanitary sewerage system
either directly or indirectly, the service charge to such users shall
be determined by such users water usage as the same may be
measured and/or recorded by any Water Company plus 25% for
expenses and sewer line maintenance.
B. Unless a different service charge is otherwise set forth herein, in
the event any user set forth in Subsection 5A and any residential
user uses water from a source other than a Water Company, then
such users shall be required to install and maintain, for measuring
and/or recording, a meter as set forth in Specifications for Sanitary
Sewerage System Construction for such water usage at no cost to
the Township and such meters shall be read in the manner and at
times deemed appropriate by the Township. Any such meter that is
15 years or older from and after September 30, 2017, and any such
meters that become 15 years old after that date, shall be replaced
with a new meter complying with the specifications set forth in the
Specifications for Sanitary Sewerage System Construction within
90 days of such date or the date after which the meter becomes 15
years old.
6. In the event that a user is able to prove to the satisfaction of the
Township that a portion of the water measured and/or recorded as set
forth in Subsection 5 of this § 113 does not and cannot enter the public
sanitary sewerage system, the Township may determine, in such
manner and by such method as it, in its sole discretion, may deem
practical, the actual percentage of the metered water entering the
public sanitary sewerage system, or the Township may require or
permit the installation of additional meters in such manner as to
determine either the quantity of water excluded from the public
sanitary sewerage system or the quantity of water, sewage and/or
industrial waste actually entering the public sanitary sewerage system.
The sewerage service charge for the actual percentage of water
§ 113 LOGAN CODE § 113
1:312
§ 114. Surcharge for Certain Industrial Wastes. [Ord. 6-28-73]
calculated in this Subsection 6 shall be based upon the quantity of
water, sewage and/or industrial waste estimated, measured and/or
recorded by the Township to be actually entering the public sanitary
sewerage system and shall be subject to the sewage charge set forth in
§ 113 hereof.
7. Any person requesting consideration for the reduction in the sewerage
service charge because of water not entering the public sanitary
sewerage system shall make written application to the Township for
such consideration, which application shall include the name of the
applicant, Township account number, and supporting data fully
describing other sources of water, if any, as well as disposition of water
alleged not to be entering the sewerage system. The application shall
be accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale showing the plan of
property, water distribution system, sewer layout, existing meters, and
proposed meters in the scheme to determine the quantity of flow
entering or not entering, the sewerage system. The cost of furnishing,
installing and maintaining any meters other than those to measure
water purchased from the Water Company shall be borne by the
applicant. The type, size, location, arrangement and maintenance of
such meters shall be subject to the approval of the Township and the
Water Company.
8. Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall preclude the right of the
Township entering into contracts with neighboring municipalities for
the collection and transportation of their sewage under a schedule of
charges.
9. Billing for sewer service charges for all new construction of any
building, house and/or structure will commence when the certificate of
occupancy is issued for such building, house and/or structure. An
existing building, house and/or structure which is in any way conveyed
to another person shall have all charges for sewerage service paid
through the date of closing on the same and the new owner shall be
responsible for notifying the Township of the change in ownership
within 10 days of such change.
1. Although the Township sewage treatment works will be capable of
treating certain abnormal industrial wastes as hereto before defined in
§ 102 of this Part 1, the actual treatment of such wastes may increase
the cost of operating and maintaining the Township's sewage treatment
works. Therefore, there is hereby levied and assessed against each
person discharging such industrial waste into the Township's public
sanitary sewerage system, a surcharge, or surcharges, which are
intended to cover such additional cost to the Township. Such surcharge
shall be in addition to the regular sewerage service charge set forth in
§ 105 of this chapter, and shall be payable as hereinafter provided and
in the amount hereinafter provided.
§ 113 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 114
1:313
2. The strength of any industrial waste, the discharge of which is to be
subject to surcharge, shall be determined monthly, or more frequently,
from samples taken at the manhole described in § 111(4) or at any other
sampling point mutually agreed to by the Township and the producer of
said waste. The frequency and duration of the sampling period shall be
such as, in the opinion of the Township, will permit a reasonably reliable
determination of the average composition of the said wastes. Samples
shall be collected, by a representative of the Township, in proportion to
the flow of waste and composited for analysis in accordance with the
latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Sewage, as published by the American Public Health Association.
Except as hereinafter provided, the strength of the waste as found by
analysis shall be used for establishing the surcharge, or surcharges
hereinafter provided for. However, the Township may, if it so elects,
accept the results of routine sampling and analysis by the producer of
said wastes in lieu of making its own samplings and analysis.
3. In the event any industrial waste is found, by the Township, to have a
BOD in excess of 300 parts per million, the producer of said waste shall
be surcharged in an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of
wastes in 1,000 gallons per billing period, discharged to the public
sanitary sewerage system and the "BOD surcharge rate". The "BOD
surcharging rate" shall be determined by the Township by the following
formula:
Rc = 0.00834 P (C-300)
Where:
Rc = The BOD surcharge rate in cents per 1,000 gallons of
waste discharged.
P = The average annual fixed, operating and maintenance
cost of secondary treatment processes per pound of BOD
received at the treatment works. Such secondary
processes shall include chlorination as well as activated
sludge processes. (Prior to completion of the first year of
operation, the value of "P" shall assumed to be 0.05
dollars.)
C = The average BOD of the industrial waste expressed in
parts per million as determined in accordance with § 602
of this chapter.
The figure 300 appearing in the above formula corresponds to the
maximum BOD permissible without surcharge. The figure 0.000834 is
the factor to convert parts per million to pounds per 1,000 gallons. No
discount will be permitted for sewage or industrial wastes having a
BOD less than 300 parts per million.
4. In the event any industrial waste, the volume of which is found by the
Township, to have an average suspended solid concentration in excess
of 350 parts per million, the producer of said waste shall be surcharged
§ 114 LOGAN CODE § 114
1:314
§ 115. Construction of System by Developers. [Ord. 6-28-73; as
amended by Ord. 12-27-84; and by Ord. 5-16-96]
an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of waste in 1,000
gallons per billing period, discharged to the public sanitary sewerage
system and the "suspended solids surcharge rate". The "suspended
solids surcharge rate" shall be determined by the Township and by the
following formula:
Rs = 0.00834 B (S - 350)
Where:
Rs = The suspended solids surcharge rate in cents per 1,000
gallons of waste discharged.
B = The average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost
of the sludge digestion, sludge drying and sludge disposal
operations per pound of suspended solids received at the
treatment works. (Prior to the completion of the first year
of operation the value of "B" shall be assumed to be 0.05
dollars.)
S = The average suspended solids concentration of the
abnormal industrial waste, expressed in parts per millions
as determined in accordance with § 114(2).
The figure 350 appearing in the above formula corresponds to the
maximum suspended solids concentration permissible without
surcharge. As before, the figure 0.00834 is the factor to convert parts
per million to pounds per 1,000 gallons. No discount will be permitted
for sewage or industrial wastes having a suspended solids
concentration less than 350 parts per million.
5. The surcharge provided for in this chapter will be added to the normal
sewerage service charge set forth in § 113. They will be billed quarterly
and shall be subject to the same penalty as set forth in § 113(3).
6. In the case of a waste containing substances or materials that can only
be treated by the Township with extra care and costs and where the
surcharge as stated does not apply, the Township may accept the waste
after a study of it has been made and a formula for the discharge has
been made.
7. In the case of wastes containing heavy metals, either in suspension or
solution when in the opinion of the Township the suspended solids do
not represent the true characteristics of the solids loading the Township
reserves the right to use total solids instead of suspended solids for the
surcharge rate provided in § 114(4).
1. Any person (hereinafter, for purposes of this § 115, called "developer")
who desires to construct or build, at said person's sole cost and
expense, a sanitary sewer or sewerage system which is capable of

trailers and/or residential equivalent and/or in the event a sanitary
sewer or sewerage system is proposed to utilize a six-inch or larger
sanitary sewer, and connect such sanitary sewer or sewerage system
with the public sanitary sewerage system shall comply with the
provisions of this § 115.
2. The developer shall execute an agreement, prepared by the Township
Solicitor, with the Township setting forth the obligations of the parties
as determined by the Township, and submit plans for the proposed
extension of the sanitary sewer to the Township in accordance with
Chapter 22 paying the cost of preparation of said agreement.
3. Prior to final acceptance of any sanitary sewer extension by the
Township, the developer shall furnish to the Township "as built plans" in
accordance with Specifications for Sanitary Sewerage System
Construction.
4. Easements for the sanitary sewer shall be recorded in the name of the
Township or the Authority for all sewers to be constructed outside of
dedicated street rights-of-way.
5. All sanitary sewer and/or sewerage system shall be constructed as
specified by Specifications for Sanitary Sewerage System Construction.
6. The Developer shall pay the Township for all costs of inspection of
construction of all sanitary sewers and sewer connections in
accordance with Chapter 1, Part 3, hereof.
7. No sanitary sewer extension constructed by a Developer will be
approved for use and acceptance by the Township until said sanitary
sewer is formally approved by the Township, all collection connections
and inspection fees have been paid, the Township has been reimbursed
in full for all inspection costs incurred for inspection during
construction, testing, approval and all cost set forth in Chapter 1, Part
3, hereof, and the sanitary sewer extension has been dedicated to the
Township and/or the Authority.
A. All fees, penalties and charges imposed, collected and/or received
under this Part 1 of Chapter 18, shall be used solely for the purpose of
operating, maintaining and replacing the public sanitary sewerage
system or the retirement of debt incurred for the same.
B. Vandalism of the public sanitary sewerage system shall be prohibited.
C. Any purchased sewer tap previously placed into service by any person
shall permit said person to connect to, convey and/or discharge sanitary
sewage into the public sanitary sewerage system. In order to retain the
right to connect to, convey and/or discharge sanitary sewage into the

by Ord. 11-08-07A]
public sanitary sewerage system, payment of the rental service charge
must be paid when due in the full amount at all times. In the event
a person desires to no longer connect to, convey and/or discharge
sanitary sewage into the public sanitary sewerage system, said person
shall permanently cap the sewer lateral, per Township specifications, at
the property line and have the same inspected by the Township prior
to in any way covering said capped sewer lateral. If the capped sewer
lateral is approved by the Township, all rights to connect to, convey
and/or discharge sanitary sewage into the public sanitary sewerage
system shall cease, as will all such rental service charges, so long
as the same have been paid to date. In the event a sewer lateral is
desired to be reconnected to the public sanitary sewerage system, a
new sewer tap application shall be filed and appropriate fees (including,
but not limited to, any unpaid rental charges) paid to the Township, at
which point, a new tap may be issued, if the same is available and if in
compliance with all applicable laws and ordinances.
A. Collection of delinquent sanitary sewer charges shall be either through
an action in assumpsit filed against the record owner of the property
receiving service or by use of the scire facias procedure provided for by
53 P.S. § 7101 et seq., as amended from time to time. In the event that
the Township elects to proceed via the scire facias procedure, a
municipal lien shall be filed against the property.
B. Once collection proceedings have begun, the Township shall be entitled
to collect interest at the annual rate of 10% on all overdue sanitary
sewer charges calculated cumulatively from the date of the first unpaid
statement. The interest will be included in any amount collected
through a settlement of the claim or, if a judgment is taken against the
property owner, added to the amount of the lien and made part of the
judgment.
C. The Township shall collect from the property owner all costs associated
with collection of the delinquent account, along with attorneys' fees in
the amount of 15% of the total amount due and owing on the sewer
account, at the time of either settlement of the claim or entry of
judgment on the writ of scire facias.
1. Each sewerage service charge or surcharge levied hereby pursuant to
this Part 1 shall be a debt due the Township of Logan and shall be lien
upon all the property of the user of such service, and if the same is not
paid within 30 days after it shall have been rendered, it shall be deemed
delinquent and may be recovered by civil action in the name of the

on-lot sewage system is located, requiring such owner to pump, inspect
or repair the on-lot sewage system and provide the Township with a
receipt and other specified information documenting the date on which
the on-lot sewage system was pumped, inspected or repaired.
C. Fees. Cost for the municipal administration of the management
program, including maintaining on-lot sewage system information and
monitoring compliance, shall be assessed as stated in § 204M to
property owners included in the program in an amount established by
Township resolution from time to time. It shall be each individual
property owner's responsibility to contract with a licensed sewage
hauler and certified on-lot sewage system inspector for the pumping
and inspection of the on-lot sewage system.
D. Enforcement Remedies. Any person, partnership or corporation who or
which has violated the provisions of this Part shall, upon being found

liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Township, pay a judgment of not less than $100 and not more than
$1,000, plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred
by the Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or
be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of
a violation by the District Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor
timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the District
Justice determining that there has been a violation further determines
that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or
corporation violating this Part to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one
such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the District Justice and thereafter each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
E. Jurisdiction. District Justices shall have initial jurisdiction in
proceedings brought under this Part. However, nothing contained
herein shall be construed or interpreted to prevent the Township from
bringing any other action, including an injunction action to enforce the
provisions hereof.

§ 406. Regulated Discharges. [Ord. 09-25-14]
1. Discharge of stormwaters. No person shall discharge or cause or permit
to be discharged any surface water, groundwater, roof water,
subsurface drainage, building foundation drainage or stormwater from
pavements and areaways into any sanitary sewer. Discharges of
stormwater into combined sewers is allowed to the extent provided by
state, Township and Borough statute and regulation.
2. Storm sewers. No person shall introduce or cause or permit to be
introduced any wastewater, sanitary sewage, or industrial waste into
any storm sewer.
3. Prohibited discharges. No user shall discharge or cause to be
discharged, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which
will interfere with the operation or performance of the sewer system.
These general prohibitions apply to all users, whether or not the users
are subject to any other pretreatment requirements. No person may
discharge any of the following substances to the sewer system:
A. Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their nature or
quantity, are, or may be, sufficient, either alone or by interaction
with other substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in
any other way to the sewer system or to the operation of the sewer
system. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion
hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system (or at any
point in the system) be more than 5% nor any single reading over
10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. At no time shall
the closed-cup flashpoint of the discharged wastewater be less than
140° F. (60° C.) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, the following
substances in concentrations which cause exceedance of the above
standard: gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, ethers, alcohols,
peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, and carbides.

of this Part 4, any discharge that is prohibited under Subsection 3 of
this section shall be considered an unauthorized discharge, and the
Township may take whatever steps are necessary to halt such a
discharge, as set forth in Section 409 of this Part 4 or as otherwise
provided by law.
5. Categorical Standards. If the categorical standards for a particular
industrial user are more stringent than local limits or other
requirements imposed under this Part 4, then the categorical standards
shall apply. The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards as set
forth in 40 CFR Parts 405 et seq. are hereby incorporated into the
industrial pretreatment program as program requirements for those
industrial users subject to such categorical standards.
6. State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than national
requirements and limitations or those established under this Part 4.
7. Local limits. The Township and/or the Borough may establish, and
review from time to time, local limits regulating the discharge of
specific pollutants by industrial users. Local limits developed to prevent
pass through or interference, or to implement prohibitive discharge
standards, shall be approved by the approval authority.
A. Local limits may be established for any substance which is
discharged, or is likely to be discharged, to the sewer system.
B. Local limits may limit concentration, mass, or a combination of the
two.

1:345
C. The procedure for the calculation of local limits may be as
recommended by the approval authority or otherwise considered
appropriate by the Borough.
D. Local limits shall be calculated for pollutants, as deemed necessary,
to prevent interference and pass through. In addition, local limits
may be calculated to prevent the discharge of toxic materials in
toxic amounts; threats to worker health and safety; and physical,
chemical or biological damage to the sewer system; or such other
factors as deemed appropriate by the Township.
E. Local limits are applicable to all significant industrial users and
may be included in wastewater discharge permits. Local limits may
be imposed on discharges from other users as deemed appropriate
by the Township.

partial or complete substitute for adequate pretreatment to achieve
compliance with the limitations contained in applicable categorical
§ 406 LOGAN CODE § 406
1:346
standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation, including local
limits, developed by the Township, Borough or state.
8.1. Best Management Practices. Best management practices (BMPs) will
be required to be submitted by industrial users (IUs), in addition to
numeric values established by local limit, that address all of the
components outlined in the official definition of "BMP" as mentioned
above. The plan will include any documentation pertaining to existing
spill and slug control plans for IUs. BMP requirements and
amendments will be established in SIU control documents (permits), as
applicable. These control documents may be industrial waste permits or
general control mechanisms. Certain IUs, as deemed necessary by the
Borough, shall be required to follow BMPs instead of, or in addition to,
numeric limits where calculations of numeric limits are not feasible.
These requirements may be all or some of the following:
A. Specific notice to IUs of requirements and enforceability shall be
included in control documents.
B. Installation of treatment and equipment shall be outlined and
include criteria for specifications that the equipment must satisfy.
C. Requirements for or prohibitions on certain practices, activities, or
discharges shall be incorporated in control documents as deemed
protective.
D. Requirements for operation and maintenance (O&M) of treatment
units shall be incorporated in control documents, as deemed
appropriate, to ensure that treatment systems continue to perform
as designed and installed.
E. Time frames associated with key activities shall be provided when
required equipment must be installed fully operational and will be
included in control documents.
F. Specific procedures for compliance certification, reporting and
records retention will be included in control documents.
G. Provision for reopening or revoking the BMP conditions will be
included in control documents if the Borough determines that it is
easier to establish compliance with numeric values or when the
user has failed to achieve compliance.
9. Slug loads and spills. Each industrial user shall provide protection from
spills or accidental discharges that result in unauthorized discharges or
slug load discharges. Facilities to prevent spills and slug loads shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's own sole
cost and expense.
A. Notification. In the case of a spill or slug load or any changes in
conditions affecting the potential for slug discharges or any other
unauthorized discharge, it is the responsibility of all industrial
§ 406 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 406
1:347
users to immediately telephone and notify the Borough of the
incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, corrective actions being taken
or planned, and expected duration.
B. Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising
employees whom to call in the event of a slug, spill or other
unauthorized discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees
who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
C. Written Notice. Within five days following a spill, slug load, or other
unauthorized discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the
Township a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewer
system, fishkills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this Part 4 or
applicable law. This notice requirement may be waived by the
Township for an industrial user which is not required to submit a
plan under Subsection 9D below.
D. SPCC Plans.
(1) All significant industrial users existing at the time of
enactment of this Part 4 shall complete and submit for approval
a spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC) plan, or
provide acceptable evidence that such a plan is not necessary
for their facility, within one year of an industry being identified
as significant in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vi).
(2) No significant industrial user who commences discharge to the
sewer system after the effective date of this Part 4 shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the sewer system until it
has completed and submitted for approval an SPCC plan or
provided acceptable evidence that such a plan is not necessary
for its facility. The Township, at its discretion, may require an
SPCC plan for any other industrial user, whether or not it
discharges process wastewater into the sewer system.
(3) SPCC plans for significant industrial users shall, at a minimum,
contain the elements specified in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii)(B)(6)
and 403.8(f)(2)(vi). SPCC plans shall be submitted to the
Township for review by the Township to determine if a plan is
needed before approval or implementation of the plan or
construction of any required facilities. Review and approval of
such plans, facilities and operating procedures by the
§ 406 LOGAN CODE § 406
1:348
Township and/or Borough shall not relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of the industrial pretreatment program,
nor shall such review and approval be deemed to constitute
any assurance or warrant on the part of the Township as to
the effectiveness or safety of the SPCC plan. An industrial user
will be inspected and reevaluated at least annually for the
need and effectiveness of its current SPCC plan. The Township
reserves the right to review and require revision to the current
SPCC plan, and facility, as deemed necessary to fulfill the
requirements specified above.
(4) At any time an IU has changes that have occurred, or are
planned for the future, at its facility, affecting the potential for
a slug discharge, the IU must notify the Township immediately
upon becoming aware of any such changes in accordance with
40 CFR 403.9(f)(2)(vi). A reevaluation will be conducted to
determine if an SPCC plan must be completed and approved or
updated. If an IU has been issued an industrial waste permit,
requirements for documentation or notification regarding slug/
spill control will be included in the permit.
10. Garbage Grinders. The discharge of garbage to the sewer system is
expressly prohibited unless said garbage is properly shredded to
comply with the provisions of this Part.
11. Trucked and Hauled Wastes. Discharge of trucked or hauled wastes into
the sewage collection system within the Township is prohibited.
12. Grease and Sand Traps. Grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps shall
be provided by a user when the Township determines that such devices
are necessary for the proper handling of wastewaters containing
greases, oils or settleable solids. Interceptors and traps shall be
installed, operated, maintained and cleaned properly, so that they will
consistently remove the grease, oil or settleable solids. Interceptors
and traps shall be properly designed to accommodate the maximum
flow rate expected to occur and shall be located as to be readily and
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
13. Notification Requirements - Hazardous Wastes and Hazardous
Substances.
A. All industrial users shall notify the Township, the Borough, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, Bureau of
Waste Management, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification shall include the
name of the hazardous waste, as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more
§ 406 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 406
1:349
§ 407. Fees. [Ord. 09-25-14]
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month, the
notification shall also include the following information, to the
extent that it is known and readily available to the industrial user:
(1) An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
waste;
(2) An estimation of the mass and concentration in the wastewater
of all such constituents discharged in the most recent month;
and
(3) An estimate of the mass and concentration of such constituents
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
B. Industrial users that commence discharge of a hazardous waste
after the effective date of this Part 4 shall submit the report within
180 days of first discharge of the hazardous waste, except as
provided in Subsection 13D of this section. If the new discharge
constitutes a change in the character of the industrial waste, the
industrial user shall also comply with the requirements of § 408,
Subsection 20, of this Part 4. In the case of any new regulations
under 40 CFR Part 261 identifying additional wastes as
characteristic or listed hazardous waste, the industrial user
discharging such substances shall submit the report within 90 days
of the effective date of the new regulations.
C. The required report need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. Industrial users regulated under
categorical standards which have already reported such
substances in baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance
reports or periodic compliance reports do not have to report this
information again.
D. Industrial users that discharge less than 15 kilograms of hazardous
wastes in a calendar month do not have to comply with these
reporting requirements. This exemption does not apply to acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
E. Each notification required by this section shall include a statement
certifying that the industrial user has a program in place to reduce
the volume and/or toxicity of the discharged wastes to the extent
that it is economically practical. This statement shall be signed by
the authorized representative of the industrial user.
1. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of
costs from industrial users of the sewer system for the implementation
of the industrial pretreatment program established herein. When the
Borough implements, administers or enforces the industrial
pretreatment program, the Borough may establish and assess such fees
for users within the Township.

1. Requirement for Wastewater Discharge Permits.
A. Discharge of any industrial waste to the sewer system without a
wastewater discharge permit, except as authorized by the
Township in accordance with the provisions of this Part 4, is an
unauthorized discharge and subject to the penalties provided
herein.
B. The Township reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to deny the
issuance of a wastewater discharge permit or to issue such a
permit conditionally. Such discretion may also be exercised by the
Township and its agent when administering the industrial
pretreatment program as provided in §§ 412 through 417 of this
Part 4.
2. Significant Industrial Users.
A. All significant industrial users proposing to connect to or to
discharge to the sewer system shall obtain a wastewater discharge
permit before connecting to or Discharging to the sewer system.
B. All significant industrial users that are connected to or discharging
to the sewer system at the time of enactment of this Part 4 shall
apply for and obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit,
§ 407 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:351
identified as significant under 40 CFR Section 403(V), within 90
days of the effective date of this Part 4 except as follows:
(1) At the discretion of the Township, this control may include use
of general wastewater discharge permits.
(2) The user must file a written request for coverage that identifies
its contact information, production processes (if applicable),
the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all
wastes covered by the general wastewater discharge permit,
and any other information the Township and/or Borough deems
appropriate.
(3) In accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) and 403.15, an industry is
not eligible to be issued a general wastewater discharge
permit if any of the following apply:
(a) If the facility is subject to production-based categorical
pretreatment standards.
(b) If the categorical pretreatment standards are expressed as
mass of pollutant discharged per day.
(c) If the industrial user has limits that are based on the
combined waste stream formula or net/gross calculations.
2.1. No Pollutant Present.
A. The authorization of a "no pollutant present" waiver is on a case-bycase
basis, is in the sole discretion of the Borough, and is subject to
the following conditions:
(1) The pollutant shall be present solely due to sanitary
wastewater discharged from the facility, provided that the
sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process
wastewater.
(2) The waiver is valid only for the duration of the wastewater
discharge permit.
(3) The industrial user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for any subsequent
wastewater discharge permits. This waiver must be signed by
an authorized representative of the facility and include the
certification statement included in the facility's permit
renewal.
(4) The industrial user must provide data from at least one
sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any
treatment present at the facility that is representative of all
wastewater from all processes.
§ 408 LOGAN CODE § 408
1:352
(5) Nondetectible sample results may only be used as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if a certified
laboratory performed the analysis and if EPA approved
methods from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum
detection level for that pollutant were used in the analysis.
(6) A grant for the monitoring of a pollutant shall be incorporated
into the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit.
(7) An industrial user shall certify on each sampling or compliance
report that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
waste stream due to activities of the industrial user. This
certification of "no pollutant present" shall be provided with
the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit.
(8) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present based on changes that occur in the IU's
operations, the IU must immediately comply with monitoring
requirements outlined in the current wastewater discharge
permit or more-frequent monitoring as determined by the
Township and/or the Borough.
(9) If an industrial user makes changes to processes, flow,
wastewater concentration, wastewater characteristics, or
other changes which result in the industrial user meeting the
definition of "significant industrial user," the industrial user
shall immediately upon becoming aware that such a change
has occurred, or 90 days prior to such a change if it is planned
by the industrial user, notify the Township and the Borough,
and the industrial user will be considered an SIU, and the "no
pollutant present" waiver will no longer be in effect. At that
time, the IU will be required to comply with the monitoring
requirements outlined in the IU's current wastewater
discharge permit.
B. The Township and/or the Borough may reduce the required
sampling events to one per year, unless required more frequently in
the pretreatment standard, if the IU meets all of the following
conditions:
(1) The IU's categorical wastewater follow does not exceed 0.01%
of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant
regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard
for which approved local limits were developed by the POTW in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.5(c) of the general pretreatment
requirements. In addition, this flow cannot exceed 0.01% of the
dry-weather hydraulic or organic treatment capacity of the
POTW; provided, however, that if the IU is considered an SIU
as defined in Subsection 3B of this § 408, than reduced
sampling shall not apply.
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:353
(2) The IU has not been in significant noncompliance, as defined in
§ 409, Subsection 11, of this Part, for the past two years.
(3) The IU does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or
pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the
reporting and sampling requirements will result in data that is
not representative of wastewater flows or conditions.
(4) The Borough must retain documentation to support the
determination that a specific industrial user qualifies for
reduced reporting requirements under subsection 2.1 of § 408
of this Part.
3. Other industrial users.
A. Except as otherwise required by the Township or Borough on a
case-by-case basis, industrial users which are nonsignificant
industrial users do not require a wastewater discharge permit but
are required to comply with all other provisions of this Part 4.
B. If an industrial user makes changes to processes, flow, wastewater
concentration, wastewater characteristics, or other changes which
result in the industrial user meeting the definition of "significant
industrial user," the industrial user shall immediately upon
becoming aware that such a change has occurred, or 90 days prior
to such a change if it is planned by the industrial user, notify the
Township and apply for a wastewater discharge permit.
C. The Township, at its discretion, may modify the time frame for
submission of a permit application and may require any
nonsignificant industrial users to apply for and obtain a wastewater
discharge permit, as the Township deems appropriate.
4. Signatory Requirements. When an application for a wastewater
discharge permit, any required report, an appeal, or any other
document as required by this Part 4 or pretreatment requirements is
submitted by an industrial user, such document shall be submitted to
the Township and/or Borough prior to or together with any report being
submitted and signed by an authorized representative of the industrial
user, as defined in this Part 4. If an authorization under Subsection D of
the definition of "authorized representation" is no longer accurate
because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for the
environmental matters for the company, then:
A. A new authorization satisfying the requirements of Subsection D of
the definition of "authorized representative" must be submitted to
the Township prior to or together with any documents to be signed
by an authorized representative; or
§ 408 LOGAN CODE § 408
1:354
B. The authorized representative, as defined in Subsection A, B or C of
the definition of "authorized representative," must sign any such
documents.

(18) Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Township to
ensure compliance with this Part 4 or any other applicable
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:359
ordinance and applicable federal, state and local pretreatment
requirements.
B. A wastewater discharge permit, or general control mechanism, in
addition to implementing requirements as mandated by federal
pretreatment regulations, may be a means for the Township to
implement other requirements in accordance with federal, state
and local law. Implementation and enforcement of such provisions
shall be at the discretion of the Township or the Borough acting as
the Township's agent as provided in § 412.
8. Transferability of Permits. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to
a specific industrial user for a specific operation. A wastewater

identified in § 406 are modified or other just cause exists, including
but not limited to the following:
(1) Violation by the permittee of any term or condition of the
wastewater discharge permit and/or any requirement set forth
in an applicable pretreatment law, ordinance, regulation or
rule by the permittee;
(2) A wastewater discharge permit was obtained by
misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts
in either a permit application, application for renewal, or any
report, including the falsification of self-monitoring reports or
the tampering with monitoring equipment;
§ 408 LOGAN CODE § 408
1:360
(3) Promulgation of more-stringent standards under federal, state
or local law, including the adoption of new or revised

A. If the industrial user has applied for renewal as provided for in
Subsection 9 of this § 408, and the wastewater discharge permit is
not renewed on or before the expiration date through no fault of the
industrial user, then the existing wastewater discharge permit shall
remain in effect pending a decision on the application for a reissued
permit by the Township.
B. If the wastewater discharge permit is not renewed because of a
failure of the industrial user to apply for renewal in a timely fashion
or through an act or omission of the industrial user, then discharge
of industrial waste by the industrial user without a wastewater
discharge permit is an unauthorized discharge and may be subject
to the enforcement actions provided for herein.
11. Appeal of Wastewater Discharge Permits.
A. Any industrial user that is issued or reissued a wastewater
discharge permit may appeal the permit conditions, in whole or in
part. If a wastewater discharge permit is modified during its
effective term, the industrial user may appeal only the conditions
which have been changed. Appeal procedures applicable to these
permit actions, as well as suspension or revocation of a wastewater
discharge permit, shall be as set forth in § 409, Subsection 7, of this
Part 4.
B. During the process of appeal, the wastewater discharge permit
shall remain in effect and shall be subject to potential enforcement
unless, upon the request of the permittee, the Township or Borough
grants a stay of permit condition(s). Pursuant to § 409, Subsection
7, conditions imposed by federal or state regulations (e.g.,
categorical standards) shall not be appealed or stayed. Conditions
which, in the opinion of the Township, would constitute a hazard or
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:361
pose a potential threat of pollution if stayed shall not be stayed
during an appeal.
C. The denial of issuance of a wastewater discharge permit may be
appealed under the procedures set forth in Subsection 7, of this
Part 4.
12. Baseline Monitoring Reports.
A. Where an industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated
categorical standard (i.e., an existing source), has not previously
submitted an application for a wastewater discharge permit as
required by § 408, Subsection 5, of this Part 4, the industrial user
shall, within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable
categorical standard:
(1) Apply for a wastewater discharge permit;
(2) Provide the baseline monitoring information required by 40
CFR 403.12(b) (this information may be incorporated into the
application for a wastewater discharge permit); and
(3) Provide a compliance schedule for meeting the pretreatment
standards as required by 40 CFR 403.12(c) if such a schedule
is required. The requirements of such a compliance schedule
are described in § 408, Subsection 5A(12) of this Part 4.
B. An industrial user with an existing wastewater discharge permit
shall submit to the Township within 180 days after the
promulgation of an applicable categorical standard the information
required by 40 CFR 403.12(b).
C. A new source or industrial user that becomes a categorical
industrial user through a change in facilities or processes shall
submit a report containing the information required by 40 CFR
403.12(b) at least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge
from the regulated process or facility. This information may be
incorporated into the application for a wastewater discharge
permit submitted in such time frame.
D. Baseline monitoring reports and all required industrial user reports
shall be signed and certified by an authorized representative in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(1) and 403.6(a)(2)(ii).
13. Categorical Compliance Report. Within 90 days following the date for
final compliance with applicable categorical standards or, in the case of
a new source, following commencement of the discharge of industrial
waste from processes regulated by categorical standards into the sewer
system, any industrial user subject to categorical standards shall
submit to the Township a report in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(d),
including information indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are
§ 408 LOGAN CODE § 408
1:362
limited by categorical standards and the average and maximum daily
flow for those process units in the industrial user's facility which are
limited by such categorical standards. The report shall certify that the
information contained therein concerning wastewater constituents and
flows is representative of discharges during normal work cycles. The
report shall also state whether the applicable categorical standards are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation
and management practices and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring
the industrial user into compliance with the applicable categorical
standards, and including a schedule for completion of the required
actions in the form described in § 408, Subsection 5A(12), of this Part
4. Such a schedule shall not have a compliance date later than that
established for the applicable categorical standard. This statement
shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.120 and 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and certified to by
a certified professional.
14. Periodic Compliance Reports.
A. All industrial users (categorical and significant noncategorical)
shall report to the Township at least twice a year, the date of the
report to be as determined by the Township and contained in the
wastewater discharge permit. Reports may be required more
frequently as deemed necessary by the Township.
B. The reports required under this section shall contain the
information required by 40 CFR 403.12(b) and/or (d) and/or (e)
and/or (g) and/or 403.12(h), as applicable, including, at a minimum,
data that is representative of conditions during the reporting
period, the measured concentrations of all pollutants regulated by
categorical standards or otherwise regulated by the wastewater
discharge permit, a record of any measured daily flows, and a
statement of accuracy and completeness signed and certified by
the authorized representative of the industrial user in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.12(1) and 403.6(a)(2)(ii). Reports shall also
contain any other information as required by the Township.
C. For significant industrial users subject to categorical standards, if
discharge limits are based on mass units per production unit, then
production information regarding the regulated processes during
the reporting period shall be included in the report, along with flow
and concentration values, so that a determination of compliance or
noncompliance with categorical standards can be made.
D. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance
with a best management practice (or pollution prevention
alternative), the IU shall submit documentation required by the
Township or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the
compliance status of the IU.
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:363
E. For significant industrial users subject to categorical standards, the
report shall contain certification of compliance with those
standards, signed by a certified professional.
F. Nonsignificant categorical industrial users, determined by the
Township pursuant to 40 CFR 403.3(v)(2), shall annually submit a
certification statement. This statement is to be signed in
accordance with the signatory requirements in 40 CFR 403.12(1)
and shall be included in the IU's wastewater discharge permit. This
certification must accompany an alternative report required by the
Township.
15. Reporting and Resampling of Discharge Limit Violations.
A. If, upon receipt of valid sampling and testing results, an industrial
user becomes aware that a violation of discharge limits has
occurred, the industrial user shall, within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the violation, notify the Township of this fact. Except as
otherwise approved by the Township and provided by 40 CFR
403.12(g)(2)(i) and (ii), the industrial user shall also resample and
analyze its discharge(s) for each parameter found to be in violation
and report the results of the resampling and analysis to the
Township within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation.
B. If the Township and/or Borough has performed the initial sampling,
the industrial user may be required, if notified by the Township
and/or Borough, to resample and follow the procedures set forth in
Subsection 14A of this § 408; otherwise the repeat sampling shall
be performed by the Township as required by 40 CFR 403.12(g)(2).
C. Each significant industrial user shall have a duty, on receipt of
validly obtained sampling and analysis results, of inspecting the
results and determining if any wastewater discharge permit
condition has been violated. Failure to examine and compare
testing results with wastewater discharge permit conditions shall
not be a valid defense for failure to comply with these reporting
conditions.
16. Sampling and Analysis.
A. Each industrial user, including SIUs and NSCIUs, shall perform
waste stream sampling and analyses, including frequency and
sample type, in accordance with its wastewater discharge permit or
as otherwise required by the Township.
B. All sampling and analysis performed by the industrial user,
including SIUs and NSCIUs, in compliance with wastewater
discharge permit conditions, to prepare the reports required in
Subsections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of this section, or as otherwise
required by the Township or Borough, shall be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis during the
reporting period. Sampling procedures and techniques are
§ 408 LOGAN CODE § 408
1:364
specified in 40 CFR Part 136, 40 CFR 403.12(g)(3) and (4), or
appropriate EPA guidance, including appropriate preservation
techniques. Unless otherwise required, all sampling should be
performed during a normal production day and should reflect the
usual and typical wastewater discharge of the user.
C. The industrial user, including SIUs and NSCIUs, may monitor more
frequently than otherwise required by the Township. If the
industrial user monitors any pollutant, subject to an effluent
limitation at the location designated for compliance monitoring,
more frequently than otherwise required by the Township, using
the procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 136 or as otherwise
required, the results of such monitoring shall be included in the
calculation and reporting of the data submitted to the Township.
D. Where the Township performs the sampling or collects the required
information herein, the Township may waive the corresponding
reporting requirement as provided in 40 CFR 403.12(g) and
403.12(h).
E. The industrial user shall ensure that all monitoring and analytical
equipment it uses to monitor or otherwise analyze the pollutants
discharged to the sewer system are periodically calibrated and
maintained at intervals which ensure the accuracy of
measurements.
F. If sampling results indicate that the industrial user has exceeded
an effluent limitation, the Township, as an enforcement response to
such violation, may require the industrial user to undertake
increased sampling. Upon notification from the Township, or as the
condition of a compliance schedule, the industrial user shall
undertake such additional monitoring as directed. In the event a
violation has occurred, and no IU self-monitoring is required, the
Township will resample if necessary.
17. Monitoring Facilities.
A. The Township may require an industrial user to provide and
operate, at the industrial user's own expense, monitoring facilities
to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the
wastewater or industrial waste discharge. The monitoring facility
should normally be situated on the industrial user's premises, but
the Township may, when such a location would be impractical or
cause undue hardship on the industrial user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
B. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at
the expense of the industrial user.
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:365
C. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
Township's requirements and all applicable local construction
standards and specifications.
D. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written
notification by the Township, unless the industrial user can show to
the Township's satisfaction that a longer time period is necessary.
18. Inspections. The Township and its duly authorized representatives,
including contractors, may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this Part 4 is being met and all requirements are
being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Township or its
representatives ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination
and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. Areas which
are subject to inspection include, but are not limited to, areas which
could result in wastewater discharge to the sewer, such as
manufacturing areas and chemical storage areas; pretreatment
facilities; spill prevention and control facilities; hazardous waste
generation areas; industrial self-monitoring facilities; and areas where
relevant documentation is kept or stored. The Township, the Borough
and the approval authority, and their agents, shall have the right to set
up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry onto its
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security
guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel
from the Township, Borough and approval authority will be permitted to
enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific
responsibilities. It shall not be inferred, however, that the Township is
authorized to enter upon property of any industrial user under this
section for any purpose in the event such entry is not otherwise
allowable under Pennsylvania law.
19. Pretreatment Facilities. Industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with this Part 4 and
shall achieve compliance with all applicable categorical standards
within the time limitations as specified by the applicable categorical
standards, and for other pretreatment requirements, shall achieve
compliance as specified by the state or Township, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities required for pretreatment shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the Township for review and shall be acceptable to
the Township before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial
user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
§ 408 LOGAN CODE § 408
1:366
produce a discharge which complies with the provisions of this Part
4. Any subsequent substantial changes in the pretreatment facilities
or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to
the Township prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes.
The review and acceptance of plans and procedures by the Township
shall not be considered as an approval regarding their efficacy, safety
or reliability; such considerations are solely the responsibility of the
industrial user.
20. Change in Operations.
A. Any industrial user contemplating or planning a substantial change
in the manufacturing process, raw materials, auxiliary processes,
pretreatment processes or other changes which may result in
substantial changes to wastewater character, composition, volume
or rate of flow shall notify the Township, in accordance with 40 CFR
403.12(j), in writing, at least 30 days prior to making such a change
or, if the change is not planned 30 days or more in advance,
immediately upon the decision to make such a change. If a change
in wastewater characteristics occurs without the knowledge of the
industrial user, the industrial user shall report the change
immediately upon becoming aware of it. The report shall include all
information necessary to determine the effect on the wastewater of
the change. The Township may require the industrial user to
undertake a compatibility study to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Township that the wastewater to be discharged is compatible
with the sewer system, will not affect any requirements imposed
upon the Township or Borough (including NPDES and sludge
disposal requirements) and will not otherwise adversely affect the
POTW.
B. The Township may, on receipt of such a report:
(1) Continue an existing wastewater discharge permit in effect;
(2) Require application for a new wastewater discharge permit;
(3) Modify an existing wastewater discharge permit to reflect the
changed nature of the waste;
(4) Rescind and reissue an existing wastewater discharge permit
in order to make substantial changes in wastewater discharge
permit conditions;
(5) Revoke an existing wastewater discharge permit or require the
industrial user to cease or prevent the discharge; or
(6) Take such other action as it deems appropriate.
21. Confidentiality.
A. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, wastewater discharge permit applications and
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:367
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the
public or any governmental agency without restriction unless the
industrial user specifically requests at the time of submission and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Township that the
release of such information, processes or methods of production
is entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics shall not be
recognized as confidential information.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a report, and supported
by evidence acceptable to the Township as to need for protection as
confidential material, the portion of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public but shall be made available to the
Township and, upon request, to governmental agencies for uses
related to this Part 4, the Authority's NPDES permit, any state
permit and/or the industrial pretreatment program; in addition,
such portions of a report shall be available for use by the EPA, the
state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
C. When information accepted by the Township as confidential is
transmitted to any government agency, a notification to the
industrial user may be provided listing the confidential information
transmitted and the governmental entity requesting it. The person
seeking confidentiality protection of the information shall bear the
burden of demonstrating to the other governmental agency that
such information is entitled to confidential protection.
22. Records.
A. All industrial users shall keep and maintain records of monitoring,
activities and results, wastewater discharge permits, waivers,
reports, and records of BMP compliance to the Township and the
Borough, in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(o)(1) and (2), for a
minimum of three years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance
with this Part or where the industrial user has been notified of a
longer retention period by the Township or Borough.
B. The industrial user shall furnish the Township, within a reasonable
time, any information which the Township may request to
determine whether cause exists for modifying, reissuing,
suspending or revoking a wastewater discharge permit or to
determine industrial user compliance. The industrial user shall also
furnish to the Township, upon request, copies of records required
to be kept. Where the industrial user becomes aware that it failed
to submit any relevant facts in an application for a wastewater
discharge permit, or submitted incorrect information in an
application for a wastewater discharge permit, report to the
Township or in any other correspondence pertaining to its
§ 408 LOGAN CODE § 408
1:368
§ 409. Enforcement. [Ord. 09-25-14]
industrial wastewater discharge, it shall promptly submit such
facts or information.
1. Right to Refuse.
A. The Township reserves the right to refuse to accept wastewater, or
combinations of wastewater, which are discharged in violation of
the terms or conditions of the industrial pretreatment program or
any permit or written directions issued by the Township pursuant
to the conditions of the industrial pretreatment program. The
Township may take such steps as it deems necessary, as outlined in
this Part 4, to compel discontinuance of use of the sewer system or
to require pretreatment of industrial wastes in order to comply
with the provisions of this Part 4. The Township may exercise its
right of refusal by denial of issuance of a wastewater discharge
permit; in such a case, the discharge of industrial waste by the
industrial user in question is prohibited.
B. Discharge of any industrial waste to the sewer system by a
significant industrial user, or by any other user required to have a
permit under § 408, Subsection 3, without a wastewater discharge
permit is an unauthorized discharge, as provided in § 408,
Subsection 1, and may be subject to the penalties provided herein.
2. Show-Cause Hearing.
A. The Township may direct any industrial user who causes or allows
an unauthorized discharge to enter the sewer system, or who
violates any condition or requirement of the industrial
pretreatment program or its wastewater discharge permit, to show
cause before the Township why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. A written notice may be served on the
industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held
by the Township regarding the violation, the reasons why the action
is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
industrial user to show cause before the Township why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the
hearing may be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least 10 days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation if the
industrial user is a corporation.
B. The Township may itself conduct the hearing and take the
evidence, or may designate any of its members or any
representative, including the pretreatment coordinator or other
Borough official, to:
(1) Issue in the name of the Township notices of hearings
requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 409
1:369
production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such
hearings;
(2) Take the evidence; and
(3) Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with
recommendations to the Township for action thereon.
C. At any hearing held pursuant to this Part 4, testimony taken may be
under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any
party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefor.
D. After the Township has reviewed the evidence, it may, in writing,
direct the industrial user to take certain actions to correct the
unauthorized discharge or to achieve compliance.
(1) The actions which may be directed include, but are not limited
to:
(a) Installation of pretreatment facilities or equipment;
(b) Modification or additions to existing pretreatment
facilities or equipment;
(c) Initiation of management practices which are required to
alter the nature of the industrial waste being discharged;
(d) Development or implementation of SPCC plans or other
measures;
(e) Other measures found to be necessary to correct the
unauthorized discharge or other noncompliance.
(2) The direction may be in the form of a schedule for compliance,
setting dates by which certain actions shall be taken.
E. Failure of an industrial user to comply with written directions
issued pursuant to a hearing constitutes a violation of this Part 4.
F. As provided in § 412 of this Part 4, show-cause hearings may be
scheduled, held and adjudicated by the Borough, acting in the
name of the Township, and such actions as the Borough may take in
the conduct and conclusions of such a hearing shall constitute final
administrative action.
3. Revocation of Permit.
A. Any industrial user who violates the following conditions of this
Part 4, or applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to
having its wastewater discharge permit revoked:
§ 409 LOGAN CODE § 409
1:370
(1) Failure of an industrial user to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge in any
application for a wastewater discharge permit or in any reports
required by Subsection 12, 13, 14 or 15 of § 408;
(2) Failure of the industrial user to report significant changes in
operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics as
required in § 408, Subsection 20;
(3) Refusal of reasonable access to the industrial user's premises
for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
(4) Violation of conditions of the wastewater discharge permit.
B. Any industrial user notified of a revocation of its wastewater
discharge permit may be required to immediately stop or eliminate
the discharge (even if an appeal of the revocation notice is
pending). In the event of a failure of the industrial user to comply
voluntarily with the notice of revocation, the discharge shall be
considered an unauthorized discharge, and the Township may take
such steps as deemed necessary, which may include immediate
severance of the connection between the building sewer and the
sewage collection system, or discontinuance of water service, to
prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system or endangerment
to the environment or any property or person.
4. Suspension of Permit.
A. The Township may suspend the wastewater discharge permit when
such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Township, in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons or to the environment, causes or may
cause interference or pass through, or causes or may cause the
Township, Borough or Authority to violate any condition of an
NPDES permit or any other federal or state law, rule, regulation or
permit condition.
B. Any industrial user notified of a suspension of its wastewater
discharge permit may be required to immediately stop or eliminate
the discharge (even if an appeal of the suspension notice is
pending). In the event of a failure of the industrial user to comply
voluntarily with the notice of suspension, the discharge shall be
considered an unauthorized discharge, and the Township may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of
the connection between the building sewer and the sewage
collection system, or discontinuance of water service, to prevent or
minimize damage to the sewer system or endangerment to the
environment or any property or person.
C. If a wastewater discharge permit has been suspended as a result of
an unauthorized discharge, which discharge resulted in or
§ 409 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 409
1:371
contributed to damages to the sewer system or to any person or
property, the wastewater discharge permit shall not be reinstated
until such time as all such claims have been satisfied.
D. The Township may reinstate the wastewater discharge permit upon
submission of proof by the industrial user of the elimination of the
unauthorized discharge or correction of the noncompliance for
which the suspension was imposed.
5. Notice of Violation. Whenever the Township finds that any industrial
user has violated or is violating this Part 4, its wastewater discharge
permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained herein,
the Township may serve upon such industrial user a written notice
stating the nature of the violation and requiring a response within a
specified time. Responses required of industrial users may include, but
are not restricted to, actions, plans, compliance schedules, or written
explanations.
6. Administrative Orders. The Township may issue written directions as
described in Subsection 2D, of this section without a show-cause
hearing if the Township determines that such directions are necessary
to correct conditions or remedy continuing violations of this Part 4 or
any wastewater discharge permit or other requirements of the
industrial pretreatment program or the Township, Borough, federal or
state regulations. Failure of an industrial user to comply with written
directions requiring compliance with provisions under this Part 4,
National Categorical pretreatment Standards, or a duly authorized
wastewater discharge permit constitutes a violation of this Part 4.
7. Right of Appeal.
A. An industrial user may appeal the enforcement actions enumerated
above in Subsections 3 and 4 of this section, the denial of a
wastewater discharge permit, or conditions contained in a
wastewater discharge permit. An appeal is subject to the following
requirements:
(1) The appeal must be made in writing to the Township, or to the
Borough if the actions being appealed were taken by the
Borough acting as agent as provided under the provisions of
§ 412 of this Part 4.
(2) The appeal must be made within 30 calendar days from the
date of receipt of the wastewater discharge permit or notice of
denial, suspension, modification or revocation of a wastewater
discharge permit being appealed by the industrial user.
(3) The appeal must state the specific provision(s) of a wastewater
discharge permit or the specific directions or actions of the
Township or Borough which are being contested.
§ 409 LOGAN CODE § 409
1:372
(4) The appeal must state the reasons for the appeal of each
provision.
(5) The appeal may suggest alternate or revised provisions to
replace those appealed.
(6) An appeal of a wastewater discharge permit may include a
request to stay specific permit conditions pending the outcome
of the appeal. Any such request shall include all factual and
legal justification for such a request. Filing of a request shall
not stay any condition of a wastewater discharge permit. Such
a stay must be approved by the Township as provided
Subsection 7E below.
B. Provisions mandated by federal or state regulations (e.g.,
compliance with categorical standards) shall not be appealed.
Conditions which, in the opinion of the Township or Borough, would
constitute a hazard or pose a potential threat of pollution if stayed
shall not be stayed during an appeal.
C. An appeal shall be made to the Township or the Borough as
provided above and shall be reviewed by any designated
representative(s) of the Township or Borough as appropriate,
provided:
(1) The representative shall not be the pretreatment coordinator;
and
(2) The representative shall not be the responsible official.
D. The representative(s) reviewing the appeal shall report in writing
to the Township or Borough, as appropriate, the results of the
review. The report should contain, at a minimum:
(1) A summary of each item appealed, the appellant's reasons for
appeal, and the appellant's proposed remedies, if any.
(2) The finding of merit for each point, and the reason(s) for
finding.
(3) For each point found to be with merit, a proposed remedy, and
a finding that the proposed remedy is allowable under this Part
4 and all applicable federal, state and local rules, regulations
and laws.
E. The Township or Borough, as appropriate, or a board appointed by
the Township or Borough, may, upon its own initiative or in
response to a request by the permittee, review the appeal and the
report and, at one or more regular or special public meetings, take
any additional testimony offered by the appellant, reviewer,
pretreatment program coordinator, or other interested party.
§ 409 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 409
1:373
(1) The municipality conducting the hearing may, within a
reasonable time, decide to:
(a) Grant a stay of wastewater discharge permit conditions
pending a decision on the merits of a permit appeal;
(b) Grant the appeal or portions of the appeal, applying such
remedies as it deems proper; or
(c) Deny the appeal.
(2) The decision by the municipality conducting the hearing
constitutes final administrative action.
F. If the Township, the Borough, or any hearing board appointed by
the Township or Borough shall have as a member any person who
has a financial, legal or other proprietary interest in the industrial
user bringing the appeal, such person shall recuse himself from any
vote which shall determine the decision of the body in regard to the
appeal.
G. Action of the Township or Borough for which review had been
available (e.g., enactment of an ordinance or issuance,
modification, suspension or revocation of a wastewater discharge
permit) shall not be subject to administrative or judicial review in
any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement.
8. Civil Actions. If any person violates the provisions of the industrial
pretreatment program, including local, national or state pretreatment
requirements, categorical standards, or any wastewater discharge
permit or written directions issued by the Township, the Township may
commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the
Court of Common Pleas of Blair County or any other appropriate forum.
9. Injunctive Relief. If any person causes or permits an unauthorized
discharge to occur; otherwise violates the conditions imposed by this
Part 4 or any wastewater discharge permit or written directions issued
by the Township or the Borough, or any national or state pretreatment
requirement; or discharges wastewater or industrial waste which
otherwise presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment or which threatens to interfere with the operations of the
POTW, the Township may commence an action in the Court of Common
Pleas of Blair County, or any other appropriate forum, for injunctive
relief to stop the discharge or violation or to require compliance with
the applicable condition.
10. Enforcement Response Plan. The Township, responsible official and the
pretreatment coordinator may be guided by the enforcement response
plan when reviewing industrial user reports, inspection results and
other compliance information and when taking enforcement action or
recommending to the Township enforcement action in response to
noncompliance.
§ 409 LOGAN CODE § 409
1:374
11. Significant Violators.
A. The Township shall publish annually, in any local daily newspaper
of general circulation within the Borough of Hollidaysburg that
provides meaningful public notice, a list of significant industrial
users that were found to be in significant noncompliance during the
previous calendar year and any industrial user that caused passthrough,
interference, imminent endangerment, or adversely
affected the pretreatment program. Significant noncompliance
shall be determined using measures of rate, magnitude, and type of
noncompliance, as delineated below:
(1) Chronic violations of numeric local limits [40 CFR
403.8(f)(2)(viii)(A)(B) and (C)], prohibitive discharge
standards, categorical standards and requirements, or other
numerical limitations on discharges of industrial waste. A
chronic violation occurs if the violation occurs in 66% or more
of all measurements taken during a six-month period (by any
magnitude) of a numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined in 40
CFR 403.3(1).
(2) Technical review criteria (TRC) violations of numeric local
limits, prohibitive discharge standards, categorical standards
and requirements, or other numerical limitations on
discharges of industrial waste. A TRC violation occurs if 33% or
more of all of the measurements for the same pollutant
parameter in a six-month period equal or exceed the product of
the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits, and the applicable TRC. For conventional
pollutants (BOD, total suspended solids and fats, oil and
grease), the TRC equals 1.4; for all other pollutants except pH,
the TRC equals 1.2.
(3) Any other violation of pretreatment local limits, prohibitive
discharge standards, or requirements as defined by 40 CFR
403.3(1) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative standard), discharges of industrial waste
which the Township or Borough determines has caused, alone
or in combination with other discharges, pass-through or
interference, or has endangered the health or safety of
Township, Borough or POTW personnel or the public.
(4) Any discharge that has caused imminent endangerment to
human health, welfare or the environment, or has caused the
Township or Borough to exercise its emergency authority
under Subsection 1, 3 or 4 of this § 409.
(5) Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater
discharge permit or submitted in response to written
§ 409 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 409
1:375
directions of the Township or Borough, for starting
construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance.
(6) Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, any
required reports, including but not limited to baseline
monitoring reports, periodic compliance reports, reports on
compliance with compliance schedules, or reports on a change
in operations.
(7) Failure to accurately report any noncompliance.
(8) Any other violation, noncompliance, which may include a
violation of best management practices, or group of violations
or noncompliances which the Township determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the
industrial pretreatment program.
B. The Township, subject to its discretion, may, as an enforcement
response, publish notification of industrial user noncompliance on a
more-frequent basis than annually or if the level of industrial user
noncompliance does not meet the significant noncompliance
standard.
12. Responsible Officials. Except as may be otherwise provided herein, the
responsible official, or other such official as duly appointed by the
Borough, shall administer and enforce the provisions of this Part 4. The
responsible official, or other duly appointed responsible official, may
delegate any or all powers granted by this Part 4 to the pretreatment
coordinator or to others as he deems appropriate. In the case that the
Township sees fit to unilaterally administer or enforce the provisions of
this Part 4, the Manager of the Township, or his/her duly appointed
agent, shall be responsible for such actions.

Penalties.
§ 410. Penalties. [Ord. 09-25-14]
1. Any person who violates any provisions of this Part 4, or the rules,
regulations and permits issued hereunder, may be subject to a civil
monetary penalty pursuant to applicable law. Each day on which a
violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and
distinct offense. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the
Borough and the Township may recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
court costs, court reporters' fees and other expenses of litigation by
appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this
Part 4 or the orders, rules, regulations, and permits issued hereunder.
Except for a violation which has been subject to a civil or criminal
penalty by the Township, nothing shall be deemed to preclude the
Township from commencing an action for a penalty of $25,000 per day
for each violation pursuant to 35 Pa. C.S.A. § 752.1 et seq, (also known
as the "Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty Law"), subject to the
appeal procedures as specified in 2 Pa. C.S.A.
2. In addition to any applicable civil or criminal penalty, the user is liable
for:
A. All damage which its discharge causes to the sewer system or
POTW if that damage is caused, in whole or in part, by the
industrial user's noncompliance with its wastewater discharge
permit or any applicable law, ordinance, regulation, rule or
pretreatment requirement; and
B. Any penalty imposed upon the Township or Borough (whether by
judicial or administrative order or the settlement of a judicial or
administrative penalty action) where the violation of the Township
was caused or increased by the industrial user, either alone or in
conjunction with discharge(s) from other source(s).

ARTICLE E.
Remedies Not Exclusive.
§ 411. Remedies Not Exclusive. [Ord. 09-25-14]
The enumeration of remedies in §§ 409 and 410 of this Part 4 does not
restrict their application and shall not be deemed to preclude any other
Township remedies, enforcement responses or other causes of action,
including those available under common law. Nothing in this Part 4, the
enforcement response plan or any other provision of the Township's
pretreatment program shall be intended to limit the enforcement discretion
of the Township to enforce pretreatment requirements as otherwise
provided for by law.
§ 411 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 411
1:379

ARTICLE F.
Administration of the Industrial Pretreatment Program.
§ 412. Appointment of Borough as Agent. [Ord. 09-25-14]
The Township appoints the Borough of Hollidaysburg as its agent for the
purposes of administering the industrial pretreatment program. All reports
and applications required by this Part 4 to be submitted to the Township
shall, unless otherwise directed by the Township, be submitted instead to
the Borough. The Borough is hereby authorized to develop all procedures
for inspecting users, reporting, issuing wastewater discharge permits,
reviewing pretreatment facility plans, and otherwise administering all of
the provisions of this Part 4 and the industrial pretreatment program. Local
limits developed by the Borough shall be applied as local limits authorized
by this Part 4 and applied to such industrial users as authorized by this Part
4. All administrative enforcement actions, as set forth in § 409 of this Part
4, may be taken by the Borough, acting as an agent of the Township; this
includes, but is not limited to, issuance of written directions and notices
of violation, the scheduling and hearing of show-cause hearings, and the
suspension or revocation of wastewater discharge permits. On the appeal
of an action by the Borough by an industrial user, the Borough will hear
the appeal and make final administrative decisions, unless the Township
exercises its right under this Part 4 to conduct the hearing of the appeal
and the right to make final decisions. This appointment may be revoked
only upon the amendment of this Part 4 by majority vote of the Board of
Supervisors of the Township of Logan, at a duly scheduled and publicly

§ 413. Authorization of Borough to Act in the Name of the
Township. [Ord. 09-25-14]
All enforcement procedures authorized by § 409 of this Part 4 may be
undertaken, without prior consultation with the Township, by the Borough,
and the Borough shall in such instances be authorized to act for and in
the name of the Township. It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors
of the Township of Logan that the industrial pretreatment program be
administered and enforced by the Borough and that all actions taken by the
Borough in administering and enforcing this Part 4 are actions on behalf
of the Township and may be taken in the name of the Township. This
authorization may be revoked only upon the amendment or revocation of
this Part 4 by a majority vote of the Board of Supervisors of the Township of
Logan at a duly scheduled and publicly advertised regular or special public
meeting.
§ 414. Information to be Shared with Borough. [Ord. 09-25-14]
Information acquired by the Township which pertains to the provisions of

§ 412 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 414
1:381
§ 415. Actions to be Taken in Support of Borough in Administration
and Enforcement. [Ord. 09-25-14]
The Township may provide such services as may be required or requested in
aid of the administration or enforcement of the provisions of the industrial
pretreatment program. Such aid and assistance may include, but not be
limited to, assistance in obtaining information, recordkeeping, sampling,
inspections or enforcement.
§ 416. Authorization of Borough not Exclusive. [Ord. 09-25-14]
Notwithstanding the above, the Township retains the right to administer
and enforce the industrial pretreatment program in keeping with the
provisions of this Part 4. When so notified by the Township, users shall
provide such information as is required by this Part 4 or its provisions to
the Township. The Township may take such administrative or enforcement
actions as it deems necessary to comply with the provisions of this Part 4.
§ 417. Special Agreements and/or Waiver of Pretreatment
Requirements. [Ord. 09-25-14]
Nothing contained in this Part 4 shall be construed as prohibiting special
agreements between the Township or Borough and a person discharging
industrial wastes or wastewaters to the sewer system, or for the Township
or Borough to otherwise waive requirements hereunder, when conditions
and circumstances making such special agreements or waiver advisable
and/or necessary, in the opinion of the Township or Borough, are present;
provided, however, that:
A. Information regarding new industrial users or changes in use of
existing users.
B. Information pertaining to the quality, quantity, or rate of flow of
discharges.
C. Information regarding violations of this Part 4 or any of its provisions or
of the industrial pretreatment program.
A. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and prohibitive discharge
standards [including the general and specific prohibitions set forth at
40 CFR 403.5(a) and (b)] shall not be waived, unless such waiver is
granted by mechanisms established under the federal pretreatment
regulations (40 CFR 403 et seq); and
B. In no case shall a special agreement or waiver of local limits allow for
an industrial user to discharge any pollutant which, alone or in
combination with other regulated industrial user discharges, would
reasonably be expected to exceed the mass loadings determined by the
Township as acceptable to the sewage treatment plant based upon
considerations of, among other things, interference, pass-through and
sludge contamination. The Township may consider other factors, e.g.,
§ 414 LOGAN CODE § 417
1:382
effect of the discharge on the POTW, future expansion, etc., as it deems
appropriate. In no event shall any special agreement or waiver allow
the sum of the loadings allocated to industrial loadings to exceed the
values set forth in any local limits analysis submitted by the Township
or Borough to the EPA and approved by the EPA as part of the industrial
pretreatment program.
C. The Township may require an industrial user requesting a special
agreement or waiver adjusting effluent limitations to submit supporting
documentation indicating why the industrial user cannot reasonably
expect to meet the effluent limitation contained in its wastewater
discharge permit or other pretreatment requirements, setting forth an
expeditious schedule for achieving compliance with such limitations,
and including such other information as the Township may require. In
granting any special agreement or waiver, the Township may impose
time limitations upon any reduced requirements and provide a
compliance schedule for achieving compliance. In granting any special
agreement or waiver, the Township may impose any other conditions
deemed necessary to implement the purposes of this Part 4.
D. If granting a special agreement or waiver would result in increased
costs to the Township or Borough (e.g., treatment, monitoring, sludge
disposal costs), the Township may condition the special agreement or
waiver upon the agreement of the industrial user to pay those costs and
to provide security adequate in the judgement of the Township to
assure payment of said costs.

Easterly and/or Westerly Wastewater Treatment Facility, if such
commercial or industrial user's discharge reasonably appears to
present an imminent danger to the health or welfare of persons, or the
environment; or if this discharge interferes or threatens to interfere
with the operation of the Easterly and/or Westerly Wastewater
Treatment Facility; or if violations of the industrial wastewater
contribution permit conditions as authorized by the Township
ordinances or resolutions or the AWA's Wastewater System Regulations
has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur. The AWA may seek
equitable relief against any commercial or industrial user of the
Township sewer system, which discharges into the Easterly and/or
Westerly Wastewater Treatment Facility if it believes that acts or
omissions by the commercial or industrial user have caused or have the
potential to cause harm to any part of the Township which discharges
into the Easterly and/or Westerly Wastewater Treatment Facility. Any
actions at law or in equity initiated by the AWA against a commercial or
industrial user in the Township, which discharges into the Easterly and/
or Westerly Wastewater Treatment Facility of the Township sewer
system in furtherance of the provisions of the ordinances or resolutions
shall not be contested or intervened by the Township, except in support
of the AWA.
4. The Township, if required by the AWA, shall act in concert with and in
support of the AWA in implementing, administering and enforcing the
provisions of the Township ordinances or resolutions. The Township
agrees that they shall not hinder, delay or obstruct the efforts of the

commercial or industrial users that have been disconnected or have
gone out of business, changes in ownership of existing commercial or
industrial users, or other similar information readily available to the
Township.
1. The Township recognizes its obligation to enforce its Township
ordinances and resolutions, and the Township hereby covenants that it
will enforce its ordinance or resolution. The Township also recognizes
that the AWA, as the author of the Industrial Pretreatment Program, has
knowledge regarding the intent and interpretation of the Wastewater
System Regulations which includes the Industrial Pretreatment
Program and requirements. In addition, the Township, intending to
ensure that all commercial and industrial users, which discharges into
the Easterly and/or Westerly Wastewater Treatment Facility, are treated
equitably, recognizes that guidance from the AWA may be necessary to
achieve such a goal. Therefore, the Township shall coordinate its
enforcement actions by means of the provisions of Subsection 4 of this
§ 503.

has hindered the proper operation, administration or enforcement of
the Industrial Pretreatment Program in the Altoona City Sewer District
of Logan Township and the portions of the Logan Township Sewer
District served by the AWA, and following notice by the AWA of such
hindrance, the Township fails to remedy the identified condition, the
AWA may invoke its authority to enforce the provisions of the Township
ordinance or resolutions as provided in Subsection 2 of § 502, and
thereafter enforce the Industrial Pretreatment Program in the Altoona
City Sewer District and the portions of the Logan Township Sewer
District served by the AWA, and all the provisions of this Part 5,
including the imposition of various penalties on commercial and
industrial users located within the Township, which discharges into the
Easterly and/or Westerly Wastewater Treatment Facility. Alternatively
or simultaneously, the AWA may develop a remedial plan, containing a
description of the nature of the problem, an enumeration of the
remedial steps to be taken by the Township, and a time schedule for
implementing each step. If the Township fails or refuses to satisfy the
terms of such a plan, the AWA may induce fines and/or institute a showcause
hearing as specified in the AWA Wastewater System Regulations.

Township, and the AWA is not authorized to enforce the Township
ordinances or resolutions in such instances, nor may it invoke its status
as an agent to enforce Township ordinances or resolutions against
persons not otherwise considered commercial or industrial users;
provided, however, that the AWA retains its legal rights to seek
appropriate equitable or judicial relief for grievances against all
persons as provided by law.
4. The AWA shall provide guidance and coordination to the Township so as
to ensure that the provisions of the Industrial Pretreatment Program
are enforced uniformly and equitably. The Township shall consult the
AWA in the enforcement of the Township ordinances or resolutions to
ensure that enforcement actions taken by one are consistent with the
other. The AWA shall make available upon request by the Township, for
examination and copying, all records and documents pertaining to the
enforcement of the Industrial Pretreatment Program in the Altoona City
Sewer District of Logan Township and those portions of the Logan
Township Sewer District served by the AWA. The Township shall advise
the AWA of all actions taken in the enforcement of the Township
ordinances or resolutions, and, upon request from the AWA shall
provide copies of all relevant documents in regard to enforcement of
such ordinances or resolutions.
1. In order to recover costs for sampling, analysis, surcharges, permit
application fees, and fines for enforcing the Industrial Pretreatment
Program, the AWA shall assess and collect fees of commercial and
industrial users located within the Township per the AWA's wastewater
charge system. Such fees are considered separate from the user fees
established by the Township and shall be billed directly to Logan
Township for those commercial and industrial users.
2. The AWA will maintain the wastewater charge system which lists a fee
schedule and provides for fees and surcharges for the acceptance and
treatment of wastewater containing amounts of compatible pollutants
in excess of those normally discharged by commercial and industrial
users to the Easterly and/or Westerly Wastewater Treatment Facilities.

Part 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 101. Short Title. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "Stormwater
Management."
§ 102. Statement of Findings. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
§ 103. Purpose. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
1. The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases
runoff volumes, flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and
storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry
and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and
flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and
increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities
causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health,
safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports the base
flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure and low-impact development (LID)
are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment
by using systems and practices which use or mimic natural
processes to: 1) infiltrate and recharge; 2) evapotranspire; and/or
3) harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green
infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the restoration or
maintenance of predevelopment hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities
are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program.
1. The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare
within the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and

Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the Township inconsistent
with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only.
maximizing the benefits described in § 102 of this chapter, through
provisions designed to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff
volumes and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the
municipality.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

§ 107. Severability. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 108. Compatibility with Other Requirements. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 109. Erroneous Permit. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality
purporting to validate such a violation.
§ 110. Waivers. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
§ 111. Liability Disclaimer. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
1. If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to § 110, Subsections 2 and 3.
2. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question,
provided that the modifications will not be contrary to the public
interest and that the purpose of the chapter is preserved. Cost or
financial burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modification may
be considered if an alternative standard or approach will provide equal
or better achievement of the purpose of the chapter. A request for
modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater
management site plan submission. The request shall provide the facts
on which the request is based, the provision(s) of the chapter involved
and the proposed modification.
3. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be
granted by the municipality unless that action is approved in advance
by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated
county conservation district.

thereunder, shall relieve any person from any responsibility for damage
to persons or property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by
law, nor impose any liability upon Township officials, employees or its
designated representatives to the maximum extent permitted by law.
2. Neither the granting nor the denial of any permit which includes any
stormwater management requirements shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the Township, the
Township officials, employees, or designated representatives thereof of
the practicability or safety of any stormwater structure or facility, use
or other plan proposed, and shall create no liability or cause of action
upon any Township official, employee, or designated representative

§ 301 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 303
1:475
§ 303. Volume Controls. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
1. The green infrastructure and low-impact development practices
provided in the BMP Manual29 shall be utilized for all regulated
activities wherever possible. Water volume controls shall be
implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the
Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated activity areas
equal or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic routing to
design the stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no preference
for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either
methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with
each methodology and other factors.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual)30 is
applicable to any size of regulated activity. This method requires
detailed modeling based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas
must be considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model
for existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual)31 provided below
is independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design
Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to
regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that
require design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious
surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
29.Editor's Note: See § 1001, Subsection 3, of this chapter.
30.Editor's Note: See § 1001, Subsection 3, of this chapter.
31.Editor's Note: See § 1001, Subsection 3, of this chapter.
§ 303 LOGAN CODE § 303
1:476
§ 304. Rate Controls. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 304, Rate
Controls.
1. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: Postdevelopment discharge rates shall
not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm
events. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
postdevelopment analysis are less than or equal to the peak-rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour
storms, then the requirements of this section have been met.
Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary
to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
2. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm events, the
postdevelopment peak discharge rates will follow the applicable
approved release rate maps. For any areas not shown on the release
rate maps, the postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates.
3. This criterion shall apply to the total activity even if the activity is to
take place in stages. More stringent criteria may be required in
sensitive areas where stormwater problems presently exist. These
requirements may be modified based on a detailed engineering study
completed by a licensed professional engineer of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, on behalf of the developer, which demonstrates that
modification of these requirements is justified, and such plan is
reviewed and recommended by the Logan Township Engineer for
approval by the Logan Township Board of Supervisors.
4. The stormwater plan for the development site shall consider all of the
stormwater runoff flowing over the site.
A. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development site are
not subject to this control standard when determining allowable
peak runoff rates; however, on-site drainage facilities shall be
designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development
site.
B. Where the site area to be impacted through a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area
§ 303 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 304
1:477
(less than 10%), only the proposed impact area shall be subject to
the runoff criteria.
5. Storm Frequencies. The USDA NRCS twenty-four-hour, Type II Rainfall
Distribution shall be used for analyzing stormwater runoff for both preand
postdevelopment conditions.
6. Calculation Methods:
A. Development Sites. For the purpose of computing peak flow rates
and runoff hydrographs from development sites, calculations shall
be performed using one of the following: USDA NRCS publications,
Technical Release (TR) 55 or 20, HEC I or Penn State Runoff Model
(PSRM) or Modified Rational Method. Under special circumstances
other computation methods may be used subject to the approval of
the Township Engineer.
B. Stormwater Collection/Conveyance Facilities. For the purposes of
designing storm sewers and other stormwater runoff collection and
conveyance facilities, Rational Method or other method as
approved by the Township Engineer may be applied. Rainfall
intensities for design shall be obtained from the PennDOT, Storm
Intensity-Duration-Frequency Charts, as amended to date.
C. Routing of hydrographs through detention/retention facilities for
the purpose of designing those facilities shall be accomplished
using the Modified-Pulls Method or other recognized reservoir
routing method subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
D. Predevelopment Conditions. Predevelopment conditions shall be
assumed to be those that exist on any site prior to commencing any
development activities. SCS runoff curve numbers selected for use
in the calculations shall accurately reflect existing conditions
subject to the approval of the Township Engineer. The hydroponic
conditions for all areas with pervious cover (i.e., fields, woods, lawn
areas, pastures, cropland, etc.) shall be assumed to be in "good"
condition and the lowest recommended SCS runoff curve number
(CN) shall be applied for all pervious land uses within the
respective range for each land use and hydroponic soil group.
Impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to, any roof,
parking, or driveway areas, and any new roadways and sidewalks.
Any areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be
assumed to be impervious for the purposes of these criteria. The
computed existing runoff rates shall be reconciled with field
observations and conditions. If the designer of the stormwater
management facilities can substantiate through actual physical
calibration that more appropriate runoff values should be used at a
particular development site, then appropriate variations may be
made upon review and approval of the Township Engineer.
Calibration shall require detailed gauge and rainfall data for the
particular development site in question.

1:478
§ 305. Riparian Buffers. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
1. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian buffer.
2. Except as required by Chapter 102,32 the riparian buffer easement shall
be measured to be the greater of the limit of the one-hundred-year
floodplain or a minimum of 35 feet from the top of the stream bank (on
each side).
3. Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.
A. Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
B. Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
4. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds
office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the
property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued
private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area as
required by Zoning, unless otherwise specified in Chapter 27, Zoning.
5. Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing onehundred-
year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
6. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian buffers:
A. Trails shall be for nonmotorized use only.
B. Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
7. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.

§ 405. Resubmission of Disapproved SWM site plans. [Ord.
09-14-17A]
A disapproved SWM site plan may be resubmitted, with the revisions
addressing the municipality's concerns, to the municipality in accordance
with this part. The applicable review fee must accompany a resubmission of
a disapproved SWM site plan.
5. For any SWM site plan that proposes to use any BMPs other than green
infrastructure and LID practices to achieve the volume and rate
controls required under this chapter, the municipality will not approve
the SWM site plan unless it determines that green infrastructure and
LID practices are not practicable.
6. If the municipality disapproves the SWM site plan, the municipality will
state the reasons for the disapproval in writing. The municipality also
may approve the SWM site plan with conditions and, if so, shall provide
the acceptable conditions for approval in writing.
7. Where the proposed development requires an obstruction permit from
the Pennsylvania DEP or an erosion/sedimentation permit from the
Blair County Conservation District, final stormwater plan approval shall
not be granted until receipt of such permits. No building permit shall be
issued, nor construction started, until such permits are received and
copies filed with the Township.
1. A modification to a submitted SWM site plan that involves a change in
SWM BMPs or techniques, or that involves the relocation or redesign of
SWM BMPs, or that is necessary because soil or other conditions are
not as stated on the SWM site plan as determined by the municipality
shall require a resubmission of the modified SWM site plan in
accordance with this part.
2. If the request for a plan modification is initiated after construction is
underway, the Township Engineer shall recommend approval or
disapproval of the modification based upon field inspection and review
of any design calculations and information requested by the Township
Engineer provided:
A. The requested changes in stormwater controls do not result in any
modifications to other approved Township land use/development
requirements (e.g., building setbacks, yards, buffer zones, etc.);
and
B. The performance standards set forth in this chapter are met.
Notification of the Township Engineer's action shall be sent to the
governing body which may issue a stay of the plan modification and
require the developer to resubmit the plan modification for full
stormwater plan review.

§ 406. Authorization to Construct and Term of Validity. [Ord.
09-14-17A]
1. Upon final stormwater plan approval, receipt of all necessary permits,
execution of any agreement with a developer and posting of the
necessary financial security, the developer may commence to install or
implement the approved stormwater plan.
2. The municipality's approval of an SWM site plan authorizes the
regulated activities contained in the SWM site plan for a maximum term
of validity of five years following the date of approval. The municipality
may specify a term of validity shorter than five years in the approval for
any specific SWM site plan. Terms of validity shall commence on the
date the municipality signs the approval for an SWM site plan. If an
approved SWM site plan is not completed according to § 407 within the
term of validity, then the municipality may consider the SWM site plan
disapproved and may revoke any and all permits. SWM site plans that
are considered disapproved by the municipality shall be resubmitted in
accordance with § 405 of this chapter.
3. If the site development or building construction does not begin within
two years of the date of final approval of the stormwater plan, then,
before doing so, the developer shall resubmit the stormwater plan to
verify that no condition has changed within the watershed that would
affect the feasibility or effectiveness of the previously approved
stormwater management controls. Further, if for any reason
development activities are suspended for two years of more, then the
same requirement for resubmission of the stormwater plan shall apply.
4. No work shall commence on any subsequent phase until the preceding
phase has been inspected and approved by the Township in accordance
with § 407. If there are deficiencies in any phase, the Township
Engineer shall issue a written description of the required corrections
and stipulate the time by which the corrections must be made.
5. If, during construction, the developer or the developer's contractor
identifies any site conditions, such as subsurface soil conditions,
alterations in surface or subsurface drainage which could affect the
feasibility of the approved stormwater management facilities, the
developer shall notify the Township Engineer within 24 hours of the
discovery of such condition and request a field inspection. The
Township Engineer shall determine if the condition requires a
stormwater plan modification.
6. The Township Engineer or a designated representative shall inspect the
construction of the temporary and permanent stormwater management
system for the development site. The developer shall notify the
Township Engineer at least 48 hours in advance of the completion of the
following key development phases:

7. In cases where stormwater control facilities are to be installed in areas
of landslide-prone soils or other special site conditions exist, the
Township Engineer, at its sole discretion, may require special
precautions such as soil tests and core borings, full-time inspectors
and/or similar measures. All costs of any such measures shall be borne
solely of the developer.
1. The developer shall be responsible for providing as-built plans of all
SWM BMPs included in the approved SWM site plan. The as-built plans
and an explanation of any discrepancies with the construction plans
shall be submitted to the municipality.
2. The as-built submission shall include a certification of completion
signed by a qualified professional verifying that all permanent SWM
BMPs have been constructed according to the approved plans and
specifications. The latitude and longitude coordinates for all permanent
SWM BMPs must also be submitted, at the central location of the BMPs.
If any licensed qualified professionals contributed to the construction
plans, then a licensed qualified professional must sign the completion
certificate.

Part 5
DESIGN CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CONTROLS
§ 501. General Criteria. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
§ 502. Criteria for Infiltration Systems. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
1. The developer may select runoff control techniques, or a combination of
techniques, which are most suitable to control runoff from the
development site. All controls shall be subject to the approval of the
Township Engineer. The Township Engineer may request specific
information on design and/or operating features of the proposed
stormwater management controls in order to determine their suitability
and adequacy in terms of the standards of this chapter.
2. The developer must consider the effect of the proposed stormwater
management techniques on any special soil conditions or geological
hazards that may exist on the development site. In the event such
conditions are identified on the site, the Township Engineer may
require in-depth studies by a competent geotechnical engineer. Not all
stormwater methods may be allowable at a particular development site.
3. In developing a stormwater plan for a particular site, stormwater
controls shall be selected according to the following order of
preference:
A. Infiltration of runoff on site, such as underground perforated pipe
with clean coarse aggregate backfill wrapped with geotextile
material.
B. Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions.
C. Construction of stormwater detention/retention structures.
4. Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to reduce
volume increases and promote groundwater recharge. A combination of
successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum
control requirements. The developer shall provide justification for
rejecting each of the preferred practices based upon actual site
conditions.
1. Infiltration systems shall be sized and designed based upon local soil
and groundwater conditions.
2. All infiltration systems shall be located at least 10 feet from basement
walls.
3. Infiltration systems shall not be used to handle runoff from commercial
or industrial working or parking areas. This prohibition does not extend
to roof areas that are demonstrated to be suitably protected from the
effects of the commercial/industrial activities.
§ 501 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 502
1:491
§ 503. Criteria for Flow Attenuation Facilities. [Ord. 09-14-17A]
§ 504. Criteria for Stormwater Detention/Retention Facilities. [Ord.
09-14-17A]
4. Infiltration systems may not receive runoff until the entire drainage
area tributary to the system has received final stabilization.
5. The stormwater infiltration facility design shall provide an overflow
system with measures to provide a nonerosive velocity of flow along its
length and at the outfall.
6. Roof drain infiltration facilities shall provide an effective volume of at
least one cubic foot for every two square feet of roof surface.
7. Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as to
maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
1. If flow attenuation facilities are employed to assist in the control of peak
flows of discharge, their effects must be quantified using SCS Technical
Release (TR) 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds or other
method approved by the Township Engineer. The effects of flow
attenuation facilities on travel time should be reflected in the
calculations.
2. Flow attenuation facilities such as swales and natural depressions
should be properly graded to ensure positive drainage and avoid
prolonged ponding of water.
3. Swales shall be properly vegetatively stabilized or otherwise lined to
prevent erosion.
4. Swales shall be designed according to the recommendations contained
in the latest edition of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Erosion and
Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.
1. If detention/retention facilities are utilized for the development site, the
facility(ies) shall be designed such that postdevelopment peak runoff
rates from the developed site are controlled to those rates defined by
this chapter.
2. Shared-storage facilities that provide detention of runoff for more than
one development within a single subarea are encouraged wherever
feasible and provided such facilities meet the criteria contained in this
chapter. In addition, runoff from the developments involved shall be
conveyed to the facility in a manner that avoids adverse impacts (such
as flooding or erosion) to channels and properties located between the
development and the shared-storage facility.
3. Where detention/retention facilities will be utilized, multiple use
facilities (such as wetlands, lakes, ballfields or similar recreational/
§ 502 LOGAN CODE § 504
1:492
open space uses) are encouraged wherever feasible, subject to the
approval of the Township Engineer and compliance with the
Pennsylvania DEP's Chapter 105 regulations.
4. Construction of the detention/retention facilities shall conform to the
construction specifications of the PennDOT, Publication 408
Specifications, latest edition, and RC Standards for Roadway
Construction, latest edition.
5. Design of the detention/retention facilities shall include the following:
A. Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and installed to
prevent erosion to the side slopes. Inflow and outflow structures,
pumping stations and other structures shall be designed to
minimize safety hazards.
B. Bottoms of stormwater detention/retention basins shall be graded
with sufficient slope to provide positive surface drainage. Bottoms
of storage facilities shall be protected from erosion. A subdrainage
system may be required depending upon the location of the pond
bottom relative to groundwater levels.
C. Stormwater detention/retention basins shall have an emergency
spillway. The emergency spillway shall have capacity to handle a
one-hundred-year storm with at least one foot of freeboard. The
Township may require more stringent criteria in sensitive areas
where stormwater problems presently exist. Erosion protection
shall be provided for the emergency spillway compatible with the
computed maximum discharge velocity. The minimum size of rock
lining shall be PennDOT Class R-4.
D. If the fill height for a stormwater detention/retention facility
exceeds five feet, a compaction study must be performed. Fill must
be place in compacted lifts. Where the fill height exceeds five feet,
compaction testing shall be performed during construction and the
developer shall provide the Township with documentation that the
fill was compacted to a density of at least 95% of the Standard
Proctor (ASTM Specification D698).
E. Side slopes inside of the stormwater detention/retention basins
shall not exceed a ratio of 2 1/2:1 horizontal to vertical dimension.
This requirement may be modified based on a detailed engineering
study completed by a licensed professional engineer of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the developer, which
demonstrates that modification of these requirements is justified,
and such plan is reviewed and recommended by the Logan
Township Engineer for approval by the Logan Township Board of
Supervisors.
F. Landscaping shall be provided for the stormwater detention/
retention facility that harmonizes with the surrounding area.
Vegetative cover shall be provided for all areas disturbed by the

slopes.
G. Control and removal of debris both in stormwater detention/
retention structure and in all inlet and outlet devices shall be a
design consideration.
H. Stormwater detention/retention facilities shall be located to
facilitate maintenance taking into consideration the frequency and
type of equipment that will be required.
I. The perimeter of all detention/retention facilities shall be
completely fenced with a fence having a minimum height of six feet.
Said fence shall be constructed of chain link or other similar
material as may be approved by the Township. A double gate
having a minimum width of 12 feet shall be installed in the fence to
provide access to the stormwater storage facilities. The developer
shall furnish a gate lock.
(1) Fencing may be waived if the proposed facility meets the
following three criteria:
(a) Maximum possible ponding depth of 12 inches or less;
(b) Maximum side slopes of the facility are three horizontal to
one vertical;
(c) Calculations are provided to demonstrate the facility will
dewater within 72 hours of a storm event.
J. To facilitate maintenance and inspection, all stormwater storage
facilities shall be provided with a stabilized access road of a type
subject to the approval of the Township Engineer. When located on
undedicated land, the access road shall be placed within an
easement not less than 20 feet wide, as approved by the Township
Engineer, who may require additional width of easement as
circumstances warrant.
K. Upon completion of the stormwater detention/retention facilities,
the developer shall provide to the Township a certification from an
engineer, licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
certifying that said facilities were constructed in accordance with
this chapter and the plans approved by the Township.
1. All stormwater runoff collection and conveyance facilities shall be
designed in accordance with the following basic standards.
A. Any property(ies) or watercourse(s) receiving stormwater from a
site shall contain an easement from the property owner(s) granting
permission to convey stormwater over the property or watercourse.
§ 504 LOGAN CODE § 505
1:494
The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent properties shall not be altered without a notarized
statement of approval from the adjacent property owner (or
downstream property owners if required by the Municipal
Engineer), accepting the revisions to the concentrated flow. All
such statements shall be recorded in the Blair County Recorder's
office. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent
properties shall be managed such that, at minimum, the peak
diffused flow does not increase in the general direction of
discharge, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. If diffused
flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent
property, the developer must document that there are adequate
downstream conveyance facilities to safely transport the
concentrated discharge or otherwise prove that no harm will result
from the concentrated discharge. Areas of existing diffused
drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable release rate
criteria in the general direction of existing discharge whether they
are proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused
drainage areas. The developer must submit to the Township a
statement, properly acknowledged and notarized, from the
adjacent property owner (or downstream property owners if
required by the Township Engineer), accepting the altered flow. All
such statements shall be recorded in the Blair County Recorder's
office at the sole cost of the person obtaining the same.
B. Where a development site is traversed by a natural watercourse,
there shall be provided a drainage easement or right-of-way
conforming substantially to the line of such natural watercourse
and of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural drainage.
The terms of the easement or right-of-way shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of
the easement or right-of-way. Also maintenance, including mowing
of vegetation within the easement or right-of-way shall be required,
except as approved by the appropriate governing authority. If
applicable, the developer shall obtain drainage easements or
rights-of-way from downstream property owners.
C. In order to promote overland flow and infiltration/percolation of
runoff, roof drains shall not be connected to roadways or storm
sewers unless permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Township.
Lots located on the high side of roadways shall extend footer drains
to the curbline storm sewer, if applicable. Low side lots shall extend
footer drains to a stormwater collection/conveyance/control system
or natural watercourse in accordance with the approved
stormwater plan for the development site. If applicable, stabilized
outlets shall be provided for all roof drains and footer drains.
§ 505 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 505
1:495
D. Collection/conveyance facilities shall not be installed parallel and
close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid the
possibility of failing or causing the embankment to fail.
E. All stormwater drainage collection/conveyance facilities shall be
designed to convey the twenty-five-year storm peak flow rate from
the contributing drainage area and to carry it to the nearest
suitable outlet such as a stormwater control facility, curbed
roadway, storm sewer or natural watercourse without damage to
the drainage structure or roadway. All stormwater drainage
collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey the
runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm. Roadway crossings
located within designated floodplain area must be able to convey
runoff from the one-hundred-year design storm with a minimum of
1.0 foot freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of
the roadway. Stormwater drainage collection/conveyance facilities
must also be designed to convey the one-hundred-year storm event
to any stormwater detention facilities so as not to endanger life or
seriously damage property.
F. Stormwater drainage shall not be permitted to cross over
intersections or the crown of the public street. Trench drains shall
be used to control drainage from entrances (driveways, business
accesses) to a public street.
G. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the development site cannot adequately provide
for drainage, open channels may be constructed conforming
substantially to the line and grade of such natural drainageways.
Work within natural drainageways shall be subject to the approval
of the DEP through its Joint Permit Application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by the DEP, through its General Permit
process.
H. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, to drain all low points
along roadways and to intercept stormwater runoff along roadways
at intervals reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area
drained.
I. Existing points of concentrated stormwater drainage that
discharge from the development site onto adjacent property shall
not be altered without the permission of the altered property
owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge criteria
specified in this chapter.
J. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to
any applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of the
existing discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or
maintained as diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise
provided by this chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to be
§ 505 LOGAN CODE § 505
1:496
concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the developer
must document that adequate downstream conveyance facilities
exist to safely transport the concentrated discharge, or otherwise
prove that no erosion, sedimentation, flooding, or other harm will
result from the concentrated discharge.
K. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter
that would be located in or adjacent to waters of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or wetlands shall be subject to
approval by the DEP through its Joint Permit Application process,
or, when deemed appropriate by the DEP, through its General
Permit process. When there is a question whether wetlands may be
involved, it shall be the responsibility of developer to show that the
land in question cannot be classified as wetlands, otherwise
approval to work in the area in question must be obtained from the
DEP.
L. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter
that would be located within the right-of-way of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania shall be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation.
M. All spring and sump pump discharges shall be collected so as not to
flow onto any roadway. Stabilized outlets shall be provided for all
spring and sump pump discharges.
2. Storm sewers shall comply with the following criteria.
A. Where practical, the storm sewers shall be designed to traverse
under seeded and planted areas. If constructed within 10 feet of
road paving, walks or other surfaced areas, storm sewers shall
have a narrow trench and maximum compaction of backfill to
prevent settlement of the superimposed surface or development.
B. Storm sewers shall be installed after excavating and filling in the
area to be traversed is completed, unless the storm sewer is
installed in the original ground with a minimum of three feet of
cover and adequate protection is provided during the fill
construction.
C. Storm sewers shall be designed with concrete cradle, the type of
which shall be approved by the Township, when traversing fill area
and/or with concrete anchors when grades exceed 20%.
D. Storm sewers shall be backfilled with PennDOT 2RC or PennDOT
2B coarse aggregate when traversing under paved areas and
shoulder areas.
E. Storm sewers shall be designed to adequately handle the
anticipated stormwater flow. Pipe within a Township right-of-way
shall have a minimum diameter of 15 inches, unless the Township
approves a smaller diameter.
§ 505 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 505
1:497
F. Storm sewers shall be constructed of one of the materials specified
in PennDOT Publication 408 Specifications, Sections 601, 602 and
603. All corrugated polyethylene pipe shall be Type S.
G. Trenching, bedding and backfilling requirements and materials
shall conform to the requirements of PennDOT Publications 408
Specifications, as supplemented and amended by this chapter.
H. Storm inlets and structures shall be designed to be adequate, safe,
self-cleaning and unobtrusive and consistent with PennDOT and
Township standards. The maximum spacing of inlets shall not
exceed 600 feet. Inlets shall be PennDOT Type C or M with cast-inplace
reinforced concrete or precast concrete tops.
I. The appropriate type grates shall be provided for all storm inlets,
structures and other entrance appurtenances.
J. Manholes shall be designed so that the top shall be at finished
grade and sloped to conform to the slope of the finished grade. Top
castings of structures located in roads or parking areas shall be
machined or installed to preclude "clanking."
K. Where a proposed storm sewer connects with an existing storm
sewer system, the developer shall demonstrate that sufficient
capacity exists in the downstream storm sewer system to the
handle the additional flow. The developer shall provide a letter from
the purveyor providing the existing storm sewer service approving
the connection of the proposed storm sewer system.
L. Storm sewer outfall shall be provided with either reinforced
concrete headwalls or pipe end sections and energy dissipation
devices to prevent erosion and conform to the applicable
requirements of the Pennsylvania DEP for stream encroachment
(Chapter 105 of the Pennsylvania DEP Rules and Regulations).
M. Storm sewers shall be placed in front of the curb or curbline when
located in a public street right-of-way. When storm sewers are
located in undedicated land, storm sewers shall be placed within an
easement not less than 20 feet wide as approved by the Township
Engineer, who may require additional width of easement as

maintenance of stormwater infiltration systems, flow attenuation
facilities and stormwater detention/retention facilities shall be the
responsibility of the developer or private management entity in
perpetuity.
B. If a development site is to be maintained in single ownership or if
storm sewers and other public improvements are to be privately
owned and maintained, then the ownership and operation/
maintenance of any and all stormwater control facilities shall be
the responsibility of the developer or private management entity in
perpetuity.
2. Facilities, areas, or structures used as SWM BMPs shall be enumerated
as permanent real estate appurtenances and recorded as deed
restrictions or conservation easements that run with the land.
3. The O&M Plan shall be recorded as a restrictive deed covenant that
runs with the land.
4. The municipality may take enforcement actions against an owner for
any failure to satisfy the provisions of this part.
1. Prior to final approval of the SWM site plan, the property owner shall
sign and record an operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement (see
Appendix A)35 covering all stormwater control facilities which are to be
privately owned. Said O&M agreement may be part of a land
development agreement with a developer at the option of the Township.

rights-of-way; building restriction lines; and the public
street(s) involved.
(b) Said Plat shall be accompanied with:
[1] Fully completed DEP sewage facilities planning module
form or letter from DEP stating form is not required.
[2] PennDOT and Federal occupancy permits.
[3] Storm water management Plan.
[4] Soil erosion, sedimentation and control plan with letter of
approval from the Blair County Conservation District or
other state and/or federal agency having jurisdiction
including supporting documentation and calculations.
[5] All Pennsylvania DEP permits.
[6] All other applicable permits and/or approvals.
(2) Minor subdivision of plans shall be submitted for review in
accordance with the procedures and standards of § 302A herein.
C. Stormwater Management Standards.
(1) All proposed stormwater control measures shall be evaluated
according to the following performance standard:
(a) Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff
characteristics shall implement such measures as are
reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or
other property. Such measures shall include such actions as
are required:
[1] To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff
after development is no greater than 75% of the maximum
rate of runoff prior to development activities or that
amount of runoff permitted pursuant to the County's
Stormwater Management Plan affecting the areas in
question if the County's said Plan is deemed by law to
supersede the Township's regulations with regard to the
issue of stormwater runoff; or have performed an
engineering study completed by a licensed professional
engineer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which
demonstrates that no detention is required, and such plan
is reviewed and recommended by the Logan Township
Engineer for approval by the Logan Township Board of
Supervisors.
§ 302 LOGAN CODE § 302
1:546
[2] The 75% release rate is applicable only in areas of the
Township not located in the Beaverdam Branch
Watershed. Within the Beaverdam Branch watershed, the
Act 167 plan requirements govern. If a licensed
Professional Engineer conducts a study that demonstrates,
by appropriate scientific and engineering concepts, that
the landowner/developer can effectively manage the
quantity, velocity and direction of resulting stormwater
runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects
the health and property from possible injury, the plan
requirements will be met.
[3] The stormwater management plan for the development
site shall consider all the stormwater runoff flowing over
the site.
[4] No discharge of toxic materials shall be permitted into any
stormwater management system. Where required by
federal and state regulation, the landowner or developer
shall be responsible for obtaining any required (such as
NPDES permit) permit for stormwater discharges.
[5] All land disturbance activities shall be conducted in such a
way as to minimize accelerated erosion and sedimentation.
Measures to control erosion shall at a minimum meet the
standards of the County Conservation District and the
rules and regulation of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
D. Mobile Home Parks. The subdivision and land development plan
submission and review procedures and the general design standards
and the specifications for Improvements set forth in the Township's
Code of Ordinances, including, but not limited to Chapter 22 thereof,
shall apply to the regulation of mobile home parks within the Township.
The mobile home park construction shall also conform to the
procedures and requirements contained within Chapter 8,
"Floodplains," of the said Code of Ordinances.
E. Plans and Procedures for the Submittal of Sketch Plans. Prior to the
submission of a Preliminary Plan and application for a subdivision and
land development plan, developers are encouraged to submit a sketch
plan to Logan Township. This will enable Logan Township to review the
proposal for the factors that may affect the development. Discussions
on sketch plans are intended as purely advisory and shall not exempt
the developer from any additional requirements of this or any other
ordinances affecting the development. Logan Township may, at its
discretion when requested by the applicant, submit the Sketch Plan to
the Township Engineer or Solicitor for review and comment in order to
provide the developer with more specific written directive.

No public improvements shall be taken over or accepted by the Board
of Supervisors unless the Township or its authorized agent or inspector
has inspected and given written approval of the construction of the public
improvements.
§ 305. Improvements Remain Private Until Accepted. [Ord. 5/17/79;
as amended by Ord. 7-7-94]
Although all public improvements shall be deemed to be an offer of
dedication to the Township upon appearance on and submission with the
final plan, every such public improvement including, but not limited to,
If the Logan Township Engineer or Logan Township Solicitor reviews
the Sketch Plan, the applicant shall provide Logan Township with a
deposit in accordance with the fee schedule to cover the cost of such
review. A sketch plan should contain the following information at a
minimum:
(1) Location map.
(2) General information concerning any community facilities and/or
any other man-made or natural features that will affect the
proposal.

improvement until such time as formally accepted by the Township or
condemned by the Township in the manner provided by law.
§ 306. Completion of Improvements or Guarantee Thereof
Prerequisite to Final Plat Approval and Stormwater Maintenance
Fund. [Ord. 5-17-79; as amended by Ord. 1-23-92A; by Ord.
10-12-00; and by Ord. 6-27-02]
A. Improvements/Guarantee - Final Plat Approval.
(1) No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such
plat have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by
this chapter and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire
hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers
and other improvements as may be required by this chapter have
been installed in accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the
completion of any improvements required as a condition for the
final approval of a plat, including improvements or fees otherwise
required by this chapter, the developer may deposit with the
Township financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the
costs of such improvements or common amenities including basins
and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open
space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required. The applicant shall not be required to provide financial
security for the costs of any improvements for which financial
security is required by and provided to the Department of
Transportation in connection with the issuance of a highway
occupancy permit pursuant to Section 420 of the Act of June 1,
1945 (P.L. 1242, No. 428) known as the "State Highway Law."
(2) When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing,
the Board of Supervisors, shall furnish the developer with a signed
copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent
upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The
final plat or record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the
financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or
letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be
revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within
90 days unless a written extension is granted by the Board of
Supervisors; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld
and shall be placed in writing at the request of the developer.
(3) Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in
such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial
security for the purposes of this section.
§ 305 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 306
1:549
(4) Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by
the party posting the financial security, provided said bonding
company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such
business within the Commonwealth.
(5) Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be required
on or before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or
accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements.
(6) The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost
for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
said adjustment, the Township may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this subsection.
(7) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
Township engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good
cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the Township are
unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer
licensed as such in this Commonwealth and chosen mutually by the
Township and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by
the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall
be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally
by the Township and the applicant or developer.
(8) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an
amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
§ 306 LOGAN CODE § 306
1:550
(9) In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plats by
sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvements in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally
approved section of the development.
(10) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the release, from time to time,
of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to
the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such
requests shall be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors,
and the Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of
such request within which to allow the Township engineer to
certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such portion of
the work upon the improvements has been completed in
accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification the
Board of Supervisors shall authorize release by the bonding
company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the
Township engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if the Board of Supervisors fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Board of Supervisors shall be
deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The
Board of Supervisors may, prior to final release at the time of
completion and certification by its engineer, require retention of
10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
(11) Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some of
the required improvements following completion, the Board of
Supervisors may require the posting of financial security to secure
structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning
of said improvements in accordance with the design and
specifications as depicted on the final plat for a term not to exceed
18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial
security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this
section with regard to installation of such improvements, and the
amount of the financial security shall not exceed 15% of the actual
cost of installation of said improvements.
(12) If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public
utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the
Township, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the
regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise
required by this section.
§ 306 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 306
1:551
(13) If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a
plat as set forth in this section, the Township shall not condition the
issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the
erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon
the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat upon actual
completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final
plat. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided,
occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall
not be withheld following the improvement of the streets providing
access to and from existing public roads to such building or
buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion-of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or
beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are
necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or
buildings.
B. Stormwater Maintenance Fund.
(1) Person installing stormwater storage facilities shall be required to
pay a specified amount to the Municipal Stormwater Maintenance
Fund to help defray costs of periodic inspections and maintenance
expenses. The amount of the deposit shall be determined as
follows:
(a) If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained,
the deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections
performed by the Township for a period of 10 years, as
estimated by the Municipal Engineer. After that period of time,
inspections will be performed at the expense of the Township.
(b) If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
Township, the deposit shall cover the estimated costs for
maintenance and inspections for 10 years. The municipal
engineer will establish the estimated costs utilizing
information submitted by the applicant.
(c) The amount of the deposit to the fund shall be converted to
present worth of the annual series values. The municipal
engineer shall determine the present worth equivalents which
shall be subject to the approval of the governing body.
(2) If a storage facility is proposed that also serves as a recreational
facility (e.g., ball field, lake), the Township may reduce or waive the
amount of the maintenance fund deposit based upon the value of
the land for public recreation purposes.
(3) If in the future a storage facility (whether publicly or privately
owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or
other storage facility, the unused portion of the maintenance fund
deposit will be applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and
§ 306 LOGAN CODE § 306
1:552
§ 307. Release from Improvement Bond. [Ord. 5-17-79; as amended
by Ord. 1-23-92A; and by Ord. 7-7-94]
connecting to the storm sewer system or other facility. Any amount
of the deposit remaining after the costs of abandonment are paid
will be returned to the depositor.
1. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of Supervisors, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township
engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall, within 10 days after receipt of

In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final
plat the Board of Supervisors is hereby granted the power to enforce
any corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If the proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient
to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Board of Supervisors may, at its
option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action
to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such
security, and not for any other Township purpose.

of one or more provisions of this chapter if the literal enforcement will
exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the
land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to
the public interest and that the purpose and intent of this chapter is
observed. When the literal compliance with mandatory provisions is
shown to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors to be

§ 403 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 404
1:569
1. General Provisions. The following applies to all areas of the Township,
unless more stringent criteria has been approved for specific areas that
are part of a DEP-approved Act 167 Plan or the like.
A. Any Developer, and each person, corporation, or other entity that
creates more than 5,000 square feet of impervious area shall be
required to prepare and submit a stormwater plan for review and
acceptance by the Township. Impervious areas shall include, but
not be limited to, any roof, parking, or driveway areas, and any new
roadways and sidewalks. Any areas designed to initially be gravel
or crushed stone shall be assumed to be impervious for the
purposes of these Specifications. These criteria shall apply to the
total development even if the development is to take place in
phases.
B. All proposed stormwater control measures shall be evaluated by
the Township according to the following performance standard:
(1) Any Developer, and each person, corporation, or other entity
engaged in the alternation or development of land which may
affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such
measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to
health, safety or other property. Such measures shall include
such actions as are required:
(a) To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff
after development is no greater the 75% of the maximum
rate of stormwater runoff prior to development activities
or that amount of runoff permitted pursuant to the
County's Stormwater Management Plan affecting the
areas in question if the County's said plan is deemed by
law to supersede the Township's regulations with regard
to the issue of stormwater runoff, and
(b) To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner that otherwise adequately
protects health and property from possible injury.
C. The stormwater plan for the development site shall consider all of
the stormwater runoff flowing over the site.
D. All land disturbance activities shall be conducted in such a way as
to minimize accelerated erosion and sedimentation. Measures to
control erosion shall at a minimum meet the standards of the
County Conservation District and the rules and regulations of the
Pennsylvania DEP.
E. No Developer or person, corporation, or other entity shall block,
impede the flow of, alter, construct any structure, or deposit any
material or thing, or commit any act which will affect normal or
flood flow in any communal stream or natural watercourse without
§ 404 LOGAN CODE § 404
1:570
having prior approval from the Township and/or the Pennsylvania
DEP, whichever is applicable.
F. Where a development site is traversed by a natural watercourse,
there shall be provided a drainage easement or right-of-way
conforming substantially to the line of such natural watercourse
and of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural drainage.
The terms of the easement or right-of-way shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of
the easement or right-of-way. Also maintenance, including mowing
of vegetation within the easement or right-of-way shall be required,
except as approved by the appropriate governing authority. If
applicable, the Developer shall obtain drainage easements or
rights-of-way from downstream property owners.
G. Financial security. All stormwater management facilities and
natural waterway management facilities must be included in the
financial security as required in Section 306 of Chapter 22 of the
Township of Logan Code of Ordinances.
2. Stormwater Runoff Quantity Control Standards.
A. Runoff Rates. The maximum rate of stormwater runoff discharge
from any activity covered by Chapter 22 of the Township of Logan
Code of Ordinances following completion of the activity (postdevelopment
conditions) shall not exceed 75% of the maximum rate
of stormwater runoff discharge that would have occurred from the
land prior to the activity (pre-development conditions) or that
amount of runoff permitted pursuant to the County's Stormwater
Management Plan affecting the areas in question if the County's
said Plan is deemed by law to supersede the Township's regulations
with regard to the issue of stormwater runoff. This criterion shall
apply to the total activity even if the activity is to take place in
stages. More stringent criteria may be required in sensitive areas
where stormwater problems presently exist. These requirements
may be modified based on a detailed engineering study completed
by a licensed professional engineer of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, on behalf of the developer, which demonstrates that
modification of these requirements is justified, and such plan is
reviewed and recommended by the Logan Township Engineer for
approval by the Logan Township Board of Supervisors.
(1) Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development site
are not subject to this control standard when determining
allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows
through the development site.
(2) Where the site area to be impacted through a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site
§ 404 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 404
1:571
area (less than 10%), only the proposed impact area shall be
subject to the runoff criteria.
B. Storm Frequencies. Stormwater management facilities proposed
for all development sites shall control the peak stormwater
discharge for the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year
storm frequencies. The USDA NARCS twenty-four-hour, Type H
Rainfall Distribution shall be used for analyzing stormwater runoff
for both pre- and post-development conditions. The twenty-fourhour
total rainfall for these storm frequencies in the watershed are:
Storm Frequency
Rainfall Depth
(inches)
2-year 2.6
10-year 3.8
25-year 4.6
100-year 6.1
C. Calculation Methods.
(1) Development Sites. For the purpose of computing peak flow
rates and runoff hydro graphs from development sites,
calculations shall be performed using one of the following:
USDA NARCS publications, Technical Release (TR) 55 or 20,
HEC I or Penn State Runoff Model (PERM.) or Modified
Rational Method. Under special circumstances other
computation methods may be used subject to the approval of
the Township Engineer.
(2) Stormwater Collection/Conveyance Facilities. For the purposes
of designing storm sewers and other stormwater runoff
collection and conveyance facilities, Rational Method or other
method as approved by the Township Engineer may be applied.
Rainfall intensities for design shall be obtained from the
PennDOT, Storm Intensity-Duration-Frequency Charts, as
amended to date.
(3) Routing of hydrographs through detention/retention facilities
for the purpose of designing those facilities shall be
accomplished using the Modified-Pulls Method or other
recognized reservoir routing method subject to the approval of
the Township Engineer.
(4) Predevelopment Conditions: Predevelopment conditions shall
be assumed to be those that exist on any site prior to
commencing any development activities. SCS runoff curve
numbers selected for use in the calculations shall accurately
reflect existing conditions subject to the approval of the
Township Engineer. The hydroponic conditions for all areas
§ 404 LOGAN CODE § 404
1:572
with pervious cover (i.e., fields, woods, lawn areas, pastures,
cropland, etc.) shall be assumed to be in "good" condition and
the lowest recommended SCS runoff curve number (CN) shall
be applied for all pervious land uses within the respective
range for each land use and hydroponic soil group. Impervious
cover shall include, but not be limited to, any roof, parking,
or driveway areas, and any new roadways and sidewalks. Any
areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be
assumed to be impervious for the purposes of these criteria.
The computed existing runoff rates shall be reconciled with
field observations and conditions. If the designer of the
stormwater management facilities can substantiate through
actual physical calibration that more appropriate runoff values
should be used at a particular development site, then
appropriate variations may be made upon review and approval
of the Township Engineer. Calibration shall require detailed
gauge and rainfall data for the particular development site in
question.
3. Stormwater Quality Management Requirements.
A. Applicability. In addition to the performance standards and design
criteria requirements of these Specifications, the Developer shall
implement the following water quality requirements unless
otherwise exempted by the provisions of these Specifications.
B. Water Quality Requirements.
(1) No regulated activities within the Township shall commence
until approval by the Township of a plan that demonstrates
compliance with State Water Quality Requirements after
construction is complete.
(2) Stormwater BMPs must be designed, implemented, and
maintained to meet State Water Quality Requirements, and any
other more stringent requirements as determined by the
Township.
(3) To control post-construction stormwater impacts from
regulated activities, State Water Quality Requirements can be
met by BMPs, including site design, which provide for
replication of pre-construction stormwater infiltration and
runoff conditions, so that post-construction discharges do not
degrade the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of
the receiving waters. This may be achieved by the following:
(a) Infiltration. Replication of pre-construction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
(b) Treatment. Use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
removal of the chemical and physical pollutants from the
stormwater runoff, and
§ 404 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 404
1:573
(c) Streambank and Streambed Protection. Management of
volume and rate of post-construction stormwater
discharges to prevent physical degradation of receiving
waters (e.g., from scouring).
[1] Provisions for the assurance of long-term operations
and maintenance of BMPs must be provided in
accordance with this chapter.
[2] Acceptable stormwater management BMPs must be
provided to manage the net increase in stormwater
runoff volume from the land development activities
from a two-year, twenty-four-hour frequency storm.
This equates to 2.6 inches of rainfall occurring over a
twenty-four-hour period.
[3] Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate PA DEP
regional office must be provided to the Township.
C. BMP Selection Criteria.
(1) BMP selection and application shall be in accordance with
guidance provided in the BMP handbooks and design manuals
published by PA DEP. In selecting the appropriate BMP's or
combinations thereof, the land developer shall consider the
following:
(a) Total contributing area.
(b) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(c) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(d) Seasonal high water table.
(e) Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
(f) Erodibility of soils.
(g) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
(2) The following additional factors should be considered when
evaluating the suitability of the BMP's used to control water
quality at a given development site.
(a) Peak discharge and required volume control.
(b) Streambank erosion.
(c) Efficiency of the BMP's to mitigate potential water quality
problems.
(d) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
§ 404 LOGAN CODE § 404
1:574
(e) The nature of the pollutant(s) being removed.
(f) Maintenance requirements.
(g) Recreation value.
(h) Enhancement of aesthetics and property values.
4. Design Requirements for Stormwater Management Controls.
A. General Criteria.
(1) The Developer may select runoff control techniques, or a
combination of techniques, which are most suitable to control
runoff from the development site. All controls shall be subject
to the approval of the Township Engineer. The Township
Engineer may request specific information on design and/or
operating features of the proposed stormwater management
controls in order to determine their suitability and adequacy in
terms of the standards of these Specifications.
(2) The Developer must consider the effect of the proposed
stormwater management techniques on any special soil
conditions or geological hazards that may exist on the
development site. In the event such conditions are identified on
the site, the Township Engineer may require in-depth studies
by a competent geotechnical engineer. Not all stormwater
methods may be allowable at a particular development site.
(3) In developing a stormwater plan for a particular site,
stormwater controls shall be selected according to the
following order of preference:
(a) Infiltration of runoff on-site, such as underground
perforated pipe with clean coarse aggregate backfill
wrapped with geotextile material.
(b) Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and
natural depressions.
(c) Construction of stormwater detention/retention
structures.
(4) Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to
reduce volume increases and promote groundwater recharge.
A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve
the applicable minimum control requirements. The Developer
shall provide justification for rejecting each of the preferred
practices based upon actual site conditions.
B. Design Criteria for Infiltration Systems.
(1) Infiltration systems shall be sized and designed based upon
local soil and ground water conditions.
§ 404 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 404
1:575
(2) All infiltration systems shall be located at least 10 feet from
basement walls.
(3) Infiltration systems shall not be used to handle runoff from
commercial or industrial working or parking areas. This
prohibition does not extend to roof areas that are
demonstrated to be suitably protected from the effects of the
commercial/industrial activities.
(4) Infiltration systems may not receive runoff until the entire
drainage area tributary to the system has received final
stabilization.
(5) The stormwater infiltration facility design shall provide an
overflow system with measures to provide a nonerosive
velocity of flow along its length and at the outfall.
(6) Roof drain infiltration facilities shall provide an effective
volume of at least one cubic foot for every two square feet of
roof surface.
(7) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase,
so as to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
C. Design Criteria for Flow Attenuation Facilities.
(1) If flow attenuation facilities are employed to assist in the
control of peak flows of discharge, their effects must be
quantified using SCS Technical Release (TR) 55, Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds or other method approved by
the Township Engineer. The effects of flow attenuation
facilities on travel time should be reflected in the calculations.
(2) Flow attenuation facilities such as swales and natural
depressions should be properly graded to ensure positive
drainage and avoid prolonged pending of water.
(3) Swales shall be properly vegetatively stabilized or otherwise
lined to prevent erosion.
(4) Swales shall be designed according to the recommendations
contained in the latest edition of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program
Manual latest edition.
D. Design Criteria for Stormwater Detention Facilities.
(1) If detention facilities are utilized for the development site, the
facility(ies) shall be designed such that post-development peak
runoff rates from the developed site are controlled to those
rates defined by this Part.
§ 404 LOGAN CODE § 404
1:576
(2) Shared-storage facilities that provide detention of runoff for
more than one development within a single subarea are
encouraged wherever feasible and provided such facilities
meet the criteria contained in these Specifications. In addition,
runoff from the developments involved shall be conveyed to the
facility in a manner that avoids adverse impacts (such as
flooding or erosion) to channels and properties located
between the development and the shared-storage facility.
(3) Where detention/retention facilities will be utilized, multiple
use facilities (such as wetlands, lakes, ballfields or similar
recreational/open space uses) are encouraged wherever
feasible, subject to the approval of the Township Engineer and
compliance with the Pennsylvania DEP's Chapter 105
regulations.
(4) Construction of the detention/retention facilities shall conform
to the construction specifications of the PennDOT Publication
408 Specifications, latest edition, and Standards for Roadway
Construction, RC 0- 100, latest edition.
(5) Design of the detention/retention facilities shall include the
following:
(a) Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and
installed to prevent erosion to the side slopes. Inflow and
outflow structures, pumping stations and other structures
shall be designed to minimize safety hazards.
(b) Bottoms of stormwater detention/retention basins shall be
graded with sufficient slope to provide positive surface
drainage. Bottoms of storage facilities shall be protected
from erosion. A sub-drainage system may be required
depending upon the location of the pond bottom relative to
groundwater levels.
(c) Stormwater detention/retention basins shall have an
emergency spillway. The emergency spillway shall have
capacity to handle a one-hundred-year storm with at least
one foot of freeboard. The Township may require more
stringent criteria in sensitive areas where stormwater
problems presently exist. Erosion protection shall be
provided for the emergency spillway compatible with the
computed maximum discharge velocity. The minimum size
of rock lining shall be PennDOT Class R-4.
(d) If the fill height for a stormwater detention/retention
facility exceeds five feet, a compaction study must be
performed. Fill must be place in compacted lifts. Where
the fill height exceeds five feet, compaction testing shall
be performed during construction and the Developer shall
provide the Township with documentation that the fill was
§ 404 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 404
1:577
compacted to a density of at least 95% of the Standard
Proctor (ASTM Specification D698).
(e) Side slopes of the stormwater detention/retention basins
shall not exceed a ratio of 2 1/2:1 horizontal to vertical
dimension. This requirement may be modified based on a
detailed engineering study completed by a licensed
professional engineer of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, on behalf of the developer, which
demonstrates that modification of these requirements is
justified, and such plan is reviewed and recommended by
the Logan Township Engineer for approval by the Logan
Township Board of Supervisors.
(f) Landscaping shall be provided for the stormwater
detention/retention facility that harmonizes with the
surrounding area. Vegetative cover shall be provided for
all areas disturbed by the construction of the storage
facilities, including the interior side slopes.
(g) Control and removal of debris both in stormwater
detention/retention structure and in all inlet and outlet
devices shall be a design consideration.
(h) Stormwater detention/retention facilities shall be located
to facilitate maintenance taking into consideration the
frequency and type of equipment that will be required.
(i) The perimeter of all detention/retention facilities shall be
completely fenced with a fence having a minimum height
of six feet. Said fence shall be constructed of chain link or
other similar material as may be approved by the
Township. A double gate having a minimum width of 12
feet shall be installed in the fence to provide access to the
stormwater storage facilities. The Developer shall furnish
a gate lock. To facilitate maintenance and inspection, all
stormwater storage facilities shall be provided with a
stabilized access road of a type subject to the approval of
the Township Engineer. When located on undedicated
land, the access road shall be placed within an easement
not less than 20 feet wide, as approved by the Township
Engineer, who may require additional width of easement
as circumstances warrant.
(j) Upon completion of the stormwater detention/retention
facilities, the Developer shall provide to the Township a
certification from an engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, certifying that said
facilities were constructed in accordance with these
Specifications and the plans approved by the Township.
§ 404 LOGAN CODE § 404
1:578
E. Design Criteria for Storm Drainage Collection/Conveyance
Facilities.
(1) All stormwater runoff collection and conveyance facilities shall
be designed in accordance with the following basic standards.
(a) Any property(ies) or water course(s) receiving stormwater
from a site shall contain an easement from the property
owner(s) granting permission to convey stormwater over
the property or water course. The existing points of
concentrated drainage that discharge onto adjacent
properties shall not be altered without a notarized
statement of approval from the adjacent property owner
(or downstream property owners if required by the
Municipal Engineer), accepting the revisions to the
concentrated flow. All such statements shall be recorded in
the County Recorder's office. Areas of existing diffused
drainage discharge onto adjacent properties shall be
managed such that, at minimum, the peak diffused flow
does not increase in the general direction of discharge,
except as otherwise provided in this chapter. If diffused
flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer must document that there
are adequate downstream conveyance facilities to safely
transport the concentrated discharge or otherwise prove
that no harm will result from the concentrated discharge.
Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be
subject to any applicable release rate criteria in the
general direction of existing discharge whether they are
proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused
drainage areas. The Developer must submit to the
Township a statement, properly acknowledged and
notarized, from the adjacent property owner (or
downstream property owners if required by the Municipal
Engineer), accepting the altered flow. All such statements
shall be recorded in the County Recorder's office at the
sole cost of the person obtaining the same.
(b) In order to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of runoff, roof drains shall not be connected to
roadways or storm sewers unless permitted on a case-bycase
basis by the Township. Lots located on the high side
of roadways shall extend footer drains to the curb line
storm sewer, if applicable. Low side lots shall extend footer
drains to a stormwater collection/conveyance/control
system or natural watercourse in accordance with the
approved stormwater plan for the development site. If
applicable, stabilized outlets shall be provided for all roof
drains and footer drains.
§ 404 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 404
1:579
(c) Collection/conveyance facilities shall not be installed
parallel and close to the top or bottom of a major
embankment to avoid the possibility of failing or causing
the embankment to fail.
(d) All stormwater drainage collection/conveyance facilities
shall be designed to convey the twenty-five-year storm
peak flow rate from the contributing drainage area and to
carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such as a stormwater
control facility, curbed roadway, storm sewer or natural
watercourse without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway. All stormwater drainage collection/conveyance
facilities shall be designed to convey the runoff from the
twenty-five-year design storm. Roadway crossings located
within designated floodplain area must be able to convey
runoff from the one-hundred-year design storm with a
minimum of 1.0 foot freeboard measured below the lowest
point along the top of the roadway. Stormwater drainage
collection/conveyance facilities must also be designed to
convey the one-hundred-year storm event to any
stormwater detention facilities so as not to endanger life
or seriously damage property.
(e) Stormwater drainage shall not be permitted to cross over
intersections or the crown of the road. Trench drains shall
be used to control drainage from entrances (driveways,
business accesses) to a road.
(f) When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions,
natural drainage ways on the development site cannot
adequately provide for drainage, open channels may be
constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade
of such natural drainage ways. Work within natural
drainage ways shall be subject to the approval of the
Pennsylvania DEP through the Joint Permit Application
process, or, where deemed appropriate by the
Pennsylvania DEP, through the General Permit process.

grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee claims an exemption
from taxation under this Subsection.

E. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the Local Services Tax, upon notification to an
employer by the person or by the Township of Logan that the
person has received earned income and net profits from all sources
within that political subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in

from the person pursuant to § 603, Subsection 2F, hereof.
F. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the Local Services Tax becomes subject to the tax for the
calendar year under § 603, Subsection 2E, the employer shall
withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The
employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period

shall be determined by dividing the combined rate of the local
services tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll
periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For
purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall
round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to
the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the Local
Services Tax levied hereunder shall be made on a payroll period
basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an

Every taxpayer who is self-employed or whose tax for any other reason
is not collected under section 4 of this Part shall file a return on a form

taxpayer that the pay statement is from the employee's principal
employer and the taxpayer will notify other employers of a change
in principal place of employment within two weeks of its
occurrence.
C. Each employer required to withhold the local services tax from a
taxpayer shall file a return or a form prescribed by the tax collector,

4. The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the
employee from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. Any employer
who fails to deduct the tax as required by this section, or who fails to
pay such tax to the tax collector, shall be liable for such tax in full,
without deduction of the commission hereinafter provided, as though
the tax had originally been levied against such employer.

may accept payment under protest of the tax claimed by the Township of
Logan in any case where any person disputes the Township of Logan's claim
for the tax. If a court of competent jurisdiction thereafter decides that there
has been overpayment to the tax collector, the tax collector shall refund
the amount of the overpayment to the person who paid under protest. Any
action instituted for such judicial determination shall be instituted within

between any two sexually oriented businesses shall be
measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening
§ 1001 LOGAN CODE § 1001
1:712
structures or objects, from the closest exterior wall of the
structure in which each business is located.
(e) A sexually oriented business lawfully operating on the date of
enactment of this Part that is in violation of § 1001B(1)(a) or (b)
of this Part 10 shall be deemed a nonconforming use.
(f) A sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a
conforming use is not rendered a nonconforming use by the
subsequent location of a church, public or private preelementary,
elementary or secondary school, public library,
child care facility, child-oriented business, nursery school or
public park or residence district within 1,000 feet of the
sexually oriented business.
(g) Section 1001B(1)(a) through (f) of this Part 10 does not apply

Pennsylvania, or a college, junior college, or university
supported entirely or partly by taxation;
[2] By a private college or university which maintains and
operates educational programs in which credits are
transferable to a college, junior college, or university
supported entirely or partly by taxation; or
[3] In a structure:
[a] Which has no sign visible from the exterior of the

[b] Where, in order to participate in a class, a student
must enroll at least three days in advance of the class;
and
[c] Where no more than one nude model is on the

(2) Campgrounds and/or Commercial Off-Road Vehicle Park. The
Zoning Hearing Board may authorize the issuance of a permit for
Campgrounds and/or Commercial Off-Road Vehicle Parks if the said
entities comply with the requirements of the Agriculture A-1
Zoning District as well as comply with the following:
(a) The type and character of the land uses adjacent to and in the
immediate area of the facility.
(b) The effect of the facility on water and sewer services, storm
water drainage, road capacity and volume of vehicle traffic and
traffic safety and circulation.

1:713
§ 1002. Yard Exceptions. [Ord. 11-15-79; as amended by Ord.
1-23-92]
(c) The effect of the facility on police and fire services and other
public safety and emergency services.

removal and similar services; control of noise, glare and
vibration; signs; outdoor lighting; and whether the facility
would be consistent with the intent and purposes of the
ordinance.
C. Separation Requirements.
(1) No residential use authorized under § 1001, Subsection A, above
shall be permitted if any other residential use listed in that
subsection or any nonconforming use is located in any residential
zoning district and within 500 feet from another measured by the
shortest distance between the lot on which the proposed use will be
located and the lot or lots which contain the existing use.
(2) Legislative intent. Certain uses in the various zoning districts,
while compatible with other lawful uses, can be detrimental to the
quiet use and enjoyment by others of their property if concentrated
in the same neighborhood. The Board of Supervisors has
determined that undue concentration can be avoided by mandating
a minimum distance of separation between these uses. Thus the
essential nature of the various districts can be maintained while
providing a broad level of inclusion for the variety of uses that
enrich our community.
1. For large scale housing developments:
A. Upon presentation to the Zoning Hearing Board of a site plan
showing location of buildings, streets, yards and other open spaces,
for the unified development of an area bounded on all sides by
street or park or other permanent public open space, the Board
may waive all side and rear yard requirements with respect to such
development, and direct the Zoning Officer to issue permits in
accordance with the approved plan thereof, provided:

§ 1015 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1017
1:721
C. Location: Required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the
same zoning lot as the structure or use that they serve unless a
joint use or off-site parking plan is approved (see Subsection H or I
below).
D. Design and Maintenance:
(1) Size. The minimum dimensions for a conventional parking
space will be nine feet in width by 18 feet in length, exclusive
of curbs and maneuvering space. For a handicapped parking
space, the size shall be 12.5 feet in width by 20 feet in length.
(2) Design. Each parking space shall open directly onto an aisle or
driveway with a minimum dimension of not less than 25 feet.
Driveways and aisles for other than single, two-family or
individual townhouse dwellings shall be designed so that each
vehicle may have ingress and egress from the space without
moving any other vehicle. All access ways shall be designed so
as to provide safe exit and entrance from the public street, in
accordance with applicable Township standards or PennDOT
specifications.
(3) Surfacing. All parking areas, including those for family
dwellings, shall be graded and paved or otherwise improved
with an all-weather, dustless material of asphalt, concrete,

parking space with a durable paint and maintained in said
manner.
(5) Signs. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, no signs shall
be displayed in any parking area within any residence district,
except as may be necessary for the orderly use of the parking
facilities.
(6) Storm Water. Adequate storm water drainage facilities shall be

abutting property or abutting sidewalks in such a way or
quantity that pedestrians using the sidewalk would be
detrimentally affected or inconvenienced.
(7) Maintenance. Parking spaces shall be kept clean of debris,
refuse and garbage and maintained so as to be free of potholes
and other defects which might constitute danger to persons or
property.

into, such landscaping. Clear sight triangles, as defined by this
Part, shall be maintained. Open parking areas for 50 or more cars
shall be interspersed with landform or other appropriate landscape
or planted area.
F. Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas
and driveways shall be directed away from residential properties or
public streets in such a way as not to interfere with such uses, and
all such lighting shall be arranged so as to protect the street or
highway and adjoining property from direct glare or hazardous
interference of any kind. Any luminary shall be equipped with some
type of glare shielding device approved by the Zoning Officer. The

(1) Two or more uses may share a common parking area provided
the total spaces equal or exceed the sum of the spaces required
for each use individually. However, the Board of Supervisors
may approve a joint parking plan which permits a reduction in
this total subject to the following:
(a) A written report shall be prepared by the applicant which
clearly demonstrates that one or more uses require
parking at times when other uses in the building or
complex are not normally in operation and, therefore, the
uses could share parking, thus reducing the total spaces
that otherwise would be required for all uses.
(b) Not more than 50% of the required parking spaces for any
one use shall be supplied jointly with other uses, except
that up to 100% of the spaces for a place of worship or
school may be supplied jointly with another use.
(c) All uses shall be located within 350 feet of the joint
parking spaces and connected by safe pedestrian access.
(d) A written agreement shall be executed with the Township
assuring the continued availability of the joint parking
spaces to all proposed uses.
(2) Any change or expansion of the uses sharing the joint parking
area shall require a new review by the Board of Supervisors
§ 1017 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1017
1:723
and may result in additional spaces being required and a
revised agreement with the Township.
(3) Continued compliance with approved joint parking plan is a
condition of occupancy; any violation thereof may result in the
suspension or revocation of the occupancy.
I. Off-site Parking Facilities: The Board of Supervisors may approve a
plan for providing all or some of the required off-street parking
spaces on a lot other than where the principal use is located,
provided that:
(1) Both lots are held in the same ownership, or a lease has been
executed for the spaces which guarantees their availability for
as long as the use exists. Evidence of ownership or a copy of
the lease shall be filed with the Township.
(2) The off-site parking spaces are located within 350 feet distance
from the principal use and connected by a safe pedestrian
walkway.
(3) The continued availability of the approved off-site parking shall
be a condition of occupancy for the principal use which they
serve; any violation thereof may result in the suspension or
revocation of the principal user's occupancy.
J. Parking for Recreational Vehicles: A recreational vehicle shall be
parked or stored in an off-street parking space.
3. Required Spaces by Type of Use.
A. When calculating the required number of spaces, a fractional space
of 1/2 or over shall be considered an entire space while a fraction
below 1/2 may be disregarded.
B. In the case of a single or two-family residence or townhouse unit, a
driveway for the dwelling may count as one off-street parking
space, provided such parking does not block access to parking for
another dwelling.
C. Wherever employee parking is required by this section, it shall be
calculated based on the number of employees on a peak shift.
D. The following shall be the minimum number of parking spaces
required; additional spaces may be required by the Township as a
result of the development application review.

§ 1109. Enforcement Notice. [Ord. 1-23-92]
1. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of
application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
2. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
1. If it appears to the Township that a violation of this chapter has
occurred, the Township shall initiate enforcement proceedings by
sending an enforcement notice as provided in this section.
2. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the
parcel on which the violation has occurred, to any person who has filed
a written request to receive enforcement notices regarding that parcel,
and to any other person requested in writing by the owner of record.
3. An enforcement notice shall state at least the following:
§ 1108 LOGAN CODE § 1109
1:742
§ 1110. Enforcement Remedies. [Ord. 11/15/1979; as amended by
Ord. 10/27/1988; and by Ord. 1-23-92]
A. The name of the owner of record and any other person against
whom the Township intends to take action.
B. The location of the property in violation.
C. The specific violation with a description of the requirements which
have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable provisions
of this chapter.
D. The date before which the steps for compliance must be
commenced and the date before which the steps must be
completed.
E. That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within a period of 10 days.
F. That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified,
unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board,
constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly described.
1. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon
being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the
district justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership
or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there was no
such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the district justice and thereafter each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
2. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to
grant to any person or entity other than the Township the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
3. District justices shall have initial jurisdiction over proceedings brought
under this section.

such deed restrictions duly recorded in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds as may be required by the Board of Supervisors for the
purpose of preserving the common open space or such use.
10. Maintenance of Open Space.
A. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
the common open space (including stormwater management
facilities), or any successor organization, shall at any time after
establishment of the planned residential development fail to
maintain the common open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the development plan, the Township
may serve written notice upon such organization or upon the
residents and owners of the PRD, setting forth the manner in which
the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable conditions, and said notice shall include a demand that
such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 30 days thereof,
and shall state the date and place of a hearing therein which shall
be held within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing the Township
may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies
and may give an extension of time within which they shall be
corrected. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in
the modifications thereof shall not be corrected within said 30 days
or any extension thereof, the Township, in order to preserve the
taxable values of the properties within the PRD and to prevent the
common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter
upon said common open space and maintain the same for a period
of one year. Said entry and maintenance shall not constitute a
taking of said common open space, and shall not vest in the public
any rights to use the common open space except when the same is
voluntarily dedicated to the public by the residents and owners and
such dedication is acceptable to the Township. Before the
expiration of said year, the Township shall, upon its initiative or
upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing upon
notice to such organization, or to the residents and owners of the
PRD, to be held by the Township, hearing such organization or the
residents and owners of the PRD shall show cause why such
maintenance by the Township shall not, at the election of the
Township, continue for a succeeding year. If the Township shall
determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain said
common open space in reasonable condition, the Township shall
cease to maintain said common open space at the end of said year.
If the Township shall determine such organization is not ready
and able to maintain said common open space in a reasonable
§ 1306 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1306
1:753
§ 1307. Design Standards. [Added by Ord. 12-09-04; as amended by
Ord. 09-14-06B; and by Ord. 06-12-08]
condition, the Township may, in its direction, continue to maintain
said common open space during the next succeeding year and
subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year
thereafter. The decision of the Township in any case shall constitute
a final administrative decision subject to judicial review.
B. The cost of such maintenance and enforcement proceedings by the
Township shall be assessed ratably against the properties within
the PRD that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space
and shall become a lien on said properties. Said assessment or
charges shall be subordinate in lien to the lien of any prior
mortgage or mortgages on the property which is subject to such
assessments or charges. The Township, at the time of entering
upon such said common open space for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien, in the office of the
Prothonotary of the County, upon the properties affected by such
lien within the PRD.
1. Site design.
A. All housing shall be designed with regard to topography and
natural features of the site. The effects of prevailing winds,
seasonal temperatures, and hours of sunlight on the physical layout
and form of the proposed buildings shall be taken into account.
B. Housing and other facilities near the periphery of the planned
residential development shall be designed so as to be harmonious
with neighboring areas.
2. Conservation of Trees and Natural Features.
A. The development shall be designed and programmed so as to
minimize earthmoving, erosion, tree clearance, and the destruction
of natural amenities.
B. Developers shall exercise care to protect trees from damage during
construction.
C. Trees with a minimum caliper of two inches shall be provided by
the developer where deemed necessary by the Board to mitigate
the loss of existing trees. Unless clearly infeasible, native species
shall be utilized.
3. Density and Spacing Requirements.
A. In this Part, where the word "former" is used, said word shall refer
to the zoning classification of a parcel of land prior to its having
been zoned PRD (planned residential development) under the
provisions of this section.
§ 1306 LOGAN CODE § 1307
1:754
B. The distance between buildings in a planned residential
development shall not be less than that required for in the former
district; however, the Board of Supervisors may permit reductions
in these requirements if it finds that through the use of topography,
sitting on the lot, or design, such building or buildings do not
infringe upon the privacy of adjacent, existing or potential
structures, provided that:
C. Front yard minimum setback distances shall be required as follows:
Type of Building
Distance From
Local and
Collector Streets
(feet)
Distance From
Arterial Streets
(feet)
Single-family
dwelling
20 100
Two-family and
multifamily
dwellings
30 100
Nonresidential 50 100
NOTES:
Streets will be defined as local, collector, or arterial by a traffic
study completed by the developer.
D. Nonresidential buildings shall not be located closer than 100 feet
from residential buildings.
E. Spacing shall be provided between buildings to ensure privacy and
sufficient light and air. Each development shall provide reasonable
visual and acoustical privacy for dwelling units. Fences, walks,
barriers and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for
protection and aesthetic enhancement of property, the privacy of
its occupants, the screening of objectionable views or uses and the
reduction of noise within the PRD tract, PRD sections and off site.
F. The proposed location and arrangement of structures shall not be
detrimental to existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the
existing or prospective development of the neighborhood. Multiple
story buildings shall be located within a planned residential
development in such a manner so as not to create an adverse
impact on adjoining low-rise buildings.
G. All structures shall be situated at least 50 feet from the property
line perimeter of the tract to be developed.
H. In order to encourage landowners to take advantage of the PRD
concept and to fulfill the intent of this Part, the Board of
Supervisors may permit up to and including the densities listed
§ 1307 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1307
1:755
below, provided that the development exhibits good project design,
provides maximum open space and encourages pedestrian
movement throughout. Each PRD shall consist of an appropriate
mix of dwelling types.
Former District PRD Density
R1 5 units per acre
R1A 5 units per acre
R2 10 units per acre
4. Height Regulations. No structure shall exceed 35 feet in height as
measured from the mean finished grade, nor contain more than three
stories, exclusive of attic and cellar. (Basements, as defined in this
chapter, shall be considered a story).
5. Streets and Walkways.
A. The design, dimensions, and construction of all streets shall comply
with the applicable standards in the Logan Township Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance. Where the Board finds that the
purposes of this chapter will be better served, however, it may
modify the terms of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance, provided that a comparable level of performance will be
achieved.
B. A traffic study, the scope of which is defined by the Township, must
be completed for all proposed PRDs.
C. Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of all roadways.
D. The street and walkway systems shall be designed so as to relate
harmoniously with land uses and adjacent streets, and to minimize
through traffic in residential areas. All residential parking and
recreational areas shall be connected by pedestrian walkways.
Walkways that connect residential areas and parking areas shall be
of a durable all-weather surface satisfactory to the Board.
E. Separation of vehicular from pedestrian and bicycle traffic is
encouraged. Where pedestrian walkways are not within a street
right-of-way, a walkway easement at least 10 feet in width shall be
designated. Where a walkway crosses over open space land,
however, the easement shall not be subtracted from the open space
land for purposes of calculating the area thereof.
F. Where dwelling units front on a collector or arterial street, no
direct vehicular access from the lot or tract to the street shall be
permitted.
G. Shade trees of varying species shall be planted along all streets
within the street right-of-way. At least one tree of minimum two-
§ 1307 LOGAN CODE § 1307
1:756
inch caliper and six-foot height on each side of the street shall be
provided for each 40 feet of street length, or fraction thereof.
6. Landscaping and Buffers.
A. All common parking areas shall be landscaped with trees and
shrubs of varying species. At least one shade tree of minimum twoinch
caliper and six-foot height shall be provided within the interior
of each parking area for every five parking spaces.
B. The Board may require that a planting strip be installed, along the
entire perimeter of the tract proposed for PRD or identified
segments thereof that adequately meets the following criteria.
(1) All existing trees two inches or more in caliper and/or six feet
or more in height shall be preserved, except when cutting
thereof is specifically approved by the Board or is necessary for
insuring adequate sight distance.
(2) The amount, density, and types of planting shall be based upon
physiographic features, feasibility of using native species,
proximity to existing dwellings, compatibility of adjacent uses,
and natural views. Where adjacent property has been
developed in such a manner that privacy from the PRD is
desirable, the planting strip adjacent thereto shall be of,
sufficient density and contain sufficient evergreen material to
effectively screen the portions of the PRD from which privacy is
desired. In other areas, particularly where the physiographic
features and existing vegetation provide an attractive setting,
the planting strip may be left in its natural state or enhanced
with additional plant material of lesser density than a full
screen.
(3) No planting shall be placed with its center closer than five feet
from a property line of the tract.
(4) Plantings shall be permanently maintained and, if necessary to
maintain an effective screen, replaced in the event they
become diseased or dead.
(5) Planting species shall be mixed; generally, a minimum of 25%
shall be evergreen and 10% flowering material.
(6) The required planting strip may be situated within private yard
space that abuts the tract boundary.
C. In addition to perimeter planting strips, the following landscaping
requirements shall be met:
(1) Disturbed topsoil shall be stockpiled, protected from erosion,
and replaced after construction. Planting and protection of
landscape material shall be in accordance with a plan and shall
be completed within six months of initial occupancy of each

material shall be submitted with the Final Plan.
7. Water Supply. The PRD shall be provided with a complete public water
distribution system. The design and installation of such public system
shall be subject to the approval of the Township.
8. Other Utilities. All other utility lines including, but not limited to,
electric, gas, street light supply, cable TV, and telephone shall be placed
underground. Installation of all utilities shall be in strict accordance
with the engineering standards and specifications of the Township,
municipal authority, or other public utility concerned. All such
underground utilities shall be put in place, connected, and approved
before the streets are constructed, where such utilities lie under the
proposed cartway, and before any person is permitted to occupy any
building to be served by such utilities.
1. Approval By Township. The application for tentative approval covers the
entire planned residential development and shows the location and
approximate time of construction for each stage, in addition to other
information required by this chapter. The phasing plan must be
approved by the Board and shall be revised and approved by the Board
each year.
2. Minimum Number Of Units. At least 15% of the dwelling units in the
plan given tentative approval are included in all but the final stage.
3. Improvements Necessary. The second and subsequent stages are
completed consistent with the approved tentative plan and are of such
size and location, including a sufficient degree of completion of the road
network and other infrastructure, that they constitute economically
sound units of development.
4. Common Space Required. Each phase shall include common open space
in amounts and at locations deemed acceptable by the Board to meet, at
minimum, the open space needs generated by that phase and to assure
protection of the sensitive features of the tract. If the public parkland is
not included in the first phase, surety must be posted for the eventual
dedication of this land.
5. Residential Density Requirements. Gross residential density may be
varied from stage to stage, provided that final approval shall not be
given to any stage if the gross residential density of the area which
includes stages already finally approved and the stage for which final
approval is being sought exceeds by more than 20% the gross
residential density allowed for the entire planned residential
development in the tentatively approved plan.

provided for in this Article, or within 180 days after the date of
filing of the application, whichever occurs first, the Board shall, by
official written communication to the landowner either:
(1) Grant tentative approval of the development plan as submitted;
§ 1310 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1310
1:763
(2) Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not
included in the development plan as submitted; or
(3) Deny tentative approval of the development plan.
Failure to so act within said period shall be deemed to be
a grant of tentative approval of the development plan as
submitted. In the event, however, that tentative approval is
granted subject to conditions, the landowner may, within 30
days after receiving a copy of the official written
communication of the Board of Supervisors, notify the Board
of his refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case, the
Board shall be deemed, to have denied tentative approval of
the development plan. In the event that landowner(s) does
not, within said period, notify the Board of his refusal to
accept all said conditions, tentative approval of the
development plan, with all said conditions, shall stand as
granted.
B. The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings
of fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the
reasons for the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial,
and said communication shall set forth in what respects the
development plan would or would not be in the public interest,
including but not limited to findings of fact and conclusions on the
following:
(1) Those respects in which the development plan is or is not
consistent with the comprehensive plan for the development of
the Township;
(2) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject
property, including but not limited to density, bulk, and use,
and the reasons, if any, why such departures are not deemed to
be in the public interest.
(3) The purpose, location, and amount of the common open space
in the planned residential development, the reliability of the
proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common
open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and
purpose of the common open space, and the adequacy or
inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common open
space as related to the proposed density and type of residential
development;
(4) The physical design of the development plan and the manner in
which said design does or does not make adequate provisions
for public services, provide adequate control over vehicular
§ 1310 LOGAN CODE § 1310
1:764
traffic, and further the amenities of light and air, recreation,
and visual enjoyment;
(5) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed
planned residential development to the neighborhood in which
it is proposed to be established; and
(6) In the case of a development plan which proposes development
over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and
conditions intended to protect the interests of the public and of
the residents of the planned residential development in the
integrity of the development plan.
C. In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with
or without conditions, the Board may set forth in the official written
communication the time within which an application for final
approval of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a
development plan which provide for development over a period
years, the periods of time within which applications for final
approval of each stage thereof shall be filed. Except upon the
consent of the landowner, the time so established between grant of
tentative approval and an application for final approval shall not be
more than three months and, in case of development over a period
of years, the time between applications for final approval of each
stage of a plan shall not be more than 12 months.
6. Status of Plan after Tentative Approval.
A. The official written communication provided for in Subsection 5B of
this section shall be certified by the Secretary of the Board of
Supervisors and shall be filed in the Township office, and a certified
copy shall be mailed to the landowner. Where tentative approval
has been granted, the same shall be noted on the Township Zoning
Map.
B. Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of
the planned residential development for recording nor authorize
development or the issuance of any building permits. A
development plan which has been given tentative approval as
submitted, or which has been given tentative approval with
conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and
provided that the landowner has not defaulted nor violated any of
the conditions of the tentative approval), shall not be modified or
revoked or otherwise impaired by action of the Township pending
an application, or applications for final approval, without the
consent of the landowner, provided an application for final approval
is filed or, in the case of development over a period of years,
provided applications are filed, within the periods of time specified
in the official written communication granting tentative approval.
C. Any changes to the tentatively approved development plan which
are proposed prior to the final plan submittal shall be submitted to
§ 1310 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1310
1:765
the Board of Supervisors for consideration and determination as
to whether or not the changes are substantial enough to require
a public hearing prior to approval. If the Board of Supervisors
determines a public hearing is not required, the plan may move
to the final approval stage. If the Board of Supervisors determines
a public hearing is necessary, the process outlined in subsections
public hearings and findings, above, shall be followed. If a public
hearing is required to review the revised plan, the applicant shall
be responsible for payment of the fee for the legal advertising
notice. Upon tentative approval, the applicant shall provide the
Township with three copies of the revised master plan.
D. In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval
and thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect
to abandon said development plan and shall so notify the governing
body in writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to file an
application or applications for final approval within the required
period of time or times, as the case may be, the tentative approval
shall be deemed to be revoked and all that portion of the area
included in the development plan for which final approval has not
been given shall be subject to those local ordinances otherwise
applicable thereto as they may be amended from time to time, and
the same shall be noted on the zoning map and in the records of the
Township Secretary.
E. A development plan which has been given tentative approval shall
submit street, sanitary, water and stormwater plans for the entire
development to be approved by the Township Engineer. The plans
shall include information sufficient for review and approval of a
pre-final design as required by the Township ordinances for a
preliminary subdivision plan. Approval of this submission is
required prior to any final plan submissions for separate section(s)
or the complete development. Review shall be within 90 days of the
submission or resubmission date. Pre-final design submission must
be reviewed and approved by the Director of Planning and Zoning,
fire chief, water and sewer provider, and Township Engineer.
7. Application for Final Approval. An application for final approval may be
for all the land included in a development plan or, to the extent set forth
in the tentative approval, a section thereof. Said application shall be
made to the Department of Planning and Zoning and within the time or
times specified by the official written communication granting tentative
approval. The application shall include the documents as outlined
below.
A. Ten copies of the final plan, prepared or certified by a registered
engineer or surveyor in accordance with the Township's
Subdivision [Chapter 22] and Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27],

all buildings, parking areas, pedestrian ways, utilities, utility
easements, lot lines, the location and size of all open space not
§ 1310 LOGAN CODE § 1310
1:766
devoted to parking lots, streets or driveways, the proposed use of
all lands and buildings and the metes and bounds of all proposed
dedicated areas and lots.
B. Restrictive covenants executed by all owners of the premises
within the section covered by the final plan which, if approved,
shall be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of Blair County. The
restrictive covenants shall be effective for a period of at least 35
years, except that covenants relating to stormwater management
facilities, parks, recreation and other open space areas shall
provide that the same remain as such perpetually.
C. Any additional conditions set forth at the time of tentative approval.
8. Optional Public Hearing. A public hearing on an application for final
approval of the development plan, or part thereof, shall not be required
provided that the development, or part thereof, submitted for final
approval is in compliance with the development plan theretofore given
tentative approval and with any specified conditions attached thereto.
9. Time Requirements On Approval. In the event the application for final
approval has been filed, together with all drawings, specifications, and
other documents in support thereof, and as required by the Ordinance
and the official written communication of tentative approval, the
Township shall, within 45 days from the date of the regular meeting of
the Board of Supervisors or Planning Commission, whichever first
reviews the plans, next following the date the application is filed, grant
such development plan final approval provided, however, that should
the next regular meeting occur more than 30 days following the filing of
the application, the forty-five-day period shall be measured from the
30th day following the day the application was filed.
10. Disapproval Procedures. In the event the development plan as
submitted contains variations from the development plan given
tentative approval, the approving body may refuse to grant final
approval and shall, within 45 days from the date of the regular meeting
of the governing body or the planning agency, whichever first reviews
the application, next following the date the application is filed, so advise
the landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the
reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the public
interest. Provided, however, that should the next regular meeting occur
more than 30 days following the filing of the application, the forty-fiveday
period shall be measured from the 30th day following the day the
application has been filed. In the event of such refusal, the landowner
may either:
A. Refile his application for final approval without the variations
objected; or
B. File a written request with the approving body that it hold a public
hearing on his application for final approval.
§ 1310 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1310
1:767
If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action he
may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply
for final approval, or within 30 additional days if the time for
applying for final approval shall have already passed at the time
when the landowner was advised that the development plan was
not in substantial compliance. In the event the landowner shall
fail to take either of these alternate actions within said time, he
shall be deemed to have abandoned the development plan. Any
such public hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice with
30 days after request for the hearing is made by the landowner,
and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner described in this
article for public hearings on applications for tentative approval.
Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, the approving
body shall by official written communication either grant final
approval to the development plan or deny final approval. The
grant or denial of final approval of the development plan shall, in
cases arising under this section, be in the form and contain the
findings required for an application for tentative approval set forth
in this article. Failure of the governing body or agency to render
a decision on an application for final approval and communicate
it to the applicant within the time and in the manner required
by this section shall be deemed an approval of the application
for final approval, as presented, unless the applicant has agreed
in writing to an extension of time or change in the prescribed
manner of presentation of communication of the decision, in which
case, failure to meet the extended time or change in manner or
presentation of communication shall have like effect.
11. Recording of Approved Plan. A development plan, or any part thereof,
which has been given final approval shall be so certified without delay
by the approving body and shall be filed of record forthwith in the office
of the recorder of deeds before any development shall take place in
accordance therewith. Upon the filing of record of the development
plan the zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the
land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto. Pending
completion, in accordance with the time provisions stated in the
tentative approval of said planned residential development or of that
part thereof, as the case may be, that has been finally approved, no
modification of the provisions of said development plan, or part thereof,
as finally approved, shall be made except with the consent of the
landowner. Upon approval of a final plan, the developer shall record the
plat and post financial surety in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 22.
12. Abandonment After Approval. In the event that a development plan, or a
section thereof, is given final approval and thereafter the landowner
shall abandon such plan or the section thereof that has been finally
approved, and shall so notify the Board of Supervisors in writing; or, in
the event the landowner shall fail to commence and carry out the
planned residential development within such reasonable period of time

applications.
5. Enforcement Remedies. Any person, partnership, corporation, who or
which has violated the planned residential development provisions of
any ordinance enacted under this act or prior enabling laws shall, upon
being found liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by a municipality, pay a judgment of not more than $500
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by a
municipality a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the municipality may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the appropriate rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the
district justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership
or corporation violating the ordinance to have believed that there was
no such violation, in which even there shall be deemed to have been
only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the district justice, and thereafter each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the
violation of planned residential development provisions shall be paid
over to the municipality whose ordinance has been violated.
The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.

A. Small Wind Energy Systems: Notwithstanding any provision in this
chapter to the contrary, small wind energy systems shall be permitted
only by special exception from the Zoning Hearing Board in all zoning
districts. A building permit shall be required for the installation and/or
modifications of all small wind energy systems.
B. If the applicant is granted a special exception for a small wind energy
system, the Township, at any time after the grant of the special
exception, may require the applicant to provide a form of surety (i.e.,
post a bond, letter of credit or establish an escrow account or other as
may be approved by the Township Solicitor) if the Township Zoning
Officer determines that the small wind energy system is not in
compliance with the terms of this chapter and/or any other applicable
federal, state or local law/regulation. The enforcement notice
provisions of this chapter shall govern any such notice of violation and
such notice shall require the applicant, within the time period stated in
the notice, to both correct the violation and provide the surety required.
Said surety shall be in an amount, as determined by the Township, to
cover costs of the removal in the event the Township must remove the
facility. The applicant shall submit a fully inclusive estimate of the costs
associated with the removal, prepared by a qualified engineer. The
amount shall include a mechanism to accommodate the rate of inflation
over 15 years. The Township Zoning Hearing Board may also require
such security at the time of the approval of the application for special
exception.
C. All small wind energy systems installed prior to the enactment of this
Part are exempt from the conditions herein, however any such
previously installed small wind energy system shall be subject to the
nonconformity provisions of this chapter.

written permission through a recorded easement allowing the
small wind energy system's fall zone to overlap with the
abutting property.
(d) Any travel ways to include but not be limited to driveways,
parking lots, nature trails or sidewalks.
(2) If an abutting landowner disapproves on record during the special
exception hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board, of the
proposed small wind energy system, the said system shall be set
back a distance equal to 220% of the total height from all property
lines.
(3) The setback shall be measured to the center of the tower's base.
(4) Guy wires used to support the tower are exempt from the small
wind energy system setback requirements.
B. Tower.

shall be permitted to be placed on a building in a residentially
zoned district.
(3) The applicant shall provide evidence that the proposed tower
height does not exceed the height recommended by the
manufacturer of the wind turbine and that object on which the
proposed tower is to be placed is capable of supporting such
proposed tower.
§ 1506 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1506
1:783
(4) No small wind energy system shall be located in a front yard in a
residential district.
(5) There shall be no more than two small wind energy systems per
parcel containing a building, unless such parcel is in excess of two
acres, in which event two small wind energy systems shall be
permitted for every additional two acres.

system must have been approved by the California Energy Commission
or the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or
a similar list approved by the state of Pennsylvania, if available.
L. Clearing. Clearing of natural vegetation shall be limited to that which is
necessary for the construction, operation and maintenance of the small
wind energy system and as otherwise prescribed by applicable laws,
regulations, and ordinances.
A. At such time that a small wind energy system is scheduled to be
abandoned or discontinued, the applicant will notify the Township
Zoning Officer by certified U.S. mail of the proposed date of
abandonment or discontinuation of operations.
§ 1506 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1507
1:785
B. Upon abandonment or discontinuation of use, the owner shall
physically remove the small wind energy system within 90 days from
the date of abandonment or discontinuation of use. This period may be
extended at the request of the owner and at the discretion of the

limited to:
(1) Removal of the small wind turbine and tower and related abovegrade
structures.
(2) Restoration of the location of the small wind energy system to its
natural condition, except that any landscaping, grading or belowgrade
foundation may remain in the after-conditions.
C. In the event that an applicant fails to give such notice, the system shall
be considered abandoned or discontinued if the system is out-of-service
for a continuous twelve-month period. After the 12 months of
inoperability, the Township Zoning Officer may issue a notice of
abandonment to the owner of the small wind energy system. The owner
shall have the right to respond to the notice of abandonment within 30
days from notice receipt date. The Township Zoning Officer shall
withdraw the notice of abandonment and notify the owner that the
notice has been withdrawn if the owner provides information that
demonstrates the small wind energy system has not been abandoned.
D. If the owner fails to respond to the notice of abandonment or if after
review by the Township Zoning Officer it is determined that the small
wind energy system has been abandoned or discontinued, the owner of
the small wind energy system shall remove the small wind turbine and
tower at the owner's sole expense within three months of receipt of the
notice of abandonment. If the owner fails to physically remove the small
wind energy system after the notice of abandonment procedure, the
Township shall have the authority to enter the subject property and
physically remove the small wind energy system, in which event, the
Township shall, in addition to any and all other remedies it may have
available, have the authority to place a municipal lien against the
