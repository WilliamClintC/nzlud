to implement the purposes of the Codes. The Board shall grant a
waiver only for the specific time frame necessary to adequately

1. Purpose/Scope/Declaration of Policy and Findings.
A. It is the purpose of this Part and the policy of the Borough Council
of the Borough of Gettysburg, in order to protect and promote the
public health, safety and welfare of its citizens, to establish rights
and obligations of owners and occupants relating to the rental of
certain dwelling units in the Borough of Gettysburg and to
encourage owners and occupants to maintain and improve the
quality of rental housing within the community. It is also the policy
of the Borough that owners, managers and occupants share
responsibilities to obey the various codes and ordinances adopted
to protect and promote public health, safety and welfare. It is
further the policy of the Borough to protect the quality of life of
those Borough residents who live within traditionally residential
neighborhoods in which existing housing has been converted into
non-owner-occupied rental properties. It is also the policy of the
Borough to maintain the high quality of its housing stock and to
further protect the value of its housing stock. As a means to those
ends, this Part provides for a system of inspections, issuance and
renewal of occupancy licenses and sets forth penalties for
violations. This Part shall be liberally construed and applied to
promote its purposes and policies.
B. In considering the amendment of this Part, the Borough Council of
the Borough of Gettysburg makes the following findings:
(1) There is a greater incidence of violations of various codes and
ordinances of the Borough at residential properties where
owners do not reside in the Borough and rent such properties
to one or more individuals than at owner-occupied residential
properties.
(2) There is a greater incidence of problems with the maintenance
and upkeep of residential properties where owners do not
reside in the Borough and rent such properties to one or more
individuals than at owner-occupied residential properties.
(3) There is a greater incidence of disturbances which adversely

maintenance and repair of the premises under any code(s) within the
period of time stated in such notice, the Borough may cause the
violation to be corrected. There shall be imposed upon the owner a
charge of the actual costs involved, plus 10% of said costs for each time
the Borough shall cause a violation to be corrected and the owner of the
premises shall be billed after same has been completed. Any such bill

any code violations in the inspection conducted in conjunction with
the issuance of the license, the Code Enforcement Officer may

or manager of a regulated rental unit for which a license is required, to
operate without a valid, current license issued by the Borough

fine of not more than $1,000 and the cost of prosecution. Every day that
a violation of this Part continues shall constitute a separate offense.
3. Nonexclusive Remedies. The penalty provisions of this Section and the
license nonrenewal, suspension and revocation procedures provided in
this Part shall be independent, nonmutually exclusive separate
remedies, all of which shall be available to the Borough as may be
deemed appropriate for carrying out the purpose of this Part. The
remedies and procedures in this Part for violation hereof are not
intended to supplant or replace, to any degree, the remedies and
procedures available to the Borough in the case of a violation of any
other code or ordinance of the Borough whether or not such other code
or ordinance is referenced in this Part and whether or not an ongoing
violation of such other code of ordinance is cited as the underlying

given to a manager shall be deemed as notice given to the owner.

be given to the owner under this Part shall have been received by
such owner if the notice was given to the owner in the manner
provided by this Part.
C. A claimed lack of knowledge by the owner of any violation
hereunder cited shall be no defense to license nonrenewal,
suspension or revocation proceedings as long as all notices
prerequisite to institution of such proceedings have given and
deemed received in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Part.
2. Changes in Ownership Occupancy. It shall be the duty of each owner of
a regulated rental unit to notify the Borough in writing of any change in
§ 4-306 GETTYSBURG CODE § 4-307
FWD:96
ownership of the premises. It shall also be the duty of the owner
to notify the Borough in writing of the changing of a dwelling unit
from owner-occupied to tenant-occupied, which thereby transforms the
dwelling into a regulated rental unit for purposes of this Part.
3. Owners Severally Responsible. If a regulated rental unit is owned by
more than one person, in any form of joint tenancy, as a partnership or
otherwise, each person shall be jointly and severally responsible for the
duties imposed under the terms of this Part and shall be severally
subject to prosecution for the violation of this Part.

IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS
§ 8-300. Identification. [Ord. 1358-09, 1/12/2009]
The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Borough of
Gettysburg subject to the one-hundred-year flood, which is identified as
Zone A (Area of Special Flood Hazard) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
dated February 18, 2009, and the accompanying maps or the most recent
revision thereof as issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
This shall include all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
§ 8-301. Description of Floodplain Areas. [Ord. 1358-09, 1/12/2009]
1. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
A. FW (Floodway Area)  the areas identified as "Floodway" in the AE
Zone in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The term shall also
include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those floodplain
areas where no floodway has been identified in the Flood Insurance
Study.
B. FF (Flood-Fringe Area)  the remaining portions of the onehundred-
year floodplain in those areas identified as an AE Zone in
the Flood Insurance Study where a floodway has been delineated.
The basis for the outermost boundary of this area shall be the onehundred-
year flood elevations as shown in the flood profiles
contained in the Flood Insurance Study.
C. FE (Special Floodplain Area)  the areas identified as Zone AE in
the Flood Insurance Study where one-hundred-year flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
delineated.
D. FA (General Floodplain Area)  the areas identified as Zone A in
the Flood Insurance Study for which no one-hundred-year flood
elevations have been provided. When available, information from
other Federal, State, and other acceptable sources shall be used to
determine the one-hundred-year elevation as well as the floodway
area, if possible. When no other information is available, the onehundred-
year elevation shall be determined by using a point on the
boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site in question.
2. In lieu of the above, the Borough may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only

unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public
expense nor create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the
public, or conflict with any other applicable state or local
ordinances or regulations.
H. A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall
be maintained by the Borough. In addition, a report of all variances
granted during the year shall be included in the annual report to

§ 11-110. Matters to be Considered by the Board in Reviewing
Applications. [Ord. 1118-91, 8/12/1991, § 110]
1. The Board shall meet publicly at least once each month at regularly
scheduled and advertised meetings. The Board may hold additional
meetings, which must be advertised, in order to carry out the
responsibilities indicated in §§ 11-107 and 11-108 of this Part.
2. On considering applications for all projects, including signs, the Board
shall begin by briefly stating the architectural style of the building and
noting its distinctive features, including the degree of architectural
integrity it possesses. When appropriate, information about
neighboring buildings or streetscape may be included. The Board shall
present to the applicant whatever newly obtained historical information
it has about the building and may supply him/her with a copy of the
documentation. These statements and presentations shall be done in a
manner to awaken applicants' interest in their buildings.
3. The Board shall invite applicants or their representatives to explain
their projects and their reasons for applying and may question them in
regard to details. The Board may invite other persons with appropriate
expertise to attend its meetings to observe or advise.
1. Alterations that can be seen from a public street, alley or other public
space are to be considered essential in determining the
recommendations to be presented to the Borough Council concerning
the issuing of a certificate of appropriateness for an application. In
making its determinations, the Board shall consider the following
matters:
A. The effect of the proposed change upon the general historic and
architectural nature of the district.
B. The effect of the proposed change upon the overall appearance of
the street on which it is located, including continuity of the building
line.
C. The following architectural features of the building and/or site
under consideration along with the compatibility with those of
neighboring buildings shall be taken into account:
(1) Modifications to its architectural style that have been made
over time. In consultation with the applicant, a decision should
be made whether a return to its original style is appropriate or
whether style or characteristics that the building possessed at
some later period should be preferred.
(2) Appropriate proportions in the height and width of facades and
of the doors and windows therein.
(3) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on the street, including
placement of windows or doors on exposed side elevations,
§ 11-109 FOREWORD § 11-110
FWD:221
which helps to achieve the appearance of an intact line of
buildings and uniformity in their relationship to the street.
(4) Historic authenticity of entrance and/or porch projections and
rhythm of such elements on the street as a whole.
(5) Compatibility of textures of building materials as combined on
the building and in relation to textures of neighboring
buildings.
(6) Historic authenticity and/or compatibility of architectural
details, including, but not limited to, siding, arches,
balustrades, brackets, cornices, cupolas, doors, ironwork,
lintels, quoins, shutters, storm windows, window design, etc.,
in relation to the structure under consideration and to adjacent
ones.
(7) Compatibility of roof shapes on parts of the building under
consideration and in relation to neighboring buildings.
(8) The importance of fences and walls to the cohesiveness of the
building line, and historic appropriateness of the materials
from which these are made, such as brick or stone walls,
wrought-iron or wooden picket or plank fencing. The function
of fences and walls in concealing parking spaces from street
view may also be considered.
(9) Location of air-conditioner, ventilation and heating systems
and broadcast reception devices, so as to be as inconspicuous
as possible. Applicants shall be encouraged to remove
nonfunctional reception devices.
(10) Scale of buildings and architectural detail as relates to human
size, bearing in mind that the streets of the Historic District
were developed at a time when walking was the primary means
of moving about and buildings were intended to be viewed
from this perspective.
(11) In addition, the Board may offer advice on colors, paving
materials or living landscaping features, but approval may not
be denied on these grounds. Such advice might include
discussion of historically authentic paint colors along with
compatibility of color combinations on the building and in
relation to colors of neighboring buildings and placement of
screening hedges or appropriateness of paving materials with
use of brick for public walkways and brick, cobblestone or
flagstone for walkways within yards and pebblestone for
driveways and parking spaces encouraged in preference to
concrete or asphalt.
D. The effect of the proposed change upon the future condition of the
building and possibility of restoration in the future.
§ 11-110 GETTYSBURG CODE § 11-110
FWD:222
(1) The removal, alteration or covering of any historic material or
distinctive architectural features should be avoided when
possible. If any such items are removed, they shall be properly
recorded and, if possible, stored for future study or reuse. If
historic material is covered, precautions should be taken that
such features not be damaged.
(2) Whenever possible, additions or alterations to buildings shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations
were to be removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.
(3) The surface cleaning of masonry shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning
methods that will damage the historic building materials shall
not be undertaken. When brick has been painted in the past,
repainting rather than paint removal shall be recommended.
E. Contemporary design for additions to existing buildings that
differentiate between old and new parts shall not be discouraged
when such additions do not destroy significant historic,
architectural or cultural material and such design is compatible
with the size, scale, color, material, aesthetics and character of the
building.
F. Contemporary design for new buildings shall be encouraged,
provided the design is compatible with existing neighboring
structures in scale, size, color, building materials and other
considerations listed in Subsection 1C of this section.
2. The height of any new buildings or structures shall not exceed the
height of the tallest adjacent building or structure by more than 10%.
This requirement shall also apply to any proposed modifications to
existing buildings or structures. However, the Board may recommend
grant of a variance from this height limitation where it determines that
an unnecessary hardship is caused thereby and that grant of the
recommended variance will not have an inappropriate effect on either
the building or structure involved or on the general historic and
architectural nature of the district; provided that if the building or
structure is constructed to a height taller than any adjacent building or
structure, no building or structure adjacent to it shall thereafter be
constructed to a still greater height without the grant of variance as
herein provided.
3. Demolition.
A. Application Requirements.
(1) An individual or entity proposing to raze or demolish a building
in the Historic District shall first submit a written application,
in a form provided by the Borough, which shall contain the
following information:

deteriorated condition of the building.
(g) The reason or reasons for the proposed demolition.
(h) An explanation as to why rehabilitation, reuse, plan
alteration, or stabilization with the intent to market and
sell the property is not feasible or desirable.
(i) A statement on the proposed disposition of architectural
features/building materials.
(2) The Borough Planning Department shall prepare a report to
the Board that includes: the maintenance of the building by the
applicant/owner since it was acquired; whether the applicant/
owner has neglected maintenance to destroy the building's
historic integrity or its structural integrity; whether the
applicant/owner has removed architectural fixtures from the
exterior of the structure or otherwise damaged the property;
and any previous or current code enforcement citations.
(3) An application involving demolition of a sensitive building, as
defined in this Part, shall not be deemed complete or be
considered by the Board unless the following information is
also submitted for review and consideration:
(a) An appraisal report relative to the fair market value of the
subject property obtained by the applicant/owner for the
purpose of obtaining financing or for other purposes.
(b) A report by a registered professional engineer, with
experience in structural engineering, setting forth an
opinion of the structural integrity of the building to be
razed or demolished and any other useful information. The
payment of costs of such report shall be the responsibility
of the applicant/owner. The Borough shall forward the
report to an independent registered professional engineer
for review and recommendation to the Board.
§ 11-110 GETTYSBURG CODE § 11-110
FWD:224
(c) Two written cost proposals from qualified contractors to
determine both the cost of the repairs required to bring
the building into conformity with all applicable codes and

buildings, utilities, rights-of-way, easements, entrances,
and/or exits on said property as well as a site plan showing
new structures, utilities, rights-of-way, easements,
entrances, and/or exits.
(e) A list of bona fide offers for sale or lease of said property
and, if the property is for sale, a copy of the contract listing
the sales agreement.
(f) At its discretion, the Board may request that a study be
completed and a report of such study be prepared by an
architect or planner with a background in historical
preservation. The study shall address the relationship of
the building proposed to be demolished to the Historic
District, as well as the impact the demolition of the
building and site development will have on the immediate
block or area where it is located. The cost and review of
such study shall be the responsibility of and shall be paid
for by the applicant/owner.
B. Criteria.
(1) In making a recommendation to the Borough Council
regarding the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness
where a permit is sought for demolition of a building within the
Historic District, the Board shall consider the following
criteria:
(a) Whether the building under consideration for demolition
contributes to the character of the Historic District or if
the building has significant historic character.
(2) In requesting the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness
for demolition, the applicant/owner shall provide credible
evidence that the following conditions exist:
(a) The existing building cannot feasibly and reasonably be
reused or is structurally unsound, and that its condition is
not the result of the intentional neglect or the demolition
by neglect by the applicant/owner.

[1] The applicant/owner has demonstrated that the
condition of the building constitutes a serious and
immediate threat to the safety of the public or
occupants, that cannot be eliminated without repairs
required to meet specified safety code standards, that
would exceed 50% of the appraised value of the
structure itself documented in § 11-110, Subsection
3A(3)(a) and (c).
[2] The applicant/owner has demonstrated that there
would be no reasonable long-term economic benefit
from the preservation of the building. In making a
claim of unreasonable economic hardship in § 11-110,
Subsection 3C, all potential uses for the building shall
be thoroughly examined and addressed in the
application. When a claim of unreasonable economic
hardship is being made in reference to a proposed
demolition pursuant to this Part, the owner/applicant
shall present evidence sufficient to prove that, as a
result of denial of a demolition permit, the owner/
applicant is unable to obtain a reasonable return or a
reasonable beneficial use from the property. The
owner/applicant of record shall submit by affidavit to
the Board all the information set in § 11-110,
Subsection 3C. An assertion that the owner/applicant
can achieve a greater economic return by demolishing
the building or that the owner lacks adequate funds to
pursue potential uses or adaptive reuses is considered
to be insufficient to sustain a claim of unreasonable
economic hardship.
(c) The demolition is necessary to allow a project to occur that
will have substantial public benefit which outweighs the
loss of the building, and the proposed project must occur
at that specific site.
(d) The demolition will result in a new building that will be an
improvement to the character of the Historic District,
considering the architectural design proposed for the new
building.
(e) The building proposed for demolition does not contribute
to the character of the Historic District.
(3) When the Board deems a proposed demolition undesirable, it
may recommend that the demolition be postponed for a period
not to exceed nine months for the consideration of the
application by the Borough Council. During this period, so as to
render demolition unnecessary, the Board and Borough
Planning Department shall make all reasonable efforts in
§ 11-110 GETTYSBURG CODE § 11-110
FWD:226
identifying alternatives to demolition or resolving problems
that resulted in the request for the proposed demolition.
(4) In the case where the Board recommends and the Borough
Council approves demolition of a building, a good-faith effort
shall be made by the owner/applicant to move the building to a
nearby site. If moving a building slated to be demolished is
economically or practically infeasible, best efforts shall be
made to salvage architectural features of the building for use
within the Borough.
C. Unreasonable Economic Hardship.
(1) When a claim of unreasonable economic hardship is made
pursuant to this Part, the owner/applicant must present
credible evidence that, if the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness is denied, the owner/applicant will be unable
to obtain a reasonable return from or a reasonable beneficial
use of the property. The owner/applicant shall submit by
affidavit to the Board the relevant information outlined below,
which shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(a) The date the property was acquired by its current owner.
(b) The price paid for the property (if acquired by purchase)
and a description of the relationship, if any, between the
buyer and seller of the property.
(c) The form of ownership or operation of the property,
whether sole proprietorship, partnership, for-profit or
nonprofit corporation, limited liability company, limited
partnership, joint venture or other.
(d) The mortgage history of the property, including the
current mortgage and the annual debt service, if any, for
the previous two years.
(e) The current market value of the property.
(f) The owner's equity in the property.
(g) An income and expense statement for the current year and
for the past two years.
(h) The capital expenditures made for the benefit of the
property during its ownership by the current owner.
(i) Any appraisals of the property obtained within the
previous two years.
(j) The income and property tax factors affecting the
property.
§ 11-110 FOREWORD § 11-110
FWD:227
(k) All studies commissioned by the applicant/owner as to the
profitable renovation, rehabilitation or utilization of any
structures or objects on the property for alternative use, or
a statement that none were obtained.
(l) Estimate(s) of the cost of the proposed demolition and
estimate(s) of any additional cost(s) that would be incurred
in order to comply with the recommendations of the Board
for changes or conditions necessary for the Board's
recommendation to the Borough Council for the approval
of a certificate of appropriateness.
(2) The Board may require that an applicant/owner furnish
additional information relevant to its determination of
unreasonable economic hardship.
(3) Should the Board determine that the present economic return
of the applicant/owner is not reasonable, it must consider
whether there are other uses currently allowed that would
provide a reasonable economic return and whether such a
return could be obtained through investment in the property
for rehabilitation purposes. The Board may choose to
recommend that special local, state or federal economic and
tax incentives be developed to assist the applicant/owner of the
property in maintaining it and obtaining a suitable economic
return or achieving a reasonable beneficial use.
(4) The Board may seek the assistance of appropriate local,
statewide or national preservation organizations and/or
economic development agencies for solutions or funding,
which may relieve the economic hardship of the applicant/
owner. If the Board chooses to explore such options, the Board
may delay its recommendation for the issuance of a certificate
of appropriateness for demolition based on economic hardship
for a period of up to 90 days in addition to any other applicable
time periods for approval of the project.
(5) Should the applicant/owner satisfy the Board that an
unreasonable economic hardship will result if a certificate of
appropriateness is not approved for demolition, and should the
Board be unable to develop with the Borough or appropriate
local, statewide and national preservation organization and/or
economic development agencies a solution which can relieve
the economic hardship of the applicant/owner, the Board shall
recommend the approval and the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness for demolition.
D. Issuance of Certificate of Appropriateness Permit for Demolition.
(1) Prior to the issuance of any permit for the demolition of a
building or structure in the Historic District, the applicant/
owner shall have obtained all necessary approvals and permits
§ 11-110 GETTYSBURG CODE § 11-110
FWD:228
associated with the project, which shall include, but not be
limited to, zoning approvals or permits; subdivision and land
development approval; any Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
approvals, to include, but not limited to, Department of
Transportation and Department of Labor and Industry
approvals; any Gettysburg Municipal Authority approvals and
the issuance of water and sewer connection/disconnection
permits; and the issuance of building permits for the
construction of new buildings.
(2) Prior to the issuance of any permit for the demolition of a
building in an Historic District, the applicant/owner shall
provide financial security in the form of cash, certified funds,
or an irrevocable letter of credit for the cost of constructing
the proposed new improvements, including any buildings. The
applicant/owner shall enter into an agreement with the
Borough authorizing said financial security and providing for
completion of the improvements within 12 months from the
date of issuance of the permits.
(3) No demolition may occur until all permits necessary for the
project, as well as licenses, zoning or land use permits, or other
necessary documents or approvals, have been obtained or met
and the agreement set forth in § 11-110, Subsection 3D(2)
above, has been executed by all parties.
(4) Vacant structures in the Historic District shall be properly and
adequately secured against the elements and vandalism to
prevent deterioration, and the exterior of the property shall be
maintained in accordance with all applicable ordinances of the
Borough.
(5) The Borough shall have the authority to issue a permit for the
demolition of a building in the Historic District when, in the
opinion of a registered professional engineer with experience
in structural engineering, such building represents an
immediate and present danger to the life or property of any
residents or visitors of the Borough.
(6) A permit for demolition without compliance with this Part may
be issued if the Borough's Building Inspector certifies in
writing that the building represents an immediate and present
danger to public health, safety and welfare and that no other
reasonable alternatives exist other than demolition.
E. Demolition by Neglect.
(1) All buildings within the Historic District shall be maintained in
good repair, structurally sound and reasonably protected
against decay and deterioration, pursuant to the Borough
Property Maintenance Code. Examples of such deterioration
include:
§ 11-110 FOREWORD § 11-110
FWD:229
§ 11-111. Signs. [Ord. 1118-91, 8/12/1991, § 111]
(a) Deterioration of exterior walls and other vertical supports.
(b) Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members.
(c) Deterioration of exterior chimneys.
(d) Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar.
(e) Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or
foundations, including broken windows or doors.
(f) Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous
condition that could lead to the claims that demolition is
necessary for the public safety.
(2) Any unresolved notices of ordinance violations issued to the
property owner may be considered in a determination of
demolition by neglect.
4. In cases where applications include substantial excavation under or
adjacent to an existing building or to an area of the lot previously
undisturbed, thus creating the potential to disturb or destroy
archaeologically important cultural resources, the Board shall, where
deemed necessary, recommend to the Borough Council that the
proposed excavation be postponed for at least 30 days from the date of
the Borough Council's decision. During this period, the Board or
members of its staff shall consult with a State Historic Preservation
Office qualified archaeologist to advise and assist the Board on an
appropriate course of action that will mitigate the potential damage to
the archaeological resource. In instances where the archaeological
resource appears substantial, the Board may seek technical and
financial assistance from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum
Commission and/or other preservation organizations to conduct a
Phase I and/or Phase II archaeological investigation of the site. In this
instance, the Board may recommend to the Borough Council that the
application be delayed for a period not to exceed 75 days from the date
of the Borough Council's decision. If this is the case, the Board will
make every effort to work closely with the applicant to minimize the
inconvenience and delays this may cause.
1. Procedures.
A. No sign or permanent external advertising display of any kind or
for any purpose shall be erected or altered in the Historic District
until an application for a permit to make such erection or alteration
has been reviewed by the Historic Architectural Review Board, a
certificate of appropriateness issued and a sign permit granted,
except that the Code Enforcement Officer may issue permits for
minor sign changes as defined in § 11-104, Subsection 4D, without
referral to the full Board. However, he/she shall keep records of any
§ 11-110 GETTYSBURG CODE § 11-111
FWD:230
permits issued for minor sign changes and shall report these to the
Board at its next meeting for inclusion in the minutes.
B. No sign or permanent external advertising display of any kind shall
be erected, altered or used in the Historic District except for
advertising informing the public of a service, business, occupation
or profession carried on in or about the property on which such
sign or permanent external advertising display appears.
2. Standards.
A. In considering appropriateness of proposed signs, the Board shall
take the following into account: appropriateness to the
architectural style and period of the building at which it will be
located, material composition, shape, colors, overall design, type of
lettering, illustrative material or logo, spacing, lighting,
suspension, accuracy of statements on the sign pertaining to
historical or architectural matters, and compatibility of these
factors with other signs in the Historic District. In addition, the
Board may advise on matters of grammar, spelling and
punctuation, but approval may not be denied on these grounds.
B. No animated, revolving, or moving signs shall be permitted.
C. Illumination of any sign shall be indirect, fully shielded, or
otherwise arranged so that illumination of the sign, rather than the
source of light, is visible from the public right-of-way. Internally
lighted signs are prohibited.
D. No freestanding sign shall be more than nine feet high.
E. Projecting signs extending more than two feet over any public walk
or right-of-way shall be at least eight feet above the walk grade and
at least 14 feet above any vehicular right-of-way.
F. No sign shall be erected at the intersection of any streets in such a
manner as to obstruct free and clear vision or at any location
where, by reason of its position, shape or color, it may interfere
with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized
traffic sign, signal or device.
G. No sign shall be located so as to prevent or hinder free ingress to or
egress from any door, window or fire escape. No sign shall be
attached to a standpipe or fire escape.
H. No sign shall be attached to, or placed on, any public utility pole or
tree located within any public right-of-way.
I. Should the Code Enforcement Officer deem the design of a
temporary sign inappropriate for placement in the Historic District,
he/she may refer the matter to the Board for review and
recommendation to the Borough Council. A time limit for a
temporary sign may be recommended by the Board.

Board's recommendation concerning an application will be considered,
the applicant must be supplied with written notice of the date, time and
place of the Council meeting.
3. If the Board decides to advise against the granting of a certificate of
appropriateness for all or part of an application, it shall indicate to the
applicant, in writing, the changes in plans and specifications, if any,
which, in the opinion of the Board, would protect the distinctive
historical character of the district. If the applicant decides to make the
specified changes, he/she shall so notify the Board, in writing, within
five days following the rendering of its decision. The Board, in turn,
shall advise the Borough Council accordingly. If the applicant is unable

Code Enforcement Officer a certificate of appropriateness authorizing a
permit for work covered by the application. The applicant shall be
advised by the Code Enforcement Officer of the time and place of the
meeting at which his/her application shall be considered. The applicant
shall have the right to attend this meeting and be heard as to the
reasons for filing the said application. In determining whether or not to
certify to the appropriateness of the proposal, the Borough Council
shall consider the same factors that the Board is authorized to consider,
which are set forth in §§ 11-110 and 11-111 of this Part, and shall give
weight to the Board's recommendations.

§ 15-302. Loading and Unloading. [Ord. 1028-85, 8/12/1985; as
amended by Ord. 1376-10, 5/10/2010, § 1]
1. Generally. The loading and unloading of goods, wares and merchandise
from any motor vehicle is hereby restricted to such length of time as is
reasonably necessary for the purpose of loading and unloading of such
goods, wares and merchandise. For the purpose of enforcement of this
section, such loading or unloading of any motor vehicle shall not be
considered as parking; however, except as specifically provided in this
section relative to the loading and unloading of motor vehicles, no
person shall load or unload a motor vehicle from any place upon any
street or alley in the Borough where parking is prohibited or shall allow
a motor vehicle to remain for loading or unloading in any place upon
any street or alley where parking is limited as to time for longer than
the time for which parking is permitted, or shall load or unload upon
any street or alley in such a way that one lane for vehicular traffic shall
not be kept open at all times.
2. Loading and Unloading of Motor Vehicles. Stopping, standing and/or
parking of motor vehicles for the purpose of loading or unloading of
goods, wares and merchandise at commercial, business, office or dining
establishments shall be permitted upon the streets or alleys of the
Borough of Gettysburg where such loading or unloading of goods,
wares and merchandise will serve to minimize congestion in busy areas
of the Borough by leaving open the primary public streets of the
Borough for use by the traveling public. This exception for loading and
unloading of motor vehicles is only where such street or alley provides
ample space for the loading and unloading of goods, wares and
merchandise. Where the primary public street servicing a commercial,
business, office or dining establishment contains adequate available
parking spaces and minimal traffic congestion, the loading or unloading
of goods, wares and merchandise shall be completed from the available
parking spaces on said primary public street. However, it is generally
the policy of the Borough of Gettysburg that the loading and unloading
of goods, wares and merchandise by motor vehicles occur where
reasonably safe and practical in the public alleys to the rear of
properties being serviced by such motor vehicles.

Prohibited in Certain Marked Areas. [Ord. 1028-85, 8/12/1985]
A. Through Traffic. In the event that a motor vehicle utilizes a public
alley of the Borough for the purpose of loading or unloading of
goods, wares and merchandise as an alternative to blocking
parking spaces and traffic flow on the public streets of the
Borough, such motor vehicle shall be permitted to load or unload in
a manner that will block through traffic on narrow alleys of the
Borough for loading and unloading only and only for the amount of
time which is reasonably necessary for loading and/or unloading of
the motor vehicle.
B. State Roads. Loading and unloading of motor vehicles as provided
for in this section is limited to the public streets and alleys of the
Borough of Gettysburg. No stopping, standing and/or parking of
motor vehicles for the purpose of loading or unloading shall be
authorized on state roads or highways except as allowed pursuant
to the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
C. Enforcement. The use of the public streets and alleys of the
Borough for the purpose of loading and/or unloading of motor
vehicles shall be enforced by the Gettysburg Borough Police
Department. As the purpose of this provision is to facilitate the flow
of traffic through the Borough in order to lessen congestion and to
ensure the safety of the traveling public, the Police Department
shall have discretion to balance the needs of a commercial,
business, office or dining establishment in the loading and
unloading of goods, wares and merchandise and the convenience
and safety of the traveling public on the public streets and alleys of
the Borough.
1. Only angle parking shall be permitted on the following portions of the
streets:
Street Between
Lincoln Square All streets
2. On all streets or portions thereof where angle parking is now or shall
hereafter be authorized, all vehicles parked thereon shall be parked
with the front thereof nearest the curb.
1. Wherever a particular parking space shall be lined or marked off on any
street or alley or upon the adjacent curb, every vehicle parked shall be
parked within the lines marking such parking space. All vehicles parked
on streets or alleys, whether parking spaces are marked or not, shall be
parked only in the direction of the permitted traffic flow.

owner of the vehicle. If the error is that of the Borough, appropriate
charges may be assessed against the Borough.
9. Towing companies shall be responsible for the conduct of all of its
drivers and employees. Misconduct of towing company employees may
subject a towing company to the suspension of towing privileges. The
driver's license of a person towing for a towing company is subject to
inspection by the Chief of Police or by any police officer of the Borough.
10. The towing company shall remove all debris from the collision area as
part of the towing service.

The Borough Council of the Borough of Gettysburg finds that:
§ 17-103. Purpose. [Ord. 1402-12, 11/13/2012]
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Gettysburg Borough and its watersheds by minimizing the harm and
maximizing the benefits described in § 17-102 of this chapter, through
provisions designed to:
A. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
B. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood-control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of the people of Gettysburg Borough, their
resources, and the environment.
A. Meet water quality requirements under state law, including regulations
at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of the commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.

B. Twenty percent of existing impervious area within the regulated
activity area, when present, shall be considered meadow in the
model for existing conditions.
C. The developer shall demonstrate that the flows for the one-, two-,
five-, and ten-year-frequency storms peak rates are less than or
equal to pre-development rates during the construction phase.
1. For the purposes of the Act 167 Storm Water Management (plan)
elements and this chapter, design policy pertaining to stormwater
management facilities for Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
§ 17-303 FOREWORD § 17-305
FWD:409
§ 17-306. Design Criteria and Standards. [Ord. 1402-12, 11/13/
2012]
(PennDOT) roadways and associated facilities is provided in Section
13.7 (Antidegradation and Post Construction Stormwater Management
Policy) of PennDOT Publication No. 13M, Design Manual Part 2 (August
2009), as developed, updated, and amended in consultation with the
PDEP. As stated in DM-2.13.7.D (Act 167 and Municipal Ordinances),
PennDOT roadways and associated facilities shall be consistent with
Act 167 plans. DM-2.13.7.B (Policy on Antidegradation and Post-
Construction Stormwater Management) was developed as a
cooperative effort between PennDOT and DEP. DM-2.13.7.C (Project
Categories) discusses the anticipated impact on the quality, volume,
and rate of stormwater runoff.
2. Where standards in the Act 167 ordinance are impractical, PennDOT
may request assistance from DEP, in consultation with the Borough and
County, to develop an alternative strategy for meeting State water
quality requirements and the goals and objectives of the Act 167 plan
elements.
3. For the purposes of the Act 167 ordinance, road maintenance activities
are regulated under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
1. Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas proposed to drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when
determining allowable peak runoff rates; however, on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the
development site. When conditions as described above are
encountered, separate analysis for developed and off-site areas shall be
made for comparison purposes.
2. On-Site Areas. On-site areas proposed to remain outside a regulated
activity area shall be considered as existing conditions, without
considering any reductions in cover type. When conditions as described
above are encountered, separate analysis for these areas shall be made
for comparison purposes.
3. Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis. Any existing downstream
hydraulic capacity analysis shall be conducted in accordance with this
chapter.
A. All downstream facilities impacted by the total site area of the
regulated activity shall be studied to determine if the facility has
adequate capacity to handle existing and proposed flows. An
impacted downstream facility is one to which the runoff from the
total site area of the regulated activity comprises more than 50% of
the total flow to such a facility. The study shall end at a perennial
stream. Downstream facilities include, but are not limited to, manmade
or natural swales and open channels, pipes, inlets, culverts,
bridges and roadways.
§ 17-305 GETTYSBURG CODE § 17-306
FWD:410
B. If any private facility is found to be undersized, the applicant shall
be responsible for updating the facility in coordination with the
regulated activity and appropriate municipal representation.
4. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-by-case basis
using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection
of the downstream watershed areas.
5. Capacity Improvements of Local Drainage Networks. In certain
instances, local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels
of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire
watershed. In these instances, if the developer can prove that it would
be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity
deficiency in the local drainage network, then the capacity
improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff
controls on the development site. Any capacity improvements would be
designed based upon development of all areas tributary to the proposed
improvement and the capacity criteria specified in this chapter. In
addition, all new development upstream of a proposed capacity
improvement shall be assumed to implement the applicable runoff
controls consistent with this chapter, except that all new development
within the entire subarea(s) within which the proposed development
site is located shall be assumed to implement the developer's proposed
discharge control, if any.
6. Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to implement any
regional or subregional detention alternatives.
7. Where the potential for groundwater and/or surface water
contamination exists, based on the proposed use of the regulated
activity, safeguards shall be incorporated into the site.
A. For industrial or commercial sites where it is possible that toxic or
hazardous substances may come into contact with stormwater
runoff, pretreatment of the first-flush (first 1/2 inch) runoff over
areas where industrial and commercial operations take place shall
be provided. Pretreatment shall include means for separating light
and heavy toxic and hazardous substances from the stormwater
before the stormwater is conveyed to the general stormwater
management facilities.
B. Infiltration systems may be used to handle runoff from commercial
or industrial working or parking areas only after the first-flush
§ 17-306 FOREWORD § 17-306
FWD:411
stormwater from these areas has been pretreated for removal of
toxic and hazardous substances.
8. Roof drains and sump pumps shall discharge to lawns, infiltration or
vegetative BMPs, or pervious areas wherever/whenever possible. If the
above discharge criteria cannot be met or when it is more
advantageous to connect directly to streets, storm sewers or other
stabilized conveyance designations, then the discharge will be
permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Borough. All discharges shall
be conveyed in a manner as to not cause water problems on adjoining
property owners.
9. Subsurface detention facilities shall provide adequately designed
pretreatment for removal of pollutants, oil, trash and debris.
Appropriate supporting information shall be provided for all proposed
devices. All subsurface facilities shall be designed such that access for
inspection and cleaning of the facility can occur.
10. Inlets shall be placed on both sides of the street at low spots and at the
upper side of street intersections to prevent stormwater from crossing
an intersection. Other devices such as high-efficiency grates or
perforated pipe may be required if conditions warrant. All inlets at low
points along the roadway shall have a ten-inch curb reveal and shall be
equipped with pavement base drain extending 50 feet in either
direction, parallel to the center line of the roadway.
11. Manholes, inlets, headwalls, and endwalls shall conform to the
requirements of PennDOT Publication 408, as modified by the adopted
Borough standards.
12. Design Standards. Permanent detention and retention facilities shall be
designed to meet the following standards:
A. The maximum permitted depth for dry detention or retention
basins shall be six feet, measured from the bottom of the
emergency spillway to the lowest point in the basin.
B. The minimum top width of all basin embankments shall be eight
feet.
C. The maximum permitted side slopes for detention or retention
basins shall be four horizontal to one vertical. In order to obtain a
waiver for slopes steeper than 4:1, the plan must include a planting
schedule to stabilize the embankments. The proposed vegetation
shall be low-maintenance varieties.
D. Minimum Bottom Slope. All detention basins shall have a minimum
bottom slope of 2% unless infiltration facilities are provided.
E. Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen
embankment required or regulated by this chapter shall be
§ 17-306 GETTYSBURG CODE § 17-306
FWD:412
designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to
and including the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour design storm
at post-development conditions, assuming the principal outlet
structure to be clogged. The height of embankment must be set as
to provide a minimum one foot of freeboard above the maximum
elevation computed for the clogged orifice condition. Should any
stormwater management facility require a dam safety permit under
25 Pa. Code Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 and meet the regulations
of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may be
required to pass storms larger than the one-hundred-year event.
F. A cutoff trench of impervious material shall be provided within all
basin embankments.
G. Where a basin embankment is constructed using fill on an existing
fifteen-percent or greater slope, the basin must be keyed into the
existing grade.
H. Fencing. Any aboveground stormwater management detention/
retention facility that is designed to store at least a two-foot depth
of runoff shall be subject to the following fencing requirements:
(1) A stormwater facility must be completely surrounded by a
chain-link fence of not less than four feet in height. Alternative
fences and barriers may be permitted upon request to and
approval by the Borough.
(2) All gates or doors opening through such enclosure shall be
equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device for
keeping the gate or door securely closed at all times, when not
in actual use.
I. All outlet structures and emergency spillways shall include a
satisfactory means of energy dissipation at its outlet to assure
conveyance and flow without endangering the safety and integrity
of the basin and the downstream drainage area.
J. A concentrated discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property
shall be within a natural drainageway or watercourse, or an
easement shall be required.
K. All facilities shall be provided with an access slope at no more than
5:1 along with an access easement.
L. Plans for infiltration must show the locations of existing and
proposed septic tank infiltration areas and wells. A minimum of 10
feet separation from on-lot disposal systems (OLDS) infiltration
areas, including replacement areas, is required; however, 25 feet is
desirable. Infiltration rates shall be based upon perc and probe
tests conducted at the site of the proposed facility.
§ 17-306 FOREWORD § 17-306
FWD:413
M. Guards shall be provided on all intake and outfall structures as well
as outlet structures. The guard bars shall be one-half-inch-diameter
galvanized bars on six-inch centers attached to the structure with
three-eights-inch-diameter stainless steel anchors.
N. All facilities shall specify a maintenance requirement that controls
the growth of noxious and invasive plants as specified in Appendix
B, which is attached hereto and made a part of this chapter.
13. All storage facilities shall completely drain both the volume control and
rate control capacities over a period of time not less than 24 hours and
not more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm. However, any
designed infiltration at such facilities is exempt from the minimum
twenty-four-hour standard, i.e., may infiltrate in a shorter period of
time, so long as none of the stormwater flowing into the infiltration
facility is discharged directly into the surface waters of the
commonwealth. (Inordinately rapid infiltration rates may indicate the
presence of large fractures or other conditions for which an additional
soil buffer may be required.) Where extended detention facilities are
utilized to mitigate increased volume, the increased volume is required
to be detained not less than 24 hours from the end of the twenty-fourhour
design storm (assuming the peak rate occurs at approximately the
twelve-hour time period in the storm).
14. For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and
requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under Title
25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean Streams Law, and the Storm
Water Management Act.
15. Design for BMPs shall be in accordance with design standards as listed
in the BMP Manual or other legitimate source.
16. Existing (pre-development) pervious areas must be considered meadow
within the regulated area, unless the existing land use dictates a lower
runoff condition.
17. Infiltration BMPs shall be spread out such that impervious to BMP
loading ratios are less than or equal to 5:1, made as shallow as
practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration
features while still meeting the other requirements of this chapter.
18. Impervious Area.
A. The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development, even if
development is to take place in phases.
B. For development taking place in phases, the total proposed
impervious for all phases must be used in determining
conformance with this chapter.

FWD:414
§ 17-307. Regulations Governing Stormwater Management
Facilities. [Ord. 1402-12, 11/13/2012]
C. For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
chapter, except that the volume controls in § 17-303 and the peak
rate controls of § 17-304 do not need to be considered for existing
impervious areas that are not being altered by the proposed
regulated activity.
D. Twenty percent of existing impervious area within the regulated
area, when present, shall be considered meadow in the model for
existing conditions.
19. Infiltration BMPs shall be designed in the following manner: A detailed
soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to determine the
suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be performed by a
qualified professional and, at a minimum, address soil permeability,
depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and subgrade
stability, seasonally high groundwater table, suitability of stormwater
management facilities and maximum infiltration capacity in depth of
water per unit area. The general process for designing the infiltration
BMP shall be:
A. Site evaluation to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices.
B. Provide field tests throughout the area proposed for development
to determine appropriate percolation rate and/or hydraulic
conductivity. At least one infiltration test must be included in each
soil group, and at least one infiltration test must be conducted for
each five lots proposed for development. Infiltration tests must be
taken at the location and depth of all proposed infiltration
structures.
C. Design infiltration facility for required storm volume based on all
available data.
D. The infiltration requirement in the high-quality/exceptional waters
shall be subject to Title 25, Chapter 93, of the Pennsylvania Code of
Regulations and the antidegradation regulations promulgated by
DEP thereunder.
E. A double-ring infiltrometer test shall be used for all infiltration
tests in accordance with the current edition of the BMP Manual.
20. Plans for infiltration must show the locations of existing and proposed
septic tank infiltration areas and wells. A minimum twenty-five-foot
separation from on-lot disposal systems (OLDS) infiltration areas,
including replacement areas, is desired and will be evaluated by the
municipality on a case-by-case basis. However, the separation shall not
be less than DEP-required 10 feet.
§ 17-306 FOREWORD § 17-307
FWD:415
1. Any stormwater facility located on State highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
2. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth or
wetlands shall be subject to approval by DEP through the joint permit
application process or, where deemed appropriate by DEP, the general
permit process. When there is a question whether wetlands may be
involved, it is the responsibility of the developer or his agent to show
that the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands, otherwise
approval to work in the area must be obtained from DEP.
3. Any stormwater management facility located within the vicinity of a
floodplain shall be subject to approval in accordance with 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 106 (Floodplain Management) of the rules and regulations
promulgated by DEP.
4. All earthmoving activities must be reviewed and approved by the
Adams County Conservation District prior to commencing work.
5. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
good engineering principles and practices. The Borough shall reserve
the right to disapprove any design that would result in the occupancy or
continuation of adverse hydrologic or hydraulic conditions within the
watershed.
6. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without written permission of the
adjacent property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
7. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. If
diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer shall document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
8. Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also,
the maintaining of vegetation in a natural state within the easement
shall be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.

FWD:416
§ 17-308. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. 1402-12, 11/13/2012]
9. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
conveyance facilities on the site cannot adequately provide for
drainage, open channels may be constructed conforming substantially
to the line and grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural
conveyance facilities shall be subject to approval by DEP through the
joint permit application process or, where deemed appropriate by DEP,
through the general permit process.
10. Special Requirements for Areas Falling Within Defined Exceptional
Value and High-Quality Subwatersheds: The temperature and quality of
water and streams that have been declared as exceptional value and
high quality are to be maintained as defined in Chapter 93, Water
Quality Standards, Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code of Regulations.
Temperature-sensitive BMPs and stormwater conveyance systems are
to be used and designed with storage pool areas and supply outflow
channels and should be shaded with trees. This will require
modification of berms for permanent ponds and the relaxation of
restrictions on planting vegetation within the facilities, provided that
capacity for volumes and rate control is maintained. At a minimum, the
southern half on pond shorelines shall be planted with shade or canopy
trees within 10 feet of the pond shoreline. In conjunction with this
requirement, the maximum slope allowed on the berm area to be
planted is 10 to 1. This will lessen the destabilization of berm soils due
to root growth. A long-term maintenance schedule and management
plan for the thermal control BMPs is to be established and recorded for
all development sites within defined exceptional value and/or highquality
subwatersheds.
1. Stormwater runoff hydrographs/peak rates shall be calculated in the
following manner:
A. For the purpose of considering peak flows with a fully developed
runoff hydrograph, the Soil Cover Complex Method TR-20 or TR-55
and a twenty-four-hour rainfall event shall be used with the
appropriate design rainfall depths. A dynamic or interconnected
model is required for modeling of multiple drainage or subareas.
The SCS Rainfall Type II curve or local precipitation frequency data
shall be used for the rainfall distribution. The Borough may allow
the use of other methodologies on a case-by-case basis as approved
prior to design submittal.
B. Times of concentration shall be calculated using the methodology
presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by NRCS).
C. The design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge shall be obtained from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas
of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, as amended
and updated, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and
§ 17-307 FOREWORD § 17-308
FWD:417
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service,
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring,
Maryland. NOAA's Atlas 14 can be accessed at:
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
D. Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed
conditions to be used in the Soil Cover Complex method shall be
obtained from Appendix C, Table 1, which is attached hereto and
made a part of this chapter.
E. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by
routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities, using
either manual methods or computerized routing. Routing shall be
based upon the Modified Puls Method; other routing methodologies
shall be subject to the approval of the Borough Engineer.
2. Conveyance facilities shall be designed in the following manner:
A. All storm drain systems, streets, and inlets (excluding detention
and retention basin outfall structures) shall be designed for a tenyear
storm event. Sole-access structures (culverts and bridges)
shall be designed to convey the twenty-five-year flood without
overtopping the roadway.
(1) When a pipe or culvert is intended to convey to or pass the
discharge from a stormwater management facility, its required
capacity shall be computed using the methodology considered
for the stormwater management facility design as part of a
dynamic model.
(2) Greater design frequencies may be justified on individual
projects.
(3) A one-hundred-year storm frequency may be required for
design of the stormwater collection system to insure that the
resultant stormwater runoff from the post-development storm
is directed into the management facility.
(4) If the Rational Method is used for calculating peak flows,
conveyance facilities 30 inches in diameter or less shall use a
time of concentration of five minutes for the contributing
drainage area shall be considered for the design.
B. In general, inlets shall be spaced such that, based upon the
Rational Method, time of concentration (tc) equals five-minute and
ten-year rainfall intensity; the area contributing to the inlet shall
not produce a peak runoff of greater than four cubic feet per
second (cfs). Also, inlets shall be spaced so that their efficiency,
based upon efficiency curves published by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation (PennDOT), is not less than 65%.

§ 17-309. Carbonate Geology. [Ord. 1402-12, 11/13/2012]
In areas of carbonate geology, a geologist shall certify to the following:
C. The Rational Method may be used for stormwater collection and
conveyance facilities, provided that the facilities are part of an
integrated SWM facility requiring modeling using SCS modeling.
Rainfall intensities shall be consistent with appropriate times of
concentration and return periods.
D. Runoff coefficients (C) for use with the Rational Method shall be
obtained from Appendix C, Table 2, which is attached hereto and
made a part of this chapter.
E. Existing and proposed channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a proposed one-hundred-year
return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with
protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall
be based upon criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual.
F. Existing natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to
convey proposed one-hundred-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
G. Stormwater runoff on roadways (i.e., gutter spread, lane
encroachment, etc.) shall be controlled in accordance with
PennDOT Publications 13M, "Design Manual, Part 2," and 584,
"Drainage Manual."
H. In all cases where drainage is picked up by means of a headwall,
the pipe shall be designed as a culvert. Inlet and outlet conditions
shall be analyzed. The minimum diameter of a culvert shall be 18
inches. The procedure contained in Hydraulic Engineer Circulars
No. 5 and No. 13, as prepared by the U.S. Department of
Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Washington,
D.C., shall be used for the design of culverts. All culverts shall
include concrete headwalls and endwalls.
A. No stormwater management facility will be placed in, over, or
immediately adjacent to the following features:
(1) Closer than 100 feet from sinkholes;
(2) Closer than 100 feet from closed depressions;
(3) Closer than 100 feet from caverns, intermittent lakes, or ephemeral
streams;
(4) Closer than 50 feet from lineaments in carbonate areas;
(5) Closer than 50 feet from fracture traces; or

§ 17-310. Riparian Buffers/Riparian Forest Buffers. [Ord. 1402-12,
11/13/2012]
Where an applicant proposes to utilize riparian buffers as the means to meet
the requirements of this chapter, said riparian buffers shall be established
and/or maintained in accordance with the BMP Manual or the publication
Riparian Forest Buffer Guidance, published November 2010 by DEP, and as
may be amended or updated.
§ 17-311. Prohibited Discharges and Connections. [Ord. 1402-12,
11/13/2012]
(6) Closer than 25 feet from bedrock pinnacles (surface or subsurface).
B. Stormwater resulting from regulated activities shall not be discharged
into sinkholes.
C. If the developer can prove through analysis that the project site is an
area underlain by carbonate geology, and such geologic conditions may
result in sinkhole formations, then the project site is exempt from
recharge requirements as described in § 17-303, Volume Controls.
However, the project site shall still be required to meet all other
standards found in this chapter.
D. It shall be the developer's responsibility to verify if the project site is
underlain by carbonate geology. The following note shall be attached to
all stormwater management plans and signed and sealed by the
developer's geologist: "I, __________, certify that the proposed
stormwater management facility (circle one) is/is not underlain by
carbonate geology."
E. Whenever a stormwater management facility will be located in an area
underlain by carbonate geology, a geological evaluation of the proposed
location by a qualified licensed professional shall be conducted to
determine susceptibility to sinkhole formation and the possibility of
groundwater contamination from the facility.
1. Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, that
allows any nonstormwater discharge, including sewage, process
wastewater, and wash water, to enter the waters of the commonwealth
is prohibited.
2. No person shall allow, or cause to allow, discharges into surface waters
of the commonwealth which are not composed entirely of stormwater,
except 1) as provided in Subsection 17-311.3 below and 2) discharges
allowed under a state or federal permit.
3. The following discharges are authorized unless they are determined to
be significant contributors to pollution to the waters of the
commonwealth:

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT (SWM) SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS
§ 17-401. SWM Site Plan Submission. [Ord. 1402-12, 11/13/2012]
§ 17-402. SWM Site Plan and Narrative Requirements. [Ord.
1402-12, 11/13/2012]
1. When a property owner or developer proposes a regulated activity, said
property owner or developer shall submit an SWM site plan to
demonstrate compliance with the stormwater management provisions
of this chapter. Said submission shall be required by the Borough unless
said regulated activity is exempted from SWM site plan submission in
accordance with the exemption criteria and exemption approval
process established in § 17-302 of this chapter. Where the Borough
determines that the property owner or developer proposing the
regulated activity is eligible to employ the process established in the
Simplified Approach (see Appendix D, which is attached hereto and
made a part of this chapter) to address the stormwater management
needs of a site, the submission of the required documentation from said
manual shall substitute for the SWM site plan requirements of this Part.
2. Copies of the SWM site plan shall be distributed as follows:
A. Two copies to the Borough;
B. One copy to the Borough Engineer, when applicable;
C. One copy to the Adams County Conservation District (if an NPDES
permit is required); and
D. One copy to the Adams County Office of Planning and Development
(only if submitted as a component of a subdivision and land
development plan in accordance with the Gettysburg Borough
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance).
3. Additional copies shall be submitted as requested by the Borough.

and clearance before entry into the premises, the discharger shall
make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the Borough,
its representatives, agents or contractors.
B. Facility operators shall allow the Borough ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater and the

removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the
Borough and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the operator.
F. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Borough access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
Part. An operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the Borough is denied reasonable access to the permitted facility
for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required
by this Part.
G. If the Borough has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and the Borough's
representative is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this Part, or that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this Part or any order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency

previously submitted plan, the Commission may require the
applicant to submit additional fees if needed based upon the
Borough's expenditures on the review up to that time.

development plan, then such revision shall be considered a
new submittal, and the ninety-day maximum time period
for Commission approval shall re-start after the first

simplified requirements and procedures of § 704.
1. The regulations set forth in this Chapter may, from time to time, be
amended by Borough Council, following the procedures of the

Part 3
OVERVIEW OF GENERAL PROCEDURES
§ 22-301. Purpose. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/10/1999, § 301]
This Part summarizes the general procedures for the submission and review
of proposed subdivisions and land developments. This Part is only a general
explanation and is not binding on the Borough or an applicant. See the
actual provisions of the other Parts of this Chapter. Two flowcharts are
included at the end of this Part to show the general process for major and
minor subdivisions.
§ 22-302. General Procedure for Subdivisions and Land
Developments. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/10/1999, § 302]
1. Review and Approval Stages. Three types of plan submissions are
established: sketch, preliminary and final, as outlined below.

* See definitions in Part 2.
** See Part 7 for minor subdivision final plan submission and review
requirements. See § 22-705 for submission requirements for a lot line
adjustment.
*** At their option, the Commission may grant combined preliminary/final plan
approval if the preliminary plan submission meets the requirements of a
final plan submission and if the Commission determines that there are no
outstanding matters.
**** Except where exempted by § 22-502.
2. Sketch Plan. While a sketch plan is not required, it is strongly
recommended that it be filed to allow the applicant to consult early and
informally with the Planning Commission before preparing a
§ 22-301 FOREWORD § 22-302
FWD:555
§ 22-303. General Plan Submission Procedures. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/
10/1999, § 303]
preliminary plan. This will often avoid expensive redesign and delay to
the applicant.
3. Preliminary Plan. Preliminary plans are required to be submitted for
any major subdivision and for certain land developments, as described
above.
4. Final Plan. After approval of the preliminary plan of a major subdivision
or certain land developments, the applicant files a final plan. A final
plan must be approved prior to recording of the plans by the County
and prior to the sale of any lots or the construction of any buildings (see
Part 9).
5. Guarantee of Improvements Installation. Where improvements are
required by this Chapter, in most cases, the Borough will require that
the applicant enter into a development agreement, including the
posting of financial security sufficient to guarantee the costs of any
improvements which may be required. See Part 8.
1. Submission. Sketch, preliminary and final plans and all required
accompanying information are required to be submitted to the plans
administrator by delivery by person.
2. Completeness. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to
reject or to table an application that it determines is significantly
incomplete.
3. Attendance. The applicant or his/her duly authorized representative
should endeavor to attend the Commission meeting to discuss the filed
plans. The Commission may request such attendance. If the applicant
fails to appear when so requested at a meeting where the plans will be
considered it may result in plan disapproval if the Borough determines
that it resulted in insufficient information to render a decision.
4. Action by the Commission. The Commission is required to act upon a
preliminary or final plan within 90 days after the first regular meeting
of the Commission that follows an acceptable submission by the
applicant, unless the applicant grants a time extension.
§ 22-302 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-303
FWD:556
Part 4
SKETCH PLAN
§ 22-401. Preplan Consultation. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/10/1999, § 401]
Prior to submitting a sketch plan, applicants for larger developments are
encouraged to informally discuss their proposal with the plans
administrator and/or other appropriate Borough staff and the Adams County
Office of Planning and Development (ACOPD) staff.
§ 22-402. Sketch Plan Submission Requirements. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/
12/1999, § 402]
Prior to the submission of a preliminary plan, applicants are very strongly
encouraged to submit a sketch plan. A sketch plan review often allows
an applicant to save substantial time and engineering costs because many
concerns about layout and issues concerning Borough ordinances can be
resolved prior to detailed engineering. This can often reduce the need
for future redesign at a more detailed stage, thereby saving the applicant
significant money and time. When submitted, sketch plans shall include the
following information:
A. Submission Requirement. If submitted, seven print copies of the sketch
plan and the accompanying application shall be submitted to the plans
administrator at least seven days prior to a regular Borough Planning
Commission meeting.
B. Drawing Requirements. The sketch plan shall be drafted to
approximate scale and is recommended to include the following as
applicable:
(1) Boundary line of the development.
(2) Significant physical features (such as areas of steep slopes 15%
and greater, quarries, creeks and major drainage channels).
(3) Proposed lot and street layout with approximate areas of lots (such
as 8,000 square feet), including all alleys, driveways and
pedestrian walkways.
(4) Site data including:
(a) Acreage of the entire tract.
(b) Number of lots and types of dwelling units (if residential).
(c) Zoning district and major applicable lot area and setback
requirements.
(5) North point and scale and a tentative name of the project (may be
the developer's name).

dedicate common open space or fees in lieu of land, if required.
(11) Note stating the general methods of providing water and sewer
service, including sufficient information to show the general
feasibility of any proposed nonpublic central sewer service.
(12) Names of any adjacent nonresidential uses and any zoning district
boundaries in the area.
(13)Name and address of person responsible for the preparation of the
plan and the date of preparation.

(15) Statement of the proposed uses of the land (if known).
(16) Plans should be of a standard size, such as 18 inches by 24 inches
or 24 inches by 36 inches.
1. No official action shall be taken on a sketch plan. The Borough shall not
be bound by comments made or not made as part of a sketch plan
review.
2. The Borough shall distribute copies of the sketch plan to the Borough
Engineer, the relevant Borough staff person and the Planning
Commission for advisory reviews.
3. The sketch plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission, with
any comments reported to the applicant or his/her representative.
4. County Planning Commission Review. If the Planning Commission
determines that a subdivision or land development would be expected
to have significant regional impact, the Borough shall submit one copy
of the sketch plan to the County Planning Commission to request an
informal review.
§ 22-402 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-403
FWD:558
5. If the sketch plan would involve land along a creek or river or more than
five dwelling units, or be adjacent to an existing Borough park, then a
copy of the plan should be provided to any Borough Park and
Recreation Commission that may exist for a review of whether open
space or recreation fees should be required.

1999, § 702; as amended by Ord. 1325, 11/13/2006, § 3]
The following submission and review process shall apply for minor
subdivisions, lot line adjustments, annexations, land developments involving
only a single nonresidential building and what the Borough determines to
be minor revisions of approved plans.
1. Final Plan Submission Required. A final plan submission for each minor
subdivision or lot line adjustment must be filed by the applicant and
reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this Part. A preliminary
plan is not required for a minor subdivision, a lot line adjustment or a
land development involving only a single nonresidential building.
2. Required Submission.
A. The applicant shall file to the plans administrator, at least 14 days
prior to a regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting, the
required fee(s) and required number of copies of required plans
and materials (see § 22-703).
B. If a State road is involved, the applicant shall forward the required
information to PennDOT and apply for a highway occupancy
permit. If such permit is not granted prior to final plan approval,
then it shall automatically be a condition of final plan approval and
the plans shall not be recorded until it is granted.
C. Each final plan filed for minor subdivisions shall provide the
information required by § 22-703. Plans for lot line adjustments
shall provide the information required by § 22-704.
D. The applicant shall provide a copy of the plans for review to the
County Planning Commission. A soil erosion and sedimentation
control plan shall be provided to the County Conservation District.

at least one copy of the application form; (ii) at least one copy of the
final plan checklist; (iii) several copies of the final plan; and (iv) at
least one copy of the supporting documents.
4. Determination of Completeness by Commission.
A. Based upon the initial review of the plans administrator and/or the
Borough Engineer, the Commission shall have authority, at its first
regularly scheduled meeting after the submission is filed in a timely
fashion, to determine that a submission is significantly incomplete
and therefore to refuse to review the submission further and to do
one of the following:
(1) Not accept the submission, indicating the deficiencies, and
return the fee (minus the costs of any Borough review) to the
applicant.
(2) Accept the submission as being filed for review on the
condition that the applicant shall file such additional required
materials and information to the staff or appropriate agency or
person within a certain number of days from the date of such
acceptance.
(3) Table the acceptance of the submission until the next Planning
Commission meeting where the applicant has met all of the
submittal requirements and has filed such materials within the
required time period prior to the meeting. The ninety day time
limit for action shall not begin until such acceptance.
(4) Reject the submission for just cause.
B. If the Commission determines that the submission is significantly
complete, as filed and as required, the Commission shall accept the
plans and may begin its review.
C. Zoning Variances.
(1) An application under this Chapter shall not be considered to be
complete if one or more zoning variances will be required for
the subdivision or land development to legally occur as
submitted, until such time as the needed zoning variances have
been granted.
(2) When a lot which is improved with existing single-family
semidetached dwellings is the subject of a subdivision
application for the purpose of enabling single-family
residential development and usage on the subdivided lot or
lots, the applicant shall not be required to meet the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance relative to dimensional
lot requirements. All other requirements of this Part shall apply
§ 22-702 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-702
FWD:598
to the development of the subdivided lot or lots and shall be
enforced.
(3) When a lot which is improved with existing single-family
attached dwellings is the subject of a subdivision application

or developer, Borough Council is hereby granted the power to elect
§ 22-805 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-806
FWD:612
§ 22-807. Maintenance Guarantee. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/12/1999, § 807]

and other public improvements reasonably at the same time or
prior to the construction of the buildings served by those streets or
public improvements, and at the same rate in time at which

cause for default of the security.
2. Completion by Borough. If the proceeds of such security are insufficient
to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, Borough Council may, at its
option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable
action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of
the improvements.
3. Proceeds for Installation of Improvements. The proceeds from use of
the security and/or from any legal or equitable action brought against
the developer shall be used solely for the installation of the
improvements covered by such security.
1. Maintenance Guarantee Required. All applicants proposing any
subdivision or land development which provides for the dedication of
improvements required by this Chapter shall be required to provide a
legally binding maintenance guarantee to the Borough prior to
acceptance of dedication of the improvements by the Borough. In most
cases, this guarantee will be part of the security agreement.
2. Terms of Maintenance Guarantee. The maintenance guarantee shall be
acceptable in legal form to the Borough Solicitor and in content to
Borough Council, and shall include all of the following:
A. That the applicant make any repair or reconstruction of any
improvement stipulated in the maintenance agreement which is
specified by Borough Council if needed because of faulty
construction, workmanship or materials, prior to acceptance of
such improvement by the Borough.
B. That the applicant maintain at his/her own cost all improvements
stipulated in the maintenance agreement, up to a maximum period
of 18 months from the date of dedication and acceptance, except
for any special purpose escrow or maintenance agreements
required by the Borough.
§ 22-806 FOREWORD § 22-807
FWD:613
C. That the applicant post financial security to secure structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plan, for a maximum term of 18 months from
the date of completion.
D. That the developer plow snow and maintain all streets until such
time as the Borough may accept such streets.
3. Public Utilities and Authorities. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines,
or both and related apparatus or facilities are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and under the rules and regulations of a public utility or
municipal authority, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the regulations
of the controlling public utility or municipal authority. This amount of
financial security shall not also be required by the Borough if it is
required by such utility or authority.
4. Type of Security. The maintenance guarantee shall be secured by the
same form of security as is permitted for the improvements guarantees.
5. Terms. Such maintenance guarantee shall be in the form approved by
the Borough Solicitor and Borough Council, payable to the Borough, to
guarantee the maintenance and repair of the streets and other public
improvements in the subdivision or land development for 18 months
from the date of completion. The applicant shall prove to the
satisfaction of Borough Council that there will be an acceptable system
for the long-term maintenance of any stormwater detention basins.
6. Amount. The amount of the maintenance guarantee shall be determined
by the applicant's engineer, conditioned upon acceptance by Borough
Council, but shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of
such improvements.
7. Release. After a maximum of 18 months from the date of completion of
said improvements, the Borough shall release the maintenance
guarantee to the developer (or party that posted the guarantee) if all
improvements are in satisfactory condition, as determined by the
Borough.

DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
§ 22-1001. Application. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/12/1999, § 1001]
§ 22-1002. Required Improvements. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/12/1999,
§ 1002]
This Part sets forth the design and construction standards for required
improvements, regardless of whether the improvement will be dedicated to
the Borough.
§ 22-1003. Overall Requirements. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/12/1999, § 1003]
1. Minimum Requirements. The design standards and improvements
required in this Part are the minimum requirements for approval of a
subdivision or land development. Additional or higher type
improvements may be required in specific cases where the Commission
determines such improvements are clearly necessary to protect the
public health and safety and to meet the development and conservation
goals set forth within the Gettysburg Borough Comprehensive Plan and
Gettysburg Borough Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].
2. Modifications and Exceptions. See § 22-107 of this Chapter.
1. Land shall be suitable for the purpose for which it is to be subdivided or
developed.
2. Hazardous Conditions. Subdivisions or land developments subject to
hazardous conditions (such as open quarries, hazardous or toxic site
pollution, limestone solution channels, unconsolidated fill, floods,
excessive erosion or unsafe water supply) shall not be approved until
the developer has provided or has legally committed to provide
adequate measures to overcome or eliminate the hazards, in the
determination of the Commission, to the best of their knowledge. See
the floodplain requirements of the Borough. However, the Borough
accepts no responsibility to identify hazards or to guarantee their
resolution. See § 22-115, "Liability," in Part 1.
3. Zoning. All aspects of a proposed subdivision or land development shall
conform to the Borough Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27] and all other
Borough ordinances and specifications.
4. Nearby Development. A subdivision or land development and its street
pattern shall be coordinated with existing or approved nearby
developments or neighborhoods to help develop the area harmoniously
in terms of existing development types and forms, colors, materials and
setback lines and building massing and to help prevent conflicts
between neighboring development.
§ 22-1001 FOREWORD § 22-1003
FWD:617
§ 22-1004. Streets. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/12/1999, § 1004]
5. Safety. No subdivision or land development shall occur in such a way
that would significantly threaten the public health and safety, including
hazards of toxic substances, traffic hazards, explosive hazards and fire
hazards.
1. Access to Streets.
A. All proposed subdivisions and land developments shall have
adequate and safe access to the public street system.
B. Frontage. Any lot created under this Chapter shall have frontage
and access onto either:
(1) A public street (which may be required to be improved as
necessary under § 22-1004(13)).
(2) A private street constructed to the same standards as a public
street and that has a permanent system to ensure adequate
maintenance, except as provided in § 22-1004(1)(C), below.
C. Parking Courts. If individual units of an office park, townhouse,
garden apartment, infill development, individual buildings with a
mixture of uses, developments with a mixture of dwelling types or
mobile home park development have vehicular access onto a
private parking court, that parking court is not required to meet
Borough construction standards for streets; provided, that:
(1) The parking court and related accessways have vehicular
access onto a public street.
(2) That there be a system to ensure maintenance of the parking
court that is acceptable to the Commission, except that such
system is not required if the entire development would have a
single owner (such as rental apartments).
2. Streets and Topography. Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the
contour of the land to produce usable lots and reasonably sloped
streets. Where possible, a continuation of the historic grid network of
streets shall be followed.
3. Street Continuations.
A. Stub Streets. Where deemed necessary by the Commission for
efficient movement of traffic, a subdivision or land development
shall include the extension of a proposed street with right-of-way to
the boundary line of the tract to provide for an eventual extension
into the adjacent tract for efficient circulation of traffic throughout
the area.
B. Widening. Where a subdivision or land development abuts or
contains an existing street of inadequate cartway or right-of-way
§ 22-1003 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-1004
FWD:618
width, additional right-of-way and/or cartway width shall be
required conforming with Table 10.1, "Design Standards for
Streets."
4. Intersections.
A. The centerlines of streets shall intersect at right angles, except
where the Commission determines that a right angle intersection is
not feasible. In such case, the intersection shall be at as nearly a
right angle as possible, with an absolute minimum angle of 75°.
B. Alignment of street intersections.
(1) No more than two streets shall intersect at one point.
(2) Where a proposed street or business driveway intersects an
existing cross street, such proposed street or business
driveway shall be aligned with any street intersecting on the
other side of the cross street, unless the Commission or
PennDOT determine that such alignment is not reasonable or
feasible.
(3) If a proposed street cannot intersect at the same location as a
street on the other side of the cross street, then a minimum
distance of at least 150 feet shall be provided between the two
intersecting streets.
C. At street intersections, cartways shall be rounded by arcs with the
radii of 10 feet. For arterial streets, the Commission may require a
larger radius, if recommended by the Borough Engineer.
5. Arterial and Collector Street Frontage. Where a subdivision or land
development abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial or
collector street, the Commission shall require one or more of the
following methods of layout and site design if it determines one or more
of these methods will be reasonable, feasible and necessary to avoid
increased traffic congestion and improve traffic safety. The
Commission's decision to use one or more of the following methods will
be based on its review, recommendations of the Borough Engineer, any
comments from PennDOT and any professional traffic studies that have
been submitted.
A. The use of a marginal access or "frontage" street or access only
onto side or interior streets, to collect traffic from numerous
driveways and direct it to a select few number of entrances to the
arterial or collector street.
B. The minimization of the number and length of driveway cuts or
street intersections onto an arterial or collector street, which may
include requiring the use of shared driveways between adjacent
uses or lots.
§ 22-1004 FOREWORD § 22-1004
FWD:619
C. The restriction of ingress and egress involving left-hand turns onto
or off of the arterial or collector street.
D. The prohibition of driveways from individual dwellings entering
directly onto an arterial or collector street. If there is no alternative
to this, each driveway entering onto an arterial or collector street
shall have adequate turn-around space for vehicles provided within
the lot so that vehicles do not back onto the street.
6. Street Design Standards.
A. Minimum street design standards shall be as shown in Table 10.1.,
unless PennDOT establishes a more restrictive requirement.

a leveling area not greater than 4% grade for a distance of 25 feet,
measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
E. The minimum grade of any street gutter shall be 1%.
F. A minimum tangent of 100 feet, measured from edge of cartway,
shall be required between a curve and a street intersection where
one of the intersecting streets is a collector or an arterial street.
7. Easements. See § 22-1011.
8. Clear Sight Triangle.
§ 22-1004 FOREWORD § 22-1004
FWD:621
A. At any intersection with a street of another street(s) or an
accessway or driveway serving two or more nonresidential
principal uses, a clear sight triangle shall be provided. Such
triangle shall be graded, cleared and kept clear of sight
obstructions (other than official street sign posts and individual
canopy tree trunks) for a height between two and 10 feet above the
ground level.
B. Such clear sight triangle shall be protected by a permanent deed
restriction, covenant stated on the record plan, municipal
easement or other legally binding method acceptable to the
Borough.
C. Such clear sight triangle shall be determined by the distances
stated below, which shall be measured along the centerlines of the
rights-of-way (or cartways where rights-of-way do not exist) of
streets/accessways/driveways. Such distances shall be measured
from the intersection of such lines, with the third leg of the triangle
connecting the opposite ends of each leg, as shown in the
illustration below.
D. A 100 feet length shall be used along the centerline of an arterial
street. A 75 feet length shall be used along the centerline of any
other street or any accessway or driveway required to provide a
clear sight triangle, except as stated in subsection eight (E), below.
E. Except, where a local street or driveway or accessway serving two
or more nonresidential principal uses enters onto an arterial street,
a clear sight triangle shall be used with a distance of 350 feet along
the arterial street and only 20 feet back from the existing right-ofway
of the arterial street measured along the centerline of the local
street, driveway or accessway, instead of the clear sight triangle
stated above.
F. An applicant for any new driveway onto a Borough-owned collector
street shall prove that the driveway would meet the same PennDOT
clear sight triangle requirements as if the street was a State road.
9. Cul-de-Sac Streets.
A. Cul-de-sac streets shall be permitted with a maximum length of 400
feet. Cul-de-sac streets must be provided with a turn-around with a
minimum paved radius of 40 feet to the face of the outside curb and
a minimum radius of 50 feet to the legal right-of-way. A 35 feet
minimum paved radius shall be permitted if and when the applicant
proves that such street would meet PennDOT requirements for
liquid fuels reimbursement, considering any changes in PennDOT
standards that may occur after the adoption of this Chapter.
B. The circular right-of-way of the cul-de-sac shall maintain a
minimum 10 feet width between the edge of paving and the edge of
the right-of-way. The circular paving of the cul-de-sac shall be
§ 22-1004 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-1004
FWD:622
connected to the approach paving by an arc having a radius of not
less than 50 feet.
C. The Commission may permit acceptable alternative turn-around
designs, including any turn-arounds of acceptable radii
incorporated into a parking court or a landscaped island (with an
acceptable system for maintenance) within a cul-de-sac.
D. No street shall dead-end without an approved turn-around at the
end of the street. Temporary stub streets shall be required to
include at least a temporary cul-de-sac if the stub would be longer
than 150 feet or serve more than three dwellings or lots.
E. The maximum cross slope on the circular part of a cul-de-sac shall
be 7%.
F. A cul-de-sac street shall serve a maximum of 25 dwelling units.
10. Maintenance. As a condition for final plan approval, the developer must
enter into a legally binding agreement which shall state who is to be
responsible for the improvement and maintenance of any street not
offered for dedication. If an association of lot owners is to be made
responsible, such association must be legally organized prior to plan
approval by an agreement approved by the Borough.
11. Street Design and Construction Standards.
A. Streets shall be graded, improved and surfaced to the grades and
dimensions shown on plans, profiles and cross sections submitted
by the developer that meet applicable Borough standards.
B. Right-of-Way Grading.
(1) The entire right-of-way shall be graded to the approved cross
section. All trees, stumps and other material deemed
unsuitable by the Borough Engineer shall be removed. The
excavation shall be backfilled and suitably compacted to the
satisfaction of the Borough Engineer.
(2) The finished street surface shall be crowned in conformance
with the Borough specifications.
(3) A proper super-elevation (banked curves) shall be provided on
arterial and collector streets when required by the Borough
Engineer.
C. Grading Beyond Right-of-Way.
(1) The subdivider or developer may be required to grade beyond
the right-of-way line in order to provide continuous slope from
the right-of-way line to the proposed elevation of the abutting
property.
§ 22-1004 FOREWORD § 22-1004
FWD:623
(2) Such grading beyond the right-of-way shall generally maintain
the original directions of slope, except where stormwater
runoff designs dictate changes.
(3) Approved plans, either preliminary or final, showing proposed
grading, shall be a covenant running with the land unless
altered by written permission from Borough Council.
(4) In areas of earth excavation or earth fill, such grading shall be
done to a maximum slope of four feet horizontal to one feet
vertical. In areas of rock excavation, such grading shall be
done to a maximum slope of one-foot horizontal to two feet
vertical.
(5) In no case shall the required street grading extend onto an
adjoining property with a different landowner, unless the other
adjoining property owner gives a written agreement to the
developer to accomplish such work.
D. Trench Excavation. All trenches excavated within the cartway of an
existing or proposed public street or right-of-way shall be
mechanically compacted with backfill acceptable to the Borough
Engineer or be stone backfilled if the cartway is to be paved in the
same construction season.
E. Drainage of streets shall comply with § 22-1008 of this Chapter.
F. Street Construction Standards. All street pavements shall consist
of the following construction, unless the following standard is
revised by the Borough Council by resolution, or unless a specific
different standard is required by PennDOT for a State road:
(1) One and one half inch ID-2A or ID-2 wearing surface on six
inches bituminous concrete base course on six inches two RC
subbase.
(2) All materials, construction procedures and other specifications
shall be in conformance with the latest edition of the PennDOT
Manual Form 408.
G. Subgrade. All streets shall be constructed upon a properly rolled
and crowned subgrade at 1/4 inch per foot cross slope.
H. Alternative Street Specifications. An applicant may, if
recommended by the Borough Engineer and approved by Borough
Council, use an alternative road bed design that is specifically
recommended for that type of street by a current official
publication of PennDOT. The alternate design must provide load
capabilities equivalent to or higher than the capabilities of the
designs set forth above.
12. Private Streets. See the provisions of § 22-1004(1)(B)(2) regarding
private streets.
§ 22-1004 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-1004
FWD:624
13. Required Traffic Improvements.
A. Purpose. In recognition of the provisions of the State traffic impact
fee amendments to and §§ 22-503(2)(ii) and 22-503(3) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, this Section is
primarily intended to ensure that streets bordering a subdivision or
land development are coordinated and of such widths and grades
and in such locations as deemed necessary to accommodate
prospective traffic and to facilitate fire protection and to ensure
that the access into and out of subdivisions and land developments
is sufficiently safe.
B. Process. This subsection 13 shall be carried out through
determinations of Borough Council, after considering any
recommendations of the Planning Commission, the Borough
Engineer, the applicant, the applicant's professional
representatives, any comments from PennDOT that may be
provided regarding a State road and any professional traffic studies
that may have been submitted.
C. Onsite/Abutting Traffic Improvements. If, in the determination of
Borough Council, there is a reasonable relationship between the
need for an "onsite improvement" of a street and the traffic created
by a proposed subdivision or land development, the applicant for
such subdivision or land development shall be required to complete
the needed improvement.
(1) Widening of Abutting Roads. An applicant for any land
development or major subdivision shall be required to pave any
existing unpaved street and widen the cartway and any
shoulders of abutting streets to Borough standards to result in
a minimum paved cartway width of 15 feet on each side of the
centerline.
(a) The applicant shall only be responsible for improvements
from the centerline of the street right-of-way inward
towards the project's lot lines, unless the Commission
determines that improvements on the other side of the
centerline are essential for public safety.
(b) A lesser width may be permitted where the Commission
determines that such would be appropriate and/or would
save mature trees.
(c) A wider width may be required by the Commission where
needed along a collector or arterial street.
(2) Such improvements and right-of-way shall be required unless
the Commission determines:
§ 22-1004 FOREWORD § 22-1004
FWD:625
(a) That there is not a reasonable relationship between the
improvements and the traffic created by the proposed
development.
(b) That widening or right-of-way or other improvements are
not needed, or that a lesser improvement is sufficient.
(c) That PennDOT specifically refuses in writing to allow such
improvement to a State road in the foreseeable future, in
which case the Borough may still require that abutting
right-of-way be dedicated to the Borough or reserved for
future dedication if needed in the future.
(3) Any improvement to a State street shall meet all PennDOT
standards.
D. Types of Required Traffic Improvements.
(1) The following shall be the definition of "onsite improvement,"
(unless this definition is amended by State law): all street
improvements constructed on the applicant's property or the
improvements constructed on the property abutting the
applicant's property necessary for the ingress or egress to the
applicant's property.
(2) Onsite improvements may include, but are not limited to, a new
or upgraded traffic signal, land dedication to improve an
abutting intersection, realignment of an abutting curve in a
road or the widening of the abutting cartway and right-of-way.
(3) The Borough shall not require an applicant to fund or complete
a road improvement that is an "offsite improvement," unless
the Commission determines that such improvement is clearly
essential for the physical safety of the occupants/residents of
the proposed development (such as for emergency vehicle
access).
E. Funding. In place of completing a required street improvement as a
condition of final approval, an applicant may enter into a legally
binding development agreement with the Borough for the applicant
to fund the improvement.
F. Accounting. Any such funds may be placed in escrow until such
time as sufficient funds are available for a more comprehensive
improvement, with interest being used towards the cost of the
improvement. Any such funds received under this subsection shall
be accounted for separately.
G. Staging. Any completion or funding of a required road
improvement may occur in stages in relationship to the stages of
the development if so stated in a legally binding development
agreement and/or as a condition of final plan approval.

§ 22-1006. Lots. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/12/1999, § 1006]
1. Maximum Length. Residential blocks shall not exceed 600 feet in
length, unless permitted by Borough Council.
A. Future Street. Blocks shall be considered to be separated by the
reservation as part of an approved subdivision plan of a 50 feet
minimum right-of-way for a future cross street that in the future is
intended to serve interior lots. Such future street is not required to
be constructed until such time as the lots fronting on it are
subdivided. Such right-of-way shall be retained in the same
ownership as the abutting interior lot(s) until a street may be
developed.
2. Minimum Length. Residential blocks shall have a minimum length of
200 feet, unless otherwise approved by Borough Council.
3. Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots, except
where access is limited by virtue of an adjoining arterial street or by
virtue of topographic limitations, unless permitted by Borough Council.
1. Zoning. All lots shall conform to all requirements of the Borough Zoning
Ordinance [Chapter 27], as were in effect at the time such subdivision
plan was duly submitted.
2. The average depth-to-width ratio of a new lot shall generally not be
greater than three to one, unless otherwise permitted by the
Commission.
3. Side lot lines shall abut and be approximately at right angles to straight
streets and on radial lines to curved streets, unless otherwise permitted
by the Commission. Pointed or very irregularly shaped lots shall be
avoided.
4. Lots abutting two streets on two noncontiguous sides shall ordinarily
not be created, except as needed to avoid direct vehicular access onto
an arterial or collector street by individual driveways. This shall not
apply to a lot abutting an expressway.
5. Rear Yard Buffers Along Major Streets.
A. Any residential lot with a rear yard directly abutting a collector or
arterial street shall, along such rear yard, include a 10 feet wide
planting strip along the back of the lot, with access across this strip
clearly prohibited on notes on any approved plan.
B. Any fencing in the rear of such lots shall be placed on the inside of
such plantings. Such plantings shall be placed so that they do
obstruct safe sight distance.

§ 22-1007. Floodplain Requirements. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/12/1999,
§ 1007]
Subdivisions and land developments shall comply with the Borough of
Gettysburg Floodplain Regulations (Ord. 1010-83, 7/12/1983, as may be
amended from time to time) [Chapter 8].
§ 22-1008. Stormwater Management. [Ord. 1223-99, 4/12/1999,
§ 1008]
6. A lot, other than dedicated open space, that would not be suitable for
uses permitted in that zoning district shall not be created as part of a
subdivision, but instead shall be incorporated into another lot.
1. General Provisions.
A. All subdivisions and land developments shall be planned and
designed in a manner which carefully control stormwater runoff.
B. Consistency With Act 167 of 1978 (32 P.S. § 680 et seq.). The
provisions of this Section shall apply, except where a specific
provision of an Act 167 related ordinance supersedes this Chapter
under a specific provision of the Pennsylvania Stormwater
Management Act, such as regarding release rates. In case of any
differences between an Act 167 related ordinance and this Section
where the Act 167 ordinance does not supersede, then the more
restrictive requirement shall apply.
C. Velocity Control Measures. The Commission, based upon the
recommendations of the Borough Engineer, may require specific
sizes or types of stormwater velocity control measures based upon
both the need to control the velocity and upon long-term
maintenance concerns.
D. Stormwater runoff from any subdivision or land development
(including during construction and earthmoving) shall not occur at
a peak rate (measured in cubic feet per second) that is greater after
development than occurred prior to development.
E. Runoff shall be controlled from a site using appropriate means of
detention of water on the site and/or other approved types of
Stormwater management, within the requirements of this Chapter.
F. Runoff that is detained shall be held and released at a
predetermined controlled rate by appropriately installed devices.
The release shall be in the same manner as the natural or
predevelopment means of discharge from a site (such as point
discharge or sheet flow).
G. Stormwater runoff shall not be increased or redirected in such a
way that it results in hazards to persons or property or interferes
with the normal movement of vehicles.
§ 22-1006 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-1008
FWD:628
H. All stormwater management methods are subject to approval by
the Borough Engineer, including all outlet locations.
I. All lots shall be laid out and graded to prevent cross lot drainage, to
provide positive drainage away from proposed building locations
and any primary or alternate septic system locations. Stormwater
shall also be not be redirected towards buildings or onlot septic
systems off of the site.
J. All stormwater management plans shall take into account and
provide for existing flow from upstream areas within the entire
watershed.
K. The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered to increase flows nor shall the
concentration of water runoff be increased because of development
without the written approval of all adjacent landowners.
L. No stormwater runoff or watercourse shall be diverted in a way
that overloads existing drainage systems or creates flooding or the
need for additional drainage structures on other private properties
or public lands without Borough approval of provisions to be made
by the developer for properly handling such conditions, including
water runoff impoundments, if necessary.
M. An adequate storm sewer system consisting of inlets and
underground drainage pipes with approved outlets shall be
constructed where the runoff of stormwater and the prevention of
erosion cannot be accomplished satisfactorily by surface drainage
facilities, as determined by the Commission, based upon the
recommendation of the Borough Engineer, based upon the
expected velocity and depth of the stormwater flows and the
proximity of dwellings.
N. Sequence of Construction. No substantial grading shall occur and
no building permits shall be issued for any building unless any
detention basin, siltation basin or improved major swale approved
to handle the resulting runoff is in place. Any detention basin shall
be seeded and stabilized and have an installed outlet structure
prior to the construction of any streets or buildings within that
drainage basin.
O. Phasing. The phasing of a development shall ensure that all
stormwater facilities needed to manage runoff from a phase are in
place and functioning adequately prior to and after the
construction of buildings in that phase. This shall, for example,
include the extension of the main outfall line. This may require the
use of temporary structures, which shall be shown on submitted
plans. If the development occurs in phases, the entire system shall
be shown as part of the preliminary plan submission.
§ 22-1008 FOREWORD § 22-1008
FWD:629
2. Calculations of Stormwater Runoff. The methods and design storms
described in any applicable Act 167 ordinances shall apply.
A. The stormwater calculations shall include the following:
(1) Information required for preliminary and final plans within
Parts 5, 6 and 7 of this Chapter.

development, "meadow in good condition," as described in Act 167,
shall be used as the starting base for the predevelopment
calculation.
3. Design Submission.
A. Within the one-hundred-year floodplain, any stormwater
management structures and systems shall be designed to handle a
one-hundred-year storm. A twenty-four-hour Type II storm shall be
used if using the soil complex method.
B. The stormwater management plan shall show that a one-hundredyear,
twenty-four-hour storm can be safely conveyed without
jeopardizing any principal building on or adjacent to the site.
C. All plans showing the proposed storm drainage construction must
be accompanied by a complete design stamped and signed by a
Pennsylvania Registered Engineer or Pennsylvania registered
landscape architect.

F. Slopes of Basin. The maximum inside slope of earth detention basin
embankments shall be three horizontal to one vertical. The
maximum outside slope shall be three to one.
G. Outfall. Where no existing point of concentration exists, the outfall
from a detention basin shall not discharge closer than 30 feet from
the adjoining property line, unless permission is given, in writing,
by said adjacent property owner.
H. Where discharge from the detention basin is to be spread into sheet
flow, the allowable flow shall be determined by the predevelopment
flow rate for a two year storm, across the length of the spreader.
I. Antiseep collars and a cutoff trench shall be required on basins
having a berm height exceeding five feet. Watertight antiseep
collars shall be installed around the discharge pipe at intervals not
to exceed 24 feet or as approved by the Borough Engineer. Such
collar shall extend a minimum of two feet beyond the outside of the
pipe.
J. Basins not having direct access to a public street shall have a

zoning district or a public street, unless the basin would meet
all of the following conditions:
(a) It would have an average slope of less than four to one on
the inside of the berm of the basin.
(b) Either: (i) both the inside and outside of the basin would be
planted in grass and intended to be mowed or planted in
other attractive vegetative ground cover; or (ii) would be
designed to closely resemble a natural pond.
(c) The basin would not be surrounded by a primarily metal
fence.
§ 22-1008 GETTYSBURG CODE § 22-1008
FWD:632
(2) Any required screening shall be approved by the Commission.
This landscaping shall not be required along an area where
natural vegetation will be maintained that will completely
fulfill this purpose.
(3) Thorny and prickly shrubs (that are also attractive) are
encouraged to be used around detention basins to discourage
entry by children.
N. Areas of stormwater basins that are visible from streets and
dwellings shall be attractively maintained.
O. All outflow structures from storage facilities shall be equipped with
a regulatory device that will permit modification to regulate the
amount of outflow. Suitable antivortex and/or velocity retarders
shall be used.
(1) Entrances to stormwater pipes, including outflow pipes in
detention basins, shall have childproof grates or similar
devices.
P. Retention Basins. Aeration devices may be required, dependent
upon the quality of the influent and detention time.
Q. Recreation. When reasonable, efforts should be made to allow
suitable recreational uses of portions of detention areas. This might
include designing a detention basin with a low-flow channel so that
only a portion would be wet after a minor storm and the remainder
would be well drained during all, except the most serious storms.
These areas may be acceptable at the discretion of the Borough as
part of any Borough requirement to provide recreation land.
7. Construction Standards.
A. Standards. Construction and materials of storm drainage and
control facilities (including pipes) and erosion control facilities
shall be in accordance with the approved plans and any

P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer then the tax levied by the Borough of Gettysburg under the
authority of the Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and
such 1/2 shall become effective without any action on the part of the
Borough Council; provided, however, that the Borough of Gettysburg
and any other political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same
person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective
rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively

The Borough Council of the Borough of Gettysburg finds that business
property owners in the Steinwehr Avenue area of the Borough of Gettysburg
continue in their desire to strengthen and revitalize the physical and
economic foundations of that area for the benefit of business and property
owners to enable that area to prosper as a destination for residents and
tourists. Furthermore, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has adopted
enabling legislation, specifically the Neighborhood Improvement District
Act, Act No. 2000-130, 73 P.S. § 831 et seq. (hereinafter the "Act"),
authorizing the establishment, administration and continuation of
neighborhood improvement districts to enable property owners in
neighborhoods to provide services to their neighborhoods that supplement
municipal services otherwise provided, and the Act provides for the

be necessary and desirable to strengthen the Steinwehr Avenue area and
improve the probability of success of businesses and the preservation of
the amenities of life for residents and commercial occupants within the

Improvement District. Therefore, the Borough Council of the Borough of

property owners relative to the final plan and following its review,
consideration and acceptance of a third-party review of the said
Neighborhood Improvement District, its management association and
administrator and the services and programs provided within the said
Neighborhood Improvement District, believes that the Steinwehr Avenue,

be continued beyond its original automatic termination date by the
reauthorization and reenactment of the enabling ordinance which originally
created and established the said Neighborhood Improvement District.50

The Borough Council of the Borough of Gettysburg finds that residential
neighborhood infrastructure maintenance is an important community
development task that is difficult for municipalities to sustain where limited
financial resources are often allocated to larger scale and higher priority
public improvements projects. Furthermore, the Commonwealth of

to enable property owners in neighborhoods to provide services to their
neighborhoods that supplement municipal services otherwise provided. The
legislation provides for the assessment of property owners within a
neighborhood improvement district to pay for those additional services, and

year, respectively, and subject to income tax, together with such
other information as the Department may require. Every taxpayer
filing a return shall, at the time of filing the return, pay to the

annual return and pay the income tax due on or before April 15 of
the succeeding year.
H. The TCC may, by regulation, waive the requirements for a quarterly
return and payment of income tax under specified circumstances,
including those instances where a taxpayer's annual taxable
income is less than a specified amount.
1. Every employer having an office, factory, workshop, branch, warehouse
or other place of business within the municipality, having imposed a tax
on earned income or net profits within its municipal boundaries, who

registered, shall, within 15 days after becoming an employer, register
with the tax officer or other designated agent the employer's name and
address and such other information as the Department or tax officer
may require.
2. Every employer shall require each new employee to complete a
certificate of residency form, which form shall be an addendum to the
federal employee's withholding allowance certificate (Form W-4 or
successor form). An employer shall also require any employee who
changes an address or domicile to complete a certificate of residency
form, which forms are available from the Department or the tax officer
upon request. The purpose of said form shall be to help identify the
political subdivision where an employee lives and works.
1. Every employer having an office, factory, workshop, branch, warehouse
or other place of business within the municipality, imposing a tax on
earned income or net profits within the municipality, who employs one
or more persons, exclusive of domestic servants and Maryland
residents, for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation, shall
deduct at the time of payment thereof the greater of the employee's
resident tax or the employee's nonresident tax imposed by this Part 8 on
the earned income due to his, her or its employee or employees and
shall, on or before April 30 of the current year, July 31 of the current

FWD:696
taxes deducted during the preceding quarterly periods ending March
31 of the current year, June 30 of the current year, September 30 of
the current year and December 31 of the current year, respectively.
Such return, unless otherwise agreed upon between the tax officer
and employer, shall show the name and social security number of
each such employee, the compensation of such employee during such
preceding three-month period, the tax deducted therefrom, the political
subdivisions imposing the tax upon such employee, the total
compensation of all such employees during such preceding quarterly
period, and the total tax deducted therefrom and paid with the return
as well as any other information prescribed by the Department or the
tax officer.
2. Any employer who, for two of the preceding four quarterly periods, has
failed to deduct the proper tax or any part thereof or who has failed to
pay over the proper amount of tax to the tax officer may be required by
the tax officer to file a return and pay the tax monthly. In such cases,
payments of tax shall be made to the tax officer on or before the last day
of the month succeeding the month for which the tax was withheld.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 1 above, the provisions of
this Subsection 3 shall apply if any employer has more than one place of
employment in more than one tax collection district. Within 30 days
following the last day of each month, the employer may file the return
required by Subsection 1 above and pay the total amount of tax due
from employees in all work locations during the preceding month to the
tax officer for either the tax collection district in which the employer's
payroll operations are located or as determined by the Department. The
return and tax deducted shall be filed and paid electronically. The
employer must file a notice of intention to file combined returns and
make combined payments with the tax officer for each place of
employment at least one-month prior to filing its first combined return
or making its first combined payment. This subsection shall not be
construed to change the location of an employee's place of employment
for purposes of nonresident tax liability.
4. On or before February 28 of the succeeding year, every employer shall
file with the tax officer, or other designated tax officer to whom tax
which has been deducted, has been remitted as required herein:
A. An annual return showing the total amount of compensation paid,
the total amount of tax deducted, the total amount of tax paid to the
tax officer for the period beginning January 1 of the current year
and ending December 31 of the current year, and any other

employer who willfully or negligently fails or omits to make the
deductions required by this section shall be liable for payment of the
taxes which the employer is required to withhold to the extent that such
taxes have not been recovered from the employee. The failure or
omission of any employer to make the deductions required by this
section shall not relieve any employee from the payment of the tax or
from complying with the requirements of this Part 8 relating to the
filing of declarations and returns.
7. No employer shall be required to deduct or withhold taxes, file returns
or pay taxes with regard to residents of Maryland.
1. It shall be the duty of the tax officer to collect and receive the taxes,

acknowledge a bond to the TCC appointing such tax officer. The bond

procedures adopted by the TCC and shall comply with all regulations
promulgated and adopted by the Department under the Act.

earned income tax paid on the taxpayer's ordinary and necessary
business expenses to the extent that such expenses are not paid by the

persons subject to such examination. Such examination or audits shall
be conducted by the tax officer and any agents in accordance with 53
Pa.C.S.A., Chapter 84, Subchapter C (relating to the local taxpayers bill
of rights).
6. Any information gained by the tax officer or designated agents or by any
other official or agent of the taxing district as a result of any
declarations, returns, investigations, hearings or verifications required
or authorized by this Part 8 shall be and remain confidential, except for
official purposes and except in accordance with a proper judicial order
or as otherwise provided by law.
7. The tax officer is authorized to establish different filing, reporting and

for the recovery of taxes due and unpaid under this Part 8.
2. Any suit brought to recover the tax imposed by this Part 8 shall be
begun within three years after: (a) such tax is due; or (b) the declaration
or return has been filed; or (c) a redetermination of compensation or
net profits by the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, whichever date
is later; provided, however, that this limitation shall not prevent the
institution of a suit for the collection of any tax due or determined to be
due in the following cases:
A. Where no declaration or return was filed by any person although a
declaration or return was required to be filed by him under the
provisions of this Part 8, there shall be no limitation.
B. Where an examination of the declaration or return filed by any
person or of other evidence relating to such declaration or return in
the possession of the tax officer reveals a fraudulent evasion of
taxes, there shall be no limitation.
C. Where any person has deducted taxes under the provisions of this
Part 8 and has failed to pay the amounts so deducted to the tax
officer or where any person has willfully failed or omitted to make
the deductions required by this Part 8, there shall be no limitation.

3. The tax officer may sue for recovery of an erroneous refund, provided
that such suit is begun two years after making such refund, except that
the suit may be brought within five years if it appears that any part of
the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of material fact.

recovering delinquent taxes by any other means provided by the Act.
Further, nothing set forth herein shall be construed to limit a tax officer,
a tax collection district or a political subdivision from recovering
delinquent taxes by any other means provided by the Act."
1. Except as may be provided for in Subsection 2 below, in the event that
any tax imposed in this Part 8 is not paid when due, interest shall
accrue at the same rate a taxpayer is required to pay to the

the unpaid tax for each month or fraction thereof during which the tax
remains unpaid shall be added and collected; but the amount of penalty

the recovery of tax, the taxpayer liable for the tax shall, in addition, be
liable for the costs of collection, interest and penalties, including but
not limited to court costs and attorney's fees.
2. Pursuant to the Act, the Department may establish conditions under
which a tax officer, with the concurrence of the TCC, may abate interest
or penalties that would otherwise be imposed for the nonreporting or
underreporting of income tax liabilities or for nonpayment of taxes
previously imposed and due if the taxpayer files delinquent returns and
pays the tax in full.

are determined to be substantially true and correct and the tax due is
paid within the prescribed time.

return required by this Part 8, any employer who fails, neglects or
refuses to register or to pay the tax deducted from employees or fails,
neglects or refuses to deduct or withhold the tax from employees, any

tax or duties as herein provided.
§ 24-813. Severability. [Ord. 1393-11, 11/14/2011]

be held to be unconstitutional, illegal or otherwise invalid, that decision
shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Part 8 or of the Borough
person who refuses to permit the tax officer or any agent so designated
to examine books, records, or papers, and any person who knowingly
makes any incomplete, false or fraudulent return or attempts to do
anything whatsoever to avoid the full disclosure of the amount of net
profits or earned income in order to avoid the payment of the whole or
any part of the tax imposed by this Part 8 shall, upon conviction thereof,

the provisions of this Part 8 shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced

imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
4. The penalties imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed by any other section of this Part 8.
5. The failure of any person to receive or procure forms required for
making the declaration or returns required by this Part 8 shall not
excuse him or her from making such declaration or return.
6. The Borough of Gettysburg shall approve, by adoption of a resolution of
the Borough Council, a cost of collection schedule to be imposed by the
designated tax officer for the collection of taxes on earned income and
net profits upon any taxpayer whose taxes are or become delinquent
and/or remain due and unpaid. Said cost of collection schedule may be
modified from time to time by resolution of the Borough Council upon
submission of amendments to said collection schedule adopted by the

1. The primary purpose of this Part 8 is to conform the local income tax
currently levied on earned income and net profits by the Borough of
Gettysburg with the Act and to do so within the time frame set forth in
the Act.
2. Any prior ordinance or resolution, and particularly the resolution
adopted on April 10, 1978, and then readopted on June 12, 1978,
levying such tax is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read
as set forth in this Part 8. To the extent that any previous ordinance or
resolution, or any portion thereof, is inconsistent or conflicts with this
Part, such ordinance or resolution, or any portion thereof, shall be
repealed to the extent of such inconsistency and/or conflict. To the
extent of the same or any prior ordinance or resolution levying such tax
in force immediately prior to enactment of this Part 8, this Part is
intended as a continuation of such prior ordinance or resolution and not
as the enactment of an ordinance imposing a new tax, except as to the
tax imposed on nonresidents herein, which is intended as a new tax. It
is the express intention of the Borough of Gettysburg to substitute the
tax provided for in this Part 8 in the place and stead of the earned
income and net profits tax imposed by prior ordinance or resolution and
particularly the said resolution adopted on April 10, 1978, and then
readopted on June 12, 1978. All other ordinances or resolutions and
parts of ordinances or resolutions inconsistent herewith are hereby
repealed. In the event that this Part 8 or any portion thereof is
determined to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the prior
ordinance or resolution, or portion thereof, levying a similar tax shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the adoption
of this Part. Nothing contained herein shall affect, impair or otherwise
abrogate any act done or liability incurred, nor shall any provisions of
this Part 8 affect, impair or preclude any suit or prosecution pending,
whether or not currently initiated, to enforce any right, penalty or
violation under the authority of any previous ordinance or resolution in
force prior to adoption of this Part.

If an eligible property is granted a tax exemption by meeting the total
occupiable building square footage requirements pursuant to this Part and

lower occupiable square footage that no longer satisfies such requirements,
the eligible property shall be subject to rollback taxes at 6% interest per
year of the exempt assessed valuation. The rollback tax is the difference
between the exempt assessed valuation under this Part versus the assessed
valuation if the property had not been granted a tax exemption, plus 6%
simple interest on that difference per year, dating back to the first tax year
of the approved exemption. In addition, the property subject to the rollback

proportionally applied to any new assessment so long as the tax
abatement period for the tax parcel of real estate in question has not
expired. This application is to ensure that each deteriorated property
that is granted a tax exemption receives the same percentage of tax
benefits before and after any county-wide reassessment.

PURPOSE; COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
§ 27-101. Title. [Ord. 1352-08, 5/5/2008]
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Gettysburg Borough
Zoning Ordinance."
§ 27-102. Purpose. [Ord. 1352-08, 5/5/2008]
The purpose of the chapter is:
§ 27-103. Statement of Community Development Objectives. [Ord.
1352-08, 5/5/2008]
Community development objectives are as follows:
A. To promote, protect and facilitate the public health, safety and general
welfare, coordinated and practical community development, proper
density of population, emergency management preparedness and
operations, the provision of adequate light and air, access to incident
solar energy, police protection, vehicle parking and loading space,
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, recreational facilities, public
grounds, the provision of a safe, reliable and adequate water supply for
domestic, commercial, or industrial use, and other public requirements;
as well as the preservation of the natural, scenic and historic values in
the environment and preservation of wetlands and floodplains.
B. To prevent the overcrowding of land, blight, danger and congestion in
travel and transportation, and loss of health, life, or property from fire,
flood, panic or other dangers.
C. To provide for the use of land for residential housing of various dwelling
types encompassing all basic forms of housing, including single-family
and two-family dwellings, and a reasonable range of multifamily
dwellings in various arrangements.
D. To accommodate reasonable overall community growth, including
population and employment growth, and opportunities for development
of a variety of residential dwelling types and nonresidential uses.
A. To have a better quality of life for all of those living, working, shopping,
learning, etc., within the community.
B. To maintain a financially viable community. Broadly speaking, if we can
maintain an attractive place to live and an attractive place to do
business, the community will prosper. The presence of the Gettysburg
College, the Gettysburg Seminary, and the Gettysburg National Park
with its related visitor activities have the potential of bringing into the
community enough new money to maintain a healthy economy and tax
base. It therefore follows that the Borough, the College, the Seminary
and the National Park Service should cooperate closely to maintain a
§ 27-101 FOREWORD § 27-103
FWD:729
healthy relationship. This spirit of cooperation must also be extended
to Cumberland Township and Straban Township because many of the
actions necessary to improve the quality of life within the Borough
must necessarily involve the entire area surrounding the Borough. In
fact, many of the actions that need to be taken are virtually impossible
without the cooperation of the entire area.
C. To protect our natural resources. It has been determined that our most
important natural resources are the physical aspects of the land, that is,
the overall appearance of the area, and our historical heritage  the
Gettysburg Address, President Eisenhower's home and other historical
events and places.
D. To protect natural and historic resources from exploitation and
desecration. With the proper planning, these resources can be
protected.
E. To develop in the proper areas and regulate development so that it does
not adversely impact our natural and historic resources.
F. To encourage the complete cooperation of the Borough, the townships
and the National Park Service. The first and most important is the
development of an area-wide sewage treatment facility. Second is an
area-wide water treatment and distribution facility; this would include
the development of water resources. There are a number of actions that
must take place to revitalize the downtown area. This area must provide
a unique shopping experience for the resident as well as the visitor, in
order to successfully compete with present and future shopping
centers. A circumferential highway system, a shuttle bus service for
visitors, first-class parking facilities, and reduced traffic congestion will
improve the attractiveness of the Borough. On-street parking could be
eliminated; this would enhance the appearance of the shopping area.
The off-street parking must be first class: paved, illuminated, and
landscaped, with walkways to the main streets. The rear of all buildings
in the present shopping area would have to be upgraded and be inviting
to the shopper.
G. To protect and enhance this historic area, through two significant
actions that have been already taken  the enactment of the Borough
Historic District Ordinance [Chapter 11] and the Borough Sign
Ordinance [Chapter 19]. Efforts should be made to install authentic
period ornamental lighting, plant trees and develop landscaped miniparks.
Entrances should be made more attractive. Unsightly objects,
such as TV antennas, and unnecessary traffic signs should be
eliminated. In order to maintain the vitality of the downtown area, the
County Offices should be retained in the downtown area.
H. To develop affordable/attainable housing, housing for age-qualified
persons, and market-rate housing. This could give new life to certain
areas and would stimulate upgrading of other substandard housing.
§ 27-103 GETTYSBURG CODE § 27-103
FWD:730
§ 27-104. Miscellaneous Legal Provisions. [Ord. 1352-08, 5/5/2008]
I. To stimulate commercial development within the Borough. A sufficient
amount of commercial development must take place in order to raise
the tax base and provide the necessary income to properly operate the
Borough. With historic development and reasonable zoning, certain
commercial interests will want to become part of the community.
Zoning, of course, is of prime importance. If the community can be
properly zoned, everything can be kept in its proper place. We are
indeed fortunate that up to this point in time the community has
developed in a fairly reasonable and acceptable manner. There are
indications that this may not continue indefinitely. It is therefore
essential that we plan for the future. If we can plan properly for a
quality environment, many of the other qualities of good living will
follow.
J. To help achieve the specific goals listed in the Gettysburg Borough
Comprehensive Plan, adopted May 13, 1996 (as may be amended).
1. Application. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings,
structures, uses, land, and all accessory buildings, structures and uses.
Nothing in this chapter shall require any change in plans or
construction of a use for which a building permit has been heretofore
issued prior to the effective date of this chapter.
2. Interpretation.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the health, safety and general
welfare of the Borough. It is not intended to interfere with,
abrogate, annul or cancel other rules, regulations, ordinances,
covenants or restrictions, except where this chapter imposes
greater restrictions, in which case the provisions of this chapter
shall apply.
B. Provisions for interpreting underlying and overlay districts shall be
as set forth in Part 3.
3. Severability. Should any section or provision of this chapter be declared
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole, or of any part thereof.
4. Amendment. The Borough Council may amend, or repeal, this chapter
at any time in accordance with the provisions of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.55 Before voting on the enactment of any
proposed amendment, the procedures prescribed in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall be followed.

extended or structurally altered (except as may be required by law
to assure the structural safety of the building) and any
nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or extended except for the
following which may be authorized by special exception by the
Zoning Hearing Board:
(1) The extension of a nonconforming use of a portion of a building
to another portion of the building.
(2) The reasonable extension of a conforming building occupied by
a nonconforming use on a conforming lot, provided that such
extension is not detrimental to the character of the
surrounding area or the interests of the Borough and that such
extension shall conform to the area and height regulations of
the district in which it is located.
B. A nonconforming building may be rebuilt or altered only:
(1) To eliminate or decrease the building's nonconformity.
(2) For reasons as stated in Subsection 4 of this section.
3. Change. A nonconforming use of a building or land may be changed to a
nonconforing use of the same or more-restricted classifications, when
authorized by the Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception.

nonconforming use, which is wholly or partially destroyed by fire,
explosion, flood or other phenomenon, or which has been legally
condemned, may be reconstructed or repaired and/or used for the same
nonconforming use, provided that such building reconstruction shall be
commenced within one year from the date the building was destroyed
or condemned and shall be carried on without interruption.
5. Abandonment. If a nonconforming use of a building or land is
voluntarily abandoned and ceases for a continuous period of one year or
more, subsequent use of such building or land shall be in conformity
with the provisions of this Part.
1. Held in Single and Separate Ownership. A building may be erected or
altered on any lot held at the time this Part becomes effective (October
23, 1975) in single and separate ownership which is not of the required
minimum area or width or is of such unusual dimensions or shape that
the owner would have difficulty in providing the required open spaces
for the district in which such lot is located, provided that the plans for
the proposed building shall be approved by the Zoning Hearing Board
after review of the plans to assure reasonable compliance with the
intent of the regulations for the district.
2. Included in Approved Plans. Buildings may be erected on lots which are
not held in single and separate ownership at the time this Part becomes

the applicant shall provide evidence to allow the Board to, among other
things, consider the following standards. The Board shall hear requests
for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict
unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe
the form of application and may require preliminary application to the
Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
1. Requirements and Procedures. The Board shall conduct hearings and
make decisions in accordance with the provisions of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Code, as amended (53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.).

A. For Variances:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
§ 27-1701 FOREWORD § 27-1704

hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(6) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code and
this chapter.
B. For Special Exceptions:
(1) The applicant shall provide evidence to indicate to the Zoning
Hearing Board that:
(a) The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the Part
whereby it is permitted and the overall purposes contained in
Part 1.

the Comprehensive Plan and the current Gettysburg Borough
Zoning Map.

supplemental regulations set forth in Part 15, and the design
standards of Part 19.
(e) The proposed use will not substantially injure or detract from
the use of neighboring property or from the character of the
neighborhood and that the use of the adjacent property is
adequately safeguarded. Further, the proposed use, located on
the proposed property, with the present and proposed
§ 27-1704 GETTYSBURG CODE § 27-1704
FWD:854
characteristics of each, and considering the present and
proposed characteristics of the neighboring properties, will
not cause negative impacts over and above those typically
associated with such uses located and operated in a usual
manner.
(f) The proposed use will provide a fence or a planting screen and/
or additional yard or open space area to reduce the effect of
the proposed use upon adjacent properties.
(g) The proposed use will promote preservation or adaptive reuse
of the sites and structures identified by the Local Historic
District Regulations [Chapter 11].
(h) The proposed use complies with the required off-street parking
and loading regulations in Part 13.
(i) The proposed use will provide safe and adequate access to
streets and that the applicant will make any improvements
needed to guarantee compatibility with adjacent streets as
recommended by the Borough Engineer.
(j) The proposed use will provide for pedestrian access to the site.
(k) The proposed use will not adversely affect public facilities and
utilities, such as water, sewer, police and fire protection,
schools, etc.
(l) The proposed use will comply with the signage regulations of
Chapter 19 of the Borough Code.
(2) The Zoning Hearing Board may attach reasonable conditions as it
deems necessary to assure compliance with this chapter.

* Starting at this ordinance, numbers were assigned using year, month
and sequence, i.e., 6031, but the system was not followed consistently and
was dropped in 1968. This numbering system has been omitted to avoid
confusion, and the date of adoption has been used instead.
