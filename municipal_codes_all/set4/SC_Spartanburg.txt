PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Spartanburg, South Carolina of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1958 Code, as supplemented through July 7, 1986, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1958 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their locations within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the fourth section of Chapter 12 is 12-4. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Robert Coutre', Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

Request for designation shall be made on an appropriate form provided by the board. 
(2)  If the board determines that an area or site, based on the standards of this article, may be an appropriate candidate for designation as historic, the board may add it to a list of areas and sites considered appropriate for further investigation, deliberation, and possible recommendation to city council.

a.  The owner may treat the site as if it has already been designated as historic and apply for a certificate of appropriateness; or, 
b.  The owner may request an accelerated decision. In that event, the site under question will automatically be removed from the list of pending historic sites, unless the board acts within sixty (60) days after the request.

The request for such a meeting shall be made through the Spartanburg Department.

(7)  Any other information considered necessary by the board to reach a determination as to whether the site yields or may yield a reasonable return to the owner. 
(b)  After the hearing, the board shall review all of the evidence and determine within thirty (30) days whether the denial of a certificate will deprive the owner of reasonable use of or economic return from the site.

DISTRICTS CHARACTERISTICS
R-15 These districts exist for the protection of areas, most of
(Single Family Residential) them large in size, that have been and are being
developed predominantly for low-density single family
dwellings and low-density planned unit developments.
Accordingly, the use of land and buildings within such
areas is limited to single family detached dwellings, mixed
dwellings permitted in PDDs and to such nonresidential
uses as generally support and harmonize with these lowdensity
residential districts. Within these areas, home
occupations and the maintenance of professional offices
within homes are not characteristic and are prohibited
except as permitted in planned development districts.
R-12 These districts exist for the protection of areas, most of
(General Residential District) them large in size, that have been and are being developed
predominantly for low-density single family dwellings but
in which two family and multi-family

dwellings are occasionally found. Accordingly, the use of
land and buildings within such areas is limited to single
family detached dwellings, low-density two family and
multi-family dwellings, and to such nonresidential uses as
generally support and harmonize with a low-density
residential area.
R-8 SFD These districts exist for the protection of areas that have
(Single Family Residential) been developed primarily for medium density single
family dwellings. Accordingly, the use of land and
buildings within these areas is limited in general to single
family dwellings at a density of approximately seven units
per acre and such nonresidential uses which generally
support and are compatible with a medium-density
residential area. (*)
R-8 These districts exist for the protection of areas that have
(General Residential) been and are being developed predominantly for mediumdensity
single family dwellings but in which two family
and multi-family dwellings occur. Accordingly, the use of
land and buildings within these areas is limited in general
to dwellings at a density of around seven dwelling units
per acre and to such nonresidential uses as generally
support and harmonize with a medium-density residential
area.
R-6 These districts exist for the protection of areas that
(General Residential District) generally contain older residential structures, some of
which were originally large single family dwellings which
have been or may be converted to rooming houses or
multi-family dwellings, and others which have been built
on relatively small lots. Accordingly, the use of land and
buildings within these areas is limited in general to
dwellings at a density of around ten dwelling units per
acre, and to such nonresidential uses as generally support
and harmonize with a medium-high residential density.

conjunction with a dwelling which are more extensive
than home occupations under Section 302.6, and which
create a mixed use neighborhood predominately
residential in character. Live/work neighborhoods are also
designed to provide a transition between more intensive
office and commercial areas and low density residential
neighborhoods. (**)

GID (*) These districts are established solely for institutions. It
(General Institutional District) is intended that this district will develop in a manner that
will insure compatibility with residential neighborhoods.
LOD (*) These districts are established to provide for office uses,
(Limited Office District) including offices which have contact with the general
public, but which do not conduct sales of merchandise on
the premises. It is intended that this district will develop
that will insure compatibility with residential districts.
LC (*) These districts are established to provide for the
(Limited Commercial) Limited Commercial District transitional areas from
residential to office and limited commercial retail services
which do not generate large volumes of traffic, noise or
other harmful effects and which are compatible with
nearby residential uses. Moreover, these districts provide
for development along major thoroughfares, especially
between more intensely developed and higher traffic
generating areas and residential areas, in order to permit a
reasonable use of land along such thoroughfares without
the inherent ill effects of commercial strip development.
These districts also encourage conservation and
preservation of structurally sound residences in these
neighborhoods. No exterior storage is permitted in this
Zone.
B-1 These districts are intended primarily to serve the needs
(Neighborhood Shopping) of the surrounding residential neighborhood, providing
goods, and services that are day-to-day needs, generally
classed by merchants as convenience good and services.
Businesses which might tend to be a nuisance to the
immediately surrounding residential developments are
excluded, even though the goods or services offered might
be in the convenience category or classification.
DT-4, DT-5, DT-6 These districts are the central shopping areas of the City.
(Downtown) Here are concentrated activities which have primarily a
city-wide and regional function: large stores offering
comparison shoppers goods, specialty stores, business
services, banks and other financial institutions, offices,
theaters, hotels, and government building. The use of land
is intensive and this intensity of use is one of the main
determinants of the vitality of the Downtown Urban
Districts. It is the purpose of these regulations to
encourage such intensity of use and to exclude activities
which have a negative effect upon the proper functions of
the downtown area.

B-3 These districts serve several functions. They provide
(General Business) central concentrations of goods and services for more than
one neighborhood. They provide comparison shoppers
goods, convenience goods and services, specialty goods,
amusements and numerous services for less than a citywide
market. They also provide locations for small
businessmen with a city-wide market who cannot operate
in the downtown areas. The predominant purpose of all
these functions is retail trade.
B-4 These districts furnish goods and services which are
(Heavy Commercial) mainly used in support of retail trade for the City and the
region. The principal activities located here are
wholesaling, warehousing, transportation, heavy business
services, distribution, and some incidental processing.
Such functions are generally located in such a position
that they can support the Downtown Districts and at the
same time concentrate their heavy traffic requirements
near the main arteries for movement of goods and
services.
I-1 These districts are intended for industrial uses, which are
(Light Industrial) not offensive to nearby commercial or residential uses,
and for business uses which generally support and are
integrated with these industrial uses. Further development
of residences is prohibited from these districts to prevent
residences from being established under strongly adverse
conditions and to conserve the supply of industrial land.
I-2 These districts are for heavy industrial activities which
(Heavy Industrial) may be offensive, or incompatible, if located near
commercial or residential uses and for limited business
uses which support, or are compatible with, these heavy
industrial activities. Further development of residences is
prohibited from these districts to prevent residences from
being established under strongly adverse conditions and to
conserve the supply of industrial land.
? 202. INTERPRETATION OF THE ZONING MAP.
The Zoning Administrator shall interpret the Zoning Map according to the following guide:
A. Where such district boundaries are indicated as approximately following center lines
of streets and alleys, lot lines, stream center lines, property lines or corporate limit
lines, such lines shall be considered to be such boundaries.
B. In unsubdivided property or where a district boundary divides a lot, or where the
dimension is not shown on the official Zoning Map, the Zoning Administrator shall
determine the location of the zoning line by use of the appropriate scale.

additional one (1) foot beyond the required setback measured from the closest
property line provided that no residential building shall exceed fifty (50) feet
in height.(****) For permitted nonresidential buildings, there is no direct
limit on height, provided that a required front, side or rear yard faced by a
building wall must be increased by one foot for every one foot that such
building wall exceeds an average height of ten (10) feet.
B. Where necessary, front yard requirements will be increased to provide the
following minimum distances between street center lines and front building

A. Front Yards Reduced. The front yard requirement of this ordinance may be
reduced when the average front yard setbacks of adjacent lots are less than the
minimum required by this ordinance, as long as the following criteria are met:
(1) The average front yards on both sides of the subject lot are already
developed, and are either wholly or partially within one hundred (100) feet
of each side of the subject lot;
(2) The subject lot is within the same block of these adjacent lots;
(3) The subject lot is within the same zoning district as these adjacent lots;
(4) The subject lot is fronting on the same street as these adjacent lots; and
(5) The front yard is not less than the minimum required for a front yard
setback.
In such instances, the front yard on such a lot may be less than the required
front yard but not less than the average of the existing front yard on the
developed lots; provided that the front yard on such lot is not less than one-half
(1/2) the required front yard. For the purpose of computing such an average,
an adjacent vacant lot shall be considered as having the minimum required
front yard specified for the zoning district (see drawing on the next page).

54
B. Yards and Building Setback Lines. Where any required yard abuts a street
upon which an official setback line has been established by the City of
Spartanburg, such building setback line shall be considered the property line
for the purpose of measuring the depth of required yards.
C. Fences in Yards. Fences in residentially zoned areas may be erected, placed, or
maintained in the rear, corner side, and side yards to a maximum height of six
(6) feet above ground level. The height of a fence in a required front yard shall
not exceed four (4) feet. The height of any fence located within a yard
abutting a street line shall be measured from the sidewalk; and, if there is no
sidewalk, from the top of the curb, and, if there is no sidewalk or curb, from
the centerline of the street. No height restrictions apply to commercially or
industrially zoned areas. These regulations shall not apply to chain link fences
or to other wire fences of a similar type erected on public or private
recreational parks or areas, school grounds, church or synagogue grounds, and
around swimming pools. (Refer to Swimming Pool Ordinance No. S 284.) (*)
D. Projection Into Yards. Every part of a required yard or court shall be open
from its lowest point to the sky unobstructed, except for:
(1) Terraces, steps and uncovered porches which are not in any part more
than four (4) feet above the ground floor level and not within two and
one-half (2 ½) feet of any party lot line.
(2.) The ordinary projection of sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses,
ornamental features and eaves; provided, however, that none of the above
projections shall project into a minimum court more than six (6) inches

regulations of this Ordinance, uses not specifically listed are prohibited.
501.2 One Main Building on Lot. (*)
Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be located on a lot, and in no case
shall there be more than one (1) principal residential building and its accessory
buildings on a lot except as provided in Section IV of this Ordinance. Two or
more commercial buildings may be placed on a lot provided the buildings meet the
yard requirements of the zoning district applicable as provided for in Section IV of
this Ordinance, p. 36. In addition, Section V, 501.13. B.6, pp. 56-57 entitled 

intended to be used for a nonresidential use.
501.3 Required Yards Not to be Used by Another Building.
The minimum yards or other open spaces required by this Ordinance for each and
every building hereafter erected, moved or structurally altered shall not be
encroached upon or considered to meet the yard or open space requirements of any
other building except as provided in Subsection 501.4 of this Ordinance.
501.4 Accessory Buildings in Residential Districts.
Any permitted accessory use in a residential district including a private garage,
may be permitted in any rear yard, provided that such use does not occupy more
than thirty percent (30%) of the required rear yard. Such accessory building shall
not be located less than sixty (60) feet from the front lot line.
In case of a corner lot where the rear lot line abuts on the side line of an adjoining
lot, no accessory building shall be less than twenty-five (25) feet from the side
street line, except when built as a part of the main building, and shall be not less
than ten (10) feet from the rear lot line. In case of a corner lot where the rear line
of a lot abuts on the rear line of the lot adjoining on the rear, no accessory building
shall be less than fifteen (15) feet from the side street line and not less than five (5)
feet from any other lot line, except that where a rear or side lot line abuts an alley,

501.14 Flood Damage Prevention. (*)
A. Findings of Fact. The flood hazard areas of the City of Spartanburg are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
B. Statement of Purpose and Objectives. It is the purpose of this ordinance to
protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage
appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due
to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time
of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood
heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions
attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase
flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the ordinance prevents or regulates
the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
The objectives of this ordinance are to protect human life and health, to help
maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of
flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to
insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
The provisions of the ordinance are intended to minimize damage to public
facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and
sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged
business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective
of this ordinance is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.
Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital
natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of
peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge,
prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations,
recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best
served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the
natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water
bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains,
especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful
planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs.

C. Lands to Which this Ordinance Applies. This ordinance shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Spartanburg, as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in
its flood Insurance Study, dated May 16, 1986, with accompanying maps and
other supporting data, and any revision thereto, which are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be part of this ordinance.
D. Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall be
required in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance prior to the
commencement of any development activities.
E. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
F. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all
provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed
in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any
other powers granted under State Law. This ordinance is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
G. Partial Invalidity and Severability. If any part of this Ordinance is declared
invalid, the remainder of the Ordinance shall not be affected and shall remain
in force.
H. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required
by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on scientific and engineering consideration: larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Spartanburg or by any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
I. Penalties for Violation. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or
failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance
or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who
violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for
not more than 30 days, or both. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
City of Spartanburg from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.

3. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
A. General Standards. Development may not occur in the floodplain where
alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before
a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be
located out of the floodplain and that encroachments onto the floodplain are
minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are
required:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure;
2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage;
3. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damages;
4. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment
(including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding. This requirement does not
preclude outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut
off devices and back flow devices are installed to prevent contamination to
the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to the
building;
5. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
6. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;

1. Residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including mobile homes)
shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than 2 feet above the base
flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided
in accordance with Section 501.3.B.5.
2. Non-Residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no
lower than 2 feet above the level of the base flood elevation. No
basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be
floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure
below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and the effect of buoyancy. A registered, professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied.
Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
501.2.B.7. A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing
agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in

with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article
IV.
d) Mobile homes shall be permitted as provided for in Section V, ?
508 of this ordinance provided the anchoring and the elevation
standards of Section 501.3.B.3 are met.
e) Permissible uses within floodways may include: general
farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry,
wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural,
wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas,
picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are
acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or
fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a
no-rise certification. The uses listed in this subsection are
permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any
increase in base flood elevation.
9. Fill. Fill is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from
floodplains. Elevating buildings by other methods must be
considered. An applicant shall demonstrate that fill is the only
alternative to raising the building to at least 2 feet above the base
flood elevation, and that the amount of fill used will not affect the
flood storage capacity or adversely affect adjacent properties. The
following provisions shall apply to all fill placed in the special flood
hazard area:
a) Fill may not be placed in the floodway unless it is in accordance
with Section 501.3.B.8.a;
b) Fill may not be placed in tidal or non-tidal wetlands without the
required State and Federal permits;
c) Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. Dredged
material may be used as fill only upon certification of suitability

by a registered professional geotechnical engineer. Landfills,
rubble fills, dumps, and sanitary fills are not permitted in the
floodplain;
d) Fill used to support structures must comply with ASTM Standard
D-698, and its suitability to support structures certified by a
registered, professional engineer;
e) Fill slopes shall be no greater than two horizontal to one vertical.
Flatter slopes may be required when velocities may result in
erosion; and,
f) The use of fill shall not increase flooding or cause drainage
problems on neighboring properties.
C. Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevation And/Or
Floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in
Section 501.9.C., are small streams where no base flood data has been
provided or where no floodways have been identified. The following
provisions apply within such areas:
1. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within 100 feet
of the stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data
by a registered, professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrences of the base flood discharge.
2. If Section 501.3.C.1 is satisfied and base flood elevation data is
available from other sources, all new construction and substantial
improvements within such areas shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard ordinance provisions of Article IV and shall be elevated
or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in
accordance with Section 501.2.C.10. Data from preliminary, draft,
and final Flood Insurance Studies constitutes best available data. If
an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1,
Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used. When base
flood elevation data is not available from a Federal, State, or other
source, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above
the highest adjacent grade.
D. Standards for Subdivision Proposals.
1. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such
as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage. An access road at or above the base flood
elevation shall be provided to allow emergency access during flood
conditions;
2. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
Section 501: General and Supplemental Regulations
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
82
3. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development which is greater than the lesser of
five lots or five acres.
E. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones). Located within the
areas of special flood hazard established in Section 501.9.C., are areas
designated as shallow flooding. The following provisions shall apply within
such areas:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to the depth number
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall
be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
a) Have the lowest floor elevated to the depth number specified on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above the highest adjacent
grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be
elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade;
or,
b) Be completely floodproofed together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities to or above the level so that any space below
that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effects of buoyancy.
4. Variance Procedures.
A. Establishment of Appeal Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals as established
by the City of Spartanburg shall hear and decide requests for variances.
B. Right to Appeal. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or
any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Court.
C. Historic Structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
D. Agricultural Structures. Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an
agricultural structure in accordance with Technical Bulletin 7-93, Wetfloodproofing
Requirements for Structures Located in special Flood Hazards
Areas in accordance with the National flood Insurance Program, document
number FIA-TB-7, dated 12/93, and available from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. In order to minimize flood damages during the base
flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of
the conditions and considerations of Section 501.4.H.4, this Section, and the
Section 501: General and Supplemental Regulations
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.

following standards:
1. Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed
below:
a) Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for
the storage of farm machinery and equipment;
b) Steel grain bins and steel frame corn cribs;
c) General purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock which
are open on at least one side;
d) For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy
operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be
issued for structures which were substantially damaged. New
construction or substantial improvement of such structures must
meet the elevation requirements of Section 501.3.B.2 of this
ordinance; and,
e) Detached garages and storage sheds solely used for parking and
limited storage in connection with agricultural uses only, which are
no greater than 400 square feet in area.
2. The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an
existing building which is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant
materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements
below the base flood elevation;
3. The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structures
components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces
including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact
forces. Where flood velocities exceed 5 feet per second, fast-flowing
floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the buildings enclosure
walls or foundation walls;
4. The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of Section
501.3.B.5.a of this ordinance;
5. Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located
above the base flood elevation so that they are contained within a
watertight, floodproofed enclosure which is capable of resisting damage
during flood conditions. The structure must comply with Section
501.3.A.4 of this ordinance.
6. The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment
provisions of Section 501.3.B.8 of this ordinance; and,

84
permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base
flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove
contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a
specified site out of the floodplain in accordance with the temporary
development provisions of Section 501.3.B.6.
E. Considerations. In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified
in other sections of this ordinance, and;
1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and
the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the service provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
6. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development, and the relationship of the proposed uses to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
8. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
9. The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges; and,
10. Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain
areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure
exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage,
consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be
located, must be in the Special Flood Hazard Area and no other
alternative locations for the structure are available.
F. Findings. Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal board, in
writing, and included in the application for a variance. Additionally,
comments from the Department of Natural Resources, Land Resources and
Conservation District Division, State Coordinators Office, must be taken into
account and included in the permit file.

85
G. Floodways. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
H. Conditions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes
of this ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of the ordinance.
The following conditions shall apply to all variances:
1. Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in
violation of other Federal, State or local laws, regulations, or ordinances.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
3. Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient
cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
4. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation to
which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting
from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions.
5. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
6. Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other
development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this
ordinance. Violations must be corrected in accordance with Section
501.2.D.5 of this ordinance.

Section 501.15 -- Riparian Buffer Overlay District (*)
1. Intent and Purpose.
The City Council of Spartanburg, South Carolina finds that the protection of the streams and
water bodies of the City of Spartanburg is vital to the health, safety and economic welfare of its
citizens. Streams with natural vegetation maintained along their banks in the form of a
Riparian Buffer reduce the negative effects of erosion and sedimentation on properties within
the City and further downstream. Riparian buffers also trap and remove harmful contaminants
before they enter streams, thus protecting the water quality of streams within the City of
Spartanburg. Riparian buffers add to the aesthetic enjoyment of streams within the City, to the
overall appearance of the City and to the property values of properties within the City. It is the
intent of this ordinance to ensure that streams within the City are protected by Riparian
Buffers.
Note: A Riparian Buffer is the simplest and most cost effective way of reducing the
negative effects of storm water runoff on the streams and water bodies within the City of
Spartanburg, and consequently, the negative effect on properties along these streams. A
Riparian Buffer functions by leaving existing vegetation along existing streams: the
existing trees, shrubs and groundcover reduce the harmful effect of erosion and trap and
remove pollutants before they enter streams. Riparian Buffers protect the water quality
of streams within the City, add to the appearance of the City and help maintain property
values for properties along the streams and water bodies. Riparian buffers protect a
valuable resource and also reserve open space that can allow for the development of
future greenways, trails and recreational space for the citizens of the City.
This Section does the following: it provides for the protection of existing plant buffers
along the streams and water bodies within the City of Spartanburg; it provides a
standard (the Revegetation Standard) for replanting along streams in order to achieve
effective plant buffers where through human action, the existing buffer is removed and a
violation results; and it provides for the preservation or creation of open space that may
form the basis for the creation of trails or other recreational uses of benefit to the citizens
of the City.
2. Definitions
Note: The following definitions apply specifically to the administration of this Section.
These definitions define important concepts used in this Section, such as the Revegetation
Standard, which is the amount and type of vegetation approximating the natural buffer
found along streams in this area.
Streams means the following identified streams within the corporate limits of the City of
Spartanburg: Lawsons Fork Creek; Fairforest Creek; named tributaries to the above two
streams including Beaverdam Creek; Chinquepin Creek; Holston Creek; Halfway Branch;
Collins Branch; Williams Branch and Greenville Branch as well as all tributaries identified on
the United States Geological Survey (USGS) quadrant maps of the most recent edition. These
maps shall be used to determine the location and extent of the streams covered by this
ordinance.

88
Water body means any body of water associated with the streams within the City as defined
above, including lakes and ponds but not including storm water retention or detention facilities.
Riparian Buffer is an overlay zone that encompasses all land in the City of Spartanburg
(locations are illustrated in Figure 1):
A) within 100 feet on either side of the centerline of Lawsons Fork Creek and Fairforest
Creek, measured as a line extending perpendicularly from the centerline of the stream (see
Figure 2); and
B) within 50 feet on either side of the centerline of all tributaries to Lawsons Fork Creek and
Fairforest Creek, which shall include all streams as defined above and within 50 feet of the
mean water level of all water bodies associated with these streams, measured as a line
extending perpendicularly from the centerline of the stream and the mean water level of the
water body, respectively (see Figure 2).

Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating or filling of land, clearing of
vegetation and any construction, rebuilding, or significant alteration of a structure.
Protected area means any land and vegetation that lies within the riparian buffer, as defined
herein.
Impervious surface means any paved, hardened or structural surface which does not allow for
complete on-site infiltration of precipitation. Such surfaces include but are not limited to

Revegetation Standard means the amount of vegetative cover (trees, shrubs and groundcover)
approximating the natural vegetative state of area along streams in the Upstate area of South
Carolina. When violations of this Section involve land disturbing activities within the Buffer
area then the disturbed area shall be restored to the Revegetation Standard in addition to fines as
contained in Section 501.15.6 Violations. The Revegetation Standard shall also be used to
establish replanting for commercial logging and reforesting under Section 501.15.4 Exceptions
below. The Revegetation Standard shall include: a mixture of deciduous canopy, evergreen trees,
shrubs and ground cover based on the formulas in the following Figures 4a and 4b and Table 1.

Table 1
Revegetation Standard for Riparian Buffer Ordinance
100 foot wide buffer
? 24 caliper inches of canopy/evergreen trees per 100 linear feet of 100 foot wide buffer: this
equals 24  1 inch caliper or 12  2 inch caliper trees;
? 48 shrubs per 100 linear feet of 100 foot wide buffer;
? Groundcover shall cover all ground area not associated with the planting of trees and
shrubs. Groundcover may be sod or grass seed, pots or plugs of suitable native grass or
other groundcover;
? All planting areas shall be mulched.
50 foot wide buffer
? 12 caliper inches of canopy/evergreen trees per 100 linear feet of 50 foot wide buffer: this
equals 12  1 inch caliper or 6  2 inch caliper trees;
? 24 shrubs per 100 linear feet of 100 foot wide buffer;
? Groundcover as above;
? All planting areas shall be mulched.
Diversity:
? A minimum of three (3) species of trees for buffer area; typically each three species should
be present in each 100 linear foot segment of buffer;
? A minimum of three (3) species of shrubs for buffer area; typically each three species
should be present in each 100 linear foot segment of buffer;
? The majority of plants (50% +) must be native species;
? Invasive or trouble prone trees or shrubs (thornless honey locust, Bradford pear, mimosa,
silver maple, red tipped photinia) will not count toward required trees or shrubs.
Size:
? Canopy trees: minimum 1 inch caliper; 8 feet in height;
? Shrubs: minimum 12 inch height and spread or 1 gallon;
? Groundcover: sod, seed, pots or plugs.
Layout:
? Layout shall be flexible and respond to the characteristics of each individual site, but shall:
generally resemble a random and natural placement of plants rather than an ornamental
landscape approach with plants placed in an orderly fashion; trees and shrubs shall
generally be spaced to provide coverage over the entire area of the buffer rather than being
grouped in one portion.
Where the width of the Buffer is some number other than either 100 feet or 50 feet (for
instance, as a result of approval of a Minor or Major Variance), then the Revegetation
Standard shall be reduced proportionally by the same percentage represented by the
reduction in width of the Buffer below 100 feet. In other words, if the Buffer is 75 feet
wide, then this represents 75% of the 100 foot Buffer width. Accordingly, the
Revegetation Standard for a 75 foot wide buffer would be 75% of 24 caliper inches of trees
for every 100 linear feet of Buffer (the Revegetation Standard shall be expressed in whole
numbers rounded up from fractions). Trees shall be a minimum of 1 inch caliper, 8 feet in
height for deciduous canopy trees, and 5 feet in height for evergreen trees when planted.
When existing trees are counted toward the Revegetation Standard, deciduous trees shall

be a minimum of 1 caliper and 8 feet in height, and evergreen trees shall be a minimum of
5 feet in height.
3. District Use and Application: The Riparian Buffer is an overlay zoning district that
encompasses all land within the City of Spartanburg as defined above. The Riparian Buffer
must be maintained in a naturally vegetated state. Any property or portion of property that lies
within the Riparian Buffer is subject to the restrictions of the Riparian Buffer as well as any
and all zoning restrictions that apply to the property.
Note: The Riparian Buffer District is an overlay zoning district, which means that its
requirements overlay (add to) the existing requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for any
piece of property to which it applies. The map in Figure 1 above shows the properties
affected by the Riparian Buffer District. All other requirements of the Zoning Ordinance
are in effect for these properties, in addition to the requirements of the Riparian Buffer
District.
The following land uses are prohibited within the protected area:
(a) any land-disturbing activity;
(b) septic tanks and septic tank drain fields;
(c) buildings, accessory structures, and all types of impervious surfaces;
(d) hazardous or sanitary waste landfills;
(e) receiving areas for toxic or hazardous wastes or other contaminants;
(f) storm water retention and detention facilities, except those built as constructed wetlands
that meet the approval of the Engineering Department of the City of Spartanburg.
4. Exceptions
Note: In order to protect existing property rights, existing uses are grandfathered in
and are not required to meet the requirements of this Section, unless the land use is
proposed to be changed or expanded in some significant way.
Existing commercial logging or agricultural harvesting rights are also protected,
provided that a series of criteria are met that clearly establishes the historic use of the
property for these activities. Also, necessary public uses, such as streets, utility lines,
public access trails, public recreational facilities, and stream bank restoration projects
are also permitted based on appropriate criteria. Existing single family homes are
permitted, regardless of the presence of the Riparian Buffer. New single family homes
are permitted within the Riparian Buffer as well, if there is reasonable justification
provided by the property owner that a home could not otherwise be built on the property
except with the granting of either a Minor or a Major Variance.
The following land uses within the Riparian Buffer area are exempted from the provisions of
this Section:
(a) Existing land uses, except as follows:
(1) When the existing land use, or any building or structure involved in that use, is
enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land; or
(2) When the existing land use, or any building or structure involved in that land use, is
moved to any other portion of the protected area.
If (1) and/or (2) above are met, then all provisions of this Section shall be in effect for
the subject property.

96
(b) Commercial logging or other agricultural harvesting which meet the following criteria:
(I) the property is assessed as agricultural for tax purposes at the time of the enaction
of this ordinance;
(II) the logging or agricultural harvesting practices comply with the best management
practices of the South Carolina Forestry Commission;
(III) All disturbed property within the Riparian Buffer is replanted according to the best
management practices in (II) above, and such that the vegetative cover at the time
of replanting meets or exceeds the tree planting requirements contained in the
Revegetation Standard, above.
(c) Crossings by transportation facilities (for example: streets or roads) and public utility lines,
subject to the width of the buffer being increased by the width of the easement or right of
way where the alignment is less than 60 degrees from the alignment of the stream (see
Figure 5, below);
(d) Public open space except for structures or impervious surfaces (with the exception of those
noted below);
(e) Public use recreational trails or pathways no wider than eight (8) feet, and which are
surfaced with porous or pervious materials; public use recreational trails or pathways
surfaced with impervious materials where the width of the buffer is increased by the width

of the trail or pathway;
(f) Temporary stream, stream bank, and vegetation restoration projects, the goal of which is to
restore the stream or protected area to an ecologically healthy state.
(g) Structures that, by their nature, cannot be located anywhere except within the Riparian
Buffer.
(h) Construction of a new single family residence, providing that:
(1) Based on the size, shape or topography of the property, as of the effective date of this
ordinance, it is not reasonably possible to construct a single family dwelling without
encroaching upon the Riparian Buffer;
(2) The dwelling conforms to all other zoning requirements; and
(3) All applicable requirements of the City of Spartanburg Standards for Stormwater
Management and Sediment Reduction are met;
(4) Approval of either a Minor or Major Variance is granted.
(i) Existing single family homes or other structures (or those portions of structures) which do
not comply with the above exemptions, but which are within the Riparian Buffer area at
the time of the enactment of this Section may in perpetuity be restored to the height, bulk
and placement existing at the time of enactment. Any proposed expansions shall be subject
to the provisions of this Section. Likewise, any uses (roads, streets, parking lots, etc.)
which do not comply with the above exemptions, but which are within the Riparian Buffer
area at the time of the enactment of this Section may in perpetuity be restored to the extent
existing at the time of enactment.
5. Variances
Note: In order to permit flexibility for property owners to utilize their properties for
the uses permitted under the Zoning Ordinance while meeting the intent of the
Riparian Buffer District, two types of variances are permitted. A Minor Variance
may be approved administratively, and permits some flexibility in the width of the
buffer so long as the amount of area covered by the buffer remains the same. A
Major Variance requires approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals and deals with
those situations where there is a legitimate hardship for the property owner based on
unique characteristics of the individual site.
This Section provides for two types of variances: Minor Variances, which are a reduction
in buffer width of up to 25% over a portion of the property in exchange for an increase in
buffer width elsewhere on the same property; and Major Variances, which are a reduction
in buffer width that is not balanced by a corresponding increase in width.
(a) Minor Variances are a reduction in buffer width over a portion of the property in
exchange for an increase in buffer width elsewhere on the same property such that
the average buffer width remains the required width. No Minor Variance can
decrease width by less than 25% of the required width at any point. Minor
Variances may be approved administratively by filing an application with the
Office of Community Enhancement, Planning and Zoning Division if reductions in
the width of the Riparian Buffer on a property are balanced by corresponding
increases in the Riparian Buffer elsewhere on the same property, such that the total
area included in the Riparian Buffer for that property is the same as if it were the
full width across its entire length.

D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
98
(b) Major Variances are reductions in the width of the Riparian Buffer that are not
balanced by a corresponding increase in buffer width elsewhere on the same
property, or a reduction in buffer width of more than 25% of the required width. A
property owner may request a major variance by filing an application with the
Office of Community Enhancement, Planning and Zoning Division to be heard by
the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA), subject to the filing and scheduling
procedures for variances.
(1) Each applicant for a major variance must provide as part of the application
for the variance the following:
(A) Existing features map that meets the requirements of Section
501.13 Site Plan Review of the Zoning Ordinance;
(B) Justification for seeking the variance, including the needs and
purpose of the proposed project;
(C) A proposed mitigation plan that offsets the effects of the proposed

encroachment during site preparation, construction and postconstruction
phases.
(2) In granting a major variance, the BZA will use the following criteria:
(A) The requirements of the Riparian Buffer represent an extreme
hardship for the property owner such that little or no reasonable
economic use of the land is available without reducing the width
of the Riparian Buffer;
(B) The size, shape, or topography of the property, as of the effective
date of the ordinance, is such that it is not possible to construct a
single family dwelling without encroaching upon the Riparian
Buffer.
(3) A Major Variance may be granted subject to a finding by the Board of
Zoning Appeals that:
(A) The width of the Riparian Buffer is reduced only by the minimum
extent necessary to provide relief; and
(B) All land-disturbing activities must comply with the requirements
of the City of Spartanburg Standards for Stormwater Management
and Sediment Reduction and all applicable best management
practices. Such activities shall not impair water quality, as defined
by the federal Clean Water Act and the requirements of the South
Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
(DHEC); and
(C) As a further condition of granting the variance, the City of
Spartanburg Board of Zoning Appeals may require the property
owner to conduct water monitoring downstream from the site of
land-disturbing activities to ensure that water quality is not
impaired.
6. Violations
Violations of this Section shall result in fines as required under the Misdemeanor provision of
the Zoning Ordinance (Section 607, Violations). Each day that the violation continues shall
constitute a separate offense and a separate fine shall be levied. In addition to the above fines,
all violations resulting in land disturbing activities on any area within the Riparian Buffer shall
have that area replanted according to the standards in Revegetation Standard, above.
7. Appeals
Appeals of the Zoning Administrators determination on the enforcement of any of the
provisions of this Section shall be to the Board of Zoning Appeals.

503.1 Purpose.
The purpose of these regulations is to provide minimum control of signs to
promote the health, safety and welfare by:
? Lessening hazards to pedestrians and vehicular traffic;
? Preserving property values;
? Preventing unsightly and detrimental development which has a blighting
influence upon residential, business, and industrial uses;
? Preventing signs from reaching excessive size or numbers such that they
obscure one another to the detriment of all concerned; and
? Securing certain fundamentals of design for the city.

unless the owner agrees in writing to remove the sign if the setback is
required. It shall be understood that if said setback is ever needed, the
value to the sign thereon shall not be included in the computation of the
value of the land being taken for right-of-way purposes. (**)

503.28 Visibility at Intersection. On a corner lot in any residential district, GID,
LOD, LC, B-1, D-T4, D-T5, D-T6, B-3, B-4, I-1, I-2 an Intersection Sight
Distance (ISD) shall be maintained by a triangular area formed by the
right-of-way lines of the intersecting streets and clear line of sight from a
vehicle located 15 feet behind the curb line of the approached street. The
dimensions of the three legs of the sight triangle are dependent upon the
width of the roadway and speed limit. The intersection sight distance and
sight triangle dimensions shall be determined by procedures detailed in the
latest edition of the South Carolina Department of Highways and Public
Transportation Highway Design Manual. No planting, fence or other
structure, or man-made earth mound, or change in earth grade, shall be
placed or maintained if it obstructs vision between a height of two (2) feet
and ten (10) feet above the grade of the intersection. The requirements of
this section shall not be deemed to prohibit any necessary retaining wall.

counted to determine sign area.
5. Signs on a Base Material: When a sign is on a base material
and attached without a frame, such as a wood board or
Plexiglas panel, the dimensions of the base material are to be
used in calculating sign area.
6. Individual Element Signs: When signs are constructed of
individual elements attached to a building wall, the sign area is
determined by calculating the area of an imaginary rectangle
drawn around the sign elements. Sign elements will be
measured as one unit when the distance between the elements

the length of each element. If a painted wall sign is located
closer than two times the length of the painted wall sign and
any other painted wall decoration, then the area of both is
included in the sign area. Visible wall area includes windows
and doors (see Figure 503-7).

example.
The building is a storage warehouse in a B-4 Zoning District. The
permitted sign area can be calculated in two ways - -1) Linear feet
of the front building wall (50) feet) multiplied by a factor of 1.5.
Therefore, the maximum area of a permitted sign is 75 square feet;
2) linear feet of the front lot line (100 feet) multiplied by a factor
of 1.0. The corresponding maximum sign area is 100 square feet.
The maximum sign area may be the greater of the two options.

? 505. TREE PROTECTION AND LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS (*)
505.1 Purpose and Intent.
The purpose and intent of this section is to encourage the preservation and
protection of trees within the City of Spartanburg, and to prevent their unnecessary
destruction. It is not intended to be punitive nor to cause hardship upon those
individuals and concerns exercising reasonable care and diligence to protect these
trees. This section is designed to safeguard public health, safety and welfare, as
well as to prevent air and water pollution, erosion, sedimentation, noise, glare and
excessive heat and to protect and enhance the value of investments, the visual
beauty and the environment in the City of Spartanburg. It is the further intent of
this section to encourage creativity and good practice in design, and flexibility in
the application of the design standards, by placing emphases on the use of a variety
of elements and diverse planting groups to achieve the desired results. These
include large canopy/shade trees, small/understory trees, shrubbery, earth berms,
walls, fences, paving materials, and provision for alternative methods of
compliance.
505.11 Tree Preservation.
This section shall be construed as to encourage the preservation of existing
trees and discourage the unnecessary removal of trees while allowing for
reasonable and economical development of land.
505.2 Definitions.
AGGREGATE EXPANSION. - Any area expansions of a site, building or
building group.
AUTHORITY HORTICULTURAL/LANDSCAPE. - Any individual licensed,
registered, or degreed as capable of providing expert professional service in these
areas of landscape architecture, landscape design or horticulture. (**)
BERM. - Any hill or slope which represents a change of elevation of at least two
feet at a slope of between twenty-five percent and which is covered with an
appropriate stabilizing vegetation.
BUILDING SITE. - That portion of a lot or site on which a principal building
could be erected as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance. This will include an area
not greater than twenty feet outside of the exterior walls of the structure.
BUFFER YARD.  Area of land, improved by landscaping, fences or walls, or
both, designed to mitigate the extent of high-intensity land uses on neighboring
lower-intensity uses.
CALIPER.  The diameter of nursery stock, taken at six inches above ground for
up to and including four inch caliper size and twelve inches above ground for
larger sizes.
* (Amended by Council 7/11/94) ** (Further Amended by Council 10/12/98)
Section 505: Tree Protection and Landscaping Requirements
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
150
DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT  D.B.H.  The accepted measurement of
established trees in the ground is their diameter at D.B.H., measured at 4.5 feet
above grade. To obtain D.B.H., measure the circumference of the tree in inches
with a tape measure, and then divide that number by 3.14 (pi). This will give the
actual diameter in inches.
CIRCUMFERENCE.  For existing trees, the trunk circumferences are measured
at four and one half feet above grade.
DISPLAY AREA OR LOT.  Any unenclosed area used for the display of
merchandise.
GROUND COVER.  Any plant material which serves to prevent soil erosion by
covering large areas of ground, and which does not grow beyond twelve inches in
height.
HIGH INTENSITY COMMERCIAL.  Uses in this category may have some or
all of the following characteristics:
(1.) Large scale and size
(2.) High traffic generation rates (300 or more vehicle trips/1000 square feet gross
floor area)
(3.) Emit significant noise and light
(4.) Extended hour of operation
(5.) Outdoor storage of equipment, materials, and trash
(6.) Generate excessive litter
(7.) Servicing of vehicles and equipment
Many of these uses have significant nuisance effects because of the types of
merchandise sold, most of which require or involve outdoor storage. They are
commonly highway oriented facilities. The servicing of vehicles and equipment
often involves noise, unsightly trash, oil, grease, and dirt, as well as exterior
storage. The food and entertainment uses are ones with late hours of operation,
which often generate excessive litter, traffic, noise, and other neighborhood
concerns such as fast food restaurants and convenience stores.
INDUSTRIAL USES, HEAVY.  Uses which have severe potential for negative
impact on any uses which would locate relatively close to them. This group differs
from light industrial uses in that it includes uses that require unenclosed structures
that are large, tall, and unsightly, such as concrete batching plants. These uses also
have severe potential for generation of odor and may involve large amounts of
exterior storage; because of their scale, they are likely to have a regional impact.
These uses include landing strips and heliports, asphalt or concrete mixing plants,
bulk material or machinery storage (unenclosed), fuel generation plants, grain
elevators, meat packing plants or slaughter houses, resource recovery disposal
facilities; also, any industrial use, including those uses listed below as light
industry, having two-hundred-thousand (200,000) or more square feet of floor area
or more than five-hundred (500) employees on any shift, and all other heavy
industrial uses.

Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
151
INDUSTRIAL USES, LIGHT.  Uses which are generally not objectionable
because of noise, heavy truck traffic, or fumes, or generate nuisances which may
be ameliorated adequately by performance standards. These uses include
boatworks, building material sales or storage yard, bulk materials or machinery
storage, carpet and rug cleaning plants, contractors offices and equipment storage
yards, dry cleaning and laundry plants, dyeing plants, extermination shops, food
processing and packing plants, fuel oil, ice, coal, and wood sales, furniture
cleaning plants, furniture refinishing shops, lumberyards, manufacturing, including
the production, processing, cleaning, testing, and distribution of materials, goods,
foodstuffs, and products in plants with less than two-hundred-thousand (200,000)
square feet of floor area, or fewer than five-hundred (500) employees on every
shift, mini-warehouses or storage facilities, mirror supply and refinishing plants,
publishing plants, scientific laboratories, trade shops, truck terminal, veterinary
offices and kennels, warehouses, wholesale business and storage, and all other
similarly light industrial uses.
INSTITUTIONAL USES.  Uses which are supportive of the residential
community. They provide indoor space for recreation, hobbies, meetings,
education, and worship, as well as cultural facilities, group quarters for religious
groups and the infirm or elderly, and boarding houses. While some uses may be
operated for private profit, they duplicate services that are generally provided by

1. The tree constitutes a public safety hazard;
2. The tree is dead or so damaged or diseased that it may be considered
to be dying;
3. The location of the tree prohibits the ability to reasonably develop or
redevelop the property, either through the conflict of the tree's location

shall be determined to be suitable for planting in paved areas
by a qualified Horticultural/Landscape Authority. Each row
shall terminate with a tree island. In addition, where overlap
occurs between the street frontage and parking lot landscape
areas, duplicative planting shall not be required as long as the
street frontage and parking lot standards are satisfied. Planted
areas in parking lots shall be defined by curbing. The
minimum size for a tree planting island in a parking lot is 8 
0 x 15  0, face to face of curb for single row parking and
8'  0 x 30  0, face to face of curb for double row parking.
No more than twelve (12) single row or twenty-four (24)
double row parking spaces shall be allowed in a continuous
row without being interrupted by a tree island. (**)(***)
3. Parking lots shall also meet the road/street frontage
requirements of Section 505.61 and the buffer requirements of
Section 505.64.
4. Large canopy trees planted in parking lots shall be a minimum
of twelve feet tall having a minimum caliper of two inches. (*)
5. All required planting areas shall be mechanically irrigated.
This shall include all tree islands and all areas of required
frontage landscaping between the parking lot and public
streets. Required planting areas associated with parking lots
containing less than thirty (30) parking spaces are not required
to be irrigated. However, an exterior water source (such as a
hose bib) shall be located within 100 feet of all required
planting areas. (***)

505.63 Service Area Screening Requirements (See Example Page 178) (*)
A. Applicability.  This section shall apply to all service areas to
include but is not necessarily limited to dumpster pads, exposed
non-power fixtures, power utility substations, exposed metal
heating and air-conditioning cabinets over five feet high if they are
on the ground and off-street loading docks. (*)
B. Service Area Screening Requirements. (*)
1. General Requirements.  All service areas shall be shielded
from view from public roads and adjoining property. Such
screening shall be 75% opaque. All service areas shall be
provided with a visual screen consisting of fences, walls,
berms or plant materials or a combination thereof. The
screening shall be at least one foot higher than the item to be
screened but not less than six feet in height and shall extend
along three sides of the service area. All plant materials used
for required screens around service areas shall be of an
evergreen variety. Please Note: If an adjacent building
provides screening on one side of the service area, only two
sides need to be screened or bermed or walled, with a gate
required in front of the service area. The gate shall be opaque
enough to shield from view the interior of the service area.
(*)(**)
2. Fence or Wall Screens.  Fences shall be wood fences and
walls shall be made of split face block, stucco or brick. Under
no circumstances shall a wall be constructed of unfinished
concrete or cinder block. (*)
3. Berm Screens.  Berms shall be a minimum of three feet in
height if other screening materials are used (fences or plant
materials). If no other screening materials are used, the berms
shall be a minimum of six feet in height. The slope of the
berm shall not exceed one foot rise for each two feet of run (2
to 1 slope). Berms with a two to one slope shall be finished
with ground cover plant materials and berms with less slope
may be finished with turf grass (sod.)(*)
4. Plant Material Screens.  Plant materials shall be located in a
3 foot wide bed. In addition, plants shall be spaced as to be
capable of providing a 75% visual opacity and shall be 6 feet
in height within 3 years of initial planting. (*)

505.64 Landscaping Requirements for Buffers. (See Example
Page 167-175
A. Applicability.  The purpose of a buffer is to protect existing low
intensity land uses from being devalued or hurt caused by the
effects of new higher intensity uses. The developer, owner or
tenant of a new higher intensity use is required to install
landscaped buffers adjacent to, but on their side of, common
property lines to protect existing lower-intensity uses. Buffers
shall be required for all developed or redeveloped portions of a
property based on the primary use of the property whether or not
the primary use is located on a specific portion of the property. For
example, a storm water detention pond serving a commercial use
and adjacent to a residential use shall be required to provide a
buffer to the residential use based on the intensity of the primary
commercial use. Buffer requirements for undeveloped portions of
the property may be deferred until development occurs if
sufficient tree or vegetation cover are retained on the undeveloped
portions to visually screen the developed portions of the property
from adjacent uses to the standard required by this Section. (**)
B. Bufferyard Requirements.  To determine the required
bufferyard between two adjacent land uses, the following
procedure shall be followed:
(Refer to Table 505.1 on page 167, and illustrations on pages 168-
175)
1. Identify the proposed land use.
2. Identify the use of land adjacent to the proposed use and
across the street from the proposed use.
3. Determine the bufferyard required for each boundary or
portion thereof on the proposed land use by referring to Table
505.1 entitled Buffered Yard Requirements (p. 167) and the
illustrations on pages 168 through 175, which specify the
design alternative for bufferyards between a proposed use and
the existing adjacent uses across the street. If a zoning lot is a
double frontage lot, (that is a lot that fronts upon two parallel
streets) and its rear yard abuts a residential street, bufferyards
as required by this section shall be provided along all
residential streets that abut lower intensity uses. Street
frontage requirements in Section 505.61 shall apply along
major thoroughfares. (*)
4. The number designation contained in Table 505.1 refers to the
type of bufferyard specified by the illustrations found on pgs.
168-173.
* (Amended by Council 10/12/98) ** (Further Amended by Council 4/8/02)

Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
165
Any of the several options contained in the specific bufferyard
requirements (number) shall satisfy the bufferyard
requirements.
5. The illustration found on pages 168 through 173 specify the
type and quantity of plant materials required by each
bufferyard. The requirements are stated in terms of the width
of the bufferyard and the number of plants required per 100
feet of bufferyard. The requirements of a bufferyard may be
satisfied by any one of the options illustrated. The plant unit
multiplier is a factor by which basic number of plant
materials required for a given bufferyard is determined, given
a change in the width of that yard. Each illustration depicts the
total bufferyard required between two uses. Whenever a wall,
fence or berm is required within a bufferyard, these are shown
on page 174; wherein their respective specifications are also
shown. The wall, fence or berm illustrated in the bufferyard
can be located on either side of the required bufferyard, but
typically shall be located on the highest elevation within the
bufferyard in order to maximize the screening function. The
exact placement of required plants shall be the decision of the
developer except that evergreen (or conifer) plant materials
shall be planted in clusters rather than singly in order to
maximize their chances of survival and that plants shall be
sited utilizing existing and proposed topography to maximize
the screening effect. All bufferyard areas shall be seeded with
lawn grass or suitable ground cover and/or mulch. (*)(***)
6. Plants and trees shall be sufficiently sized to insure buffering
and screening at the time of installation. Where the bufferyard
illustrations indicate a mass or line of plants paralleling the
length of the property line, the plant materials shall be
sufficiently sized to insure obscurity at the time of installation.
However, seedling plants may be used where berms or
structures are required as part of the bufferyard, or where the
proposed use is contiguous to vacant land. See Table 505.2 (p.
164) for specific plant and tree sizes.
7. A proposed land use which is medium intensity commercial,
high intensity commercial, light industrial or heavy industrial
which abuts a single family residential use or multiple family
residential use shall include a brick or stucco wall as part of
the bufferyard. (*)(**)
Under unusual circumstances, the Planning and Zoning
Division of the Office of Community Enhancement may

types of screening such as trees, hedges, earthberms and
fences for the wall requirement. The decision of the Office of
Community Enhancement with respect to screening shall be
subject to review by City Council. (**)
Factors to be considered in relaxation of the wall requirement
include the following:
a. Extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the
particular piece of property;
b. The application of the ordinance to the particular piece of
property would prohibit or unreasonably restrict the
utilization of the property;
c. The relaxation will not be a substantial detriment to
adjacent property or to the public good and the character
of the area will not be harmed by the relaxation of the
requirement.
The following table shall be used for determining minimum plant and tree size in
Bufferyards (*)(**):
TABLE 505.2
Plant Material Type
of Areas
Planting in Bufferyards Abutting
all other fences and berms
Planting in Buffer Areas
Canopy Tree Single

Evergreen Tree 5 feet (height)/(full to ground) 5 feet (height)
Shrub, Deciduous 15 inches (height) 24 inches (height)
Evergreen 12 inches (height) 18 inches (height)
8. The following plant material substitutions shall satisfy the
requirements of this Section:
a. Evergreen canopy or evergreen understory trees may be
substituted as follows:
? In the case of deciduous canopy forest trees, up to
maximum of fifty (50%) percent of the total number
of canopy trees otherwise required;
? Evergreen canopy or evergreen understory trees may
be substituted for deciduous understory trees and
deciduous shrubs, without limitations.
b. In all bufferyards, evergreen or conifer shrubs may be
substituted for deciduous shrubs without limitation.

167
c. Any existing plant material which otherwise satisfies
the requirements of this section may be counted
toward satisfying all such requirements.
9. All fences and walls used as part of the bufferyard
requirements must have a finished side that is facing adjoining
property. The interior side of the fence or wall may be
finished, as the owner deems appropriate.
10. All berms used as a part of the bufferyard requirements may
be located anywhere within the bufferyard provided they
parallel the property line.
11. Buffer Landscaping and Other Landscaping for Patio
Homes and Condominiums. (*)
The developer shall provide landscaping for patio homes and
condominiums. This landscaping is intended to provide
attractive landscaping for each individual lot that benefits the
community as well as the individual lot owner; helps to
mitigate the effect of new, higher density residential
construction when it is adjacent to existing lower density
single family development; allows the developer to respond to
marketing needs and allows for the contingency of selling
individual lots to different builders. A landscaping plan shall
be submitted by the developer that meets the requirements of
Section 505.42 Landscaping Plan Content and shall be
reviewed and approved by the Office of Community
Enhancement. This landscaping plan shall provide for the
following:
a. Frontage landscaping shall be provided in the front yard
setback of each residential lot that at a minimum
contains: 1) one (1) canopy tree; 2) either one (1)
ornamental or understory tree or one (1) large evergreen
shrub; and 3) eight (8) small evergreen and/or flowering
shrubs;
b. Where a patio home development abuts an existing single
family subdivision, the developer of the patio home
development shall install a bufferyard in the rear yards of
those patio homes abutting the existing single family
homes.
This bufferyard may (at the discretion of the developer)
consist of a Bufferyard 2, utilizing a minimum of a ten
foot wide landscape buffer with plant material as shown
in Section 505, or a Bufferyard 3, utilizing a minimum 15
foot wide landscape buffer with a six foot tall opaque
wood fence and a row of canopy trees also as shown in
Section 505.

168
The developer may elect to provide a combination of the
elements in Bufferyards 2 and 3 (for instance, a ten-foot
wide landscape buffer with fence and plant materials.)
The developer may also propose, under the alternate plan
provision in Section 505, other means to arrive at the
same degree of screening of adjacent properties,
including the use of topography and existing plant
materials, or a screening structure other than a fence.
However, in no case shall the bufferyard provided
represent less than the requirements found in Bufferyard
2.
c. Section 505 of the Zoning Ordinance shall be used for
standards for size and type of plant material required
above and construction of the bufferyard structure if
applicable. Existing plant material that meets the
standards of Section 505 may be substituted for any of
the above required plant material.
d. Where a developer chooses to sell individual lots to
builders, then the developer is responsible for installing
any required bufferyard and the builders are responsible
for installing landscaping in the lot frontage areas.
e. All required structures (including fences) and plant
materials in the bufferyard shall be maintained in
perpetuity by the developer and his successors, including
the homeowners association or individual property
owners if there is no homeowners association. The
developer shall be responsible for putting this
requirement in the form of deed restrictions to ensure
that this provision is met.
505.7 Maintenance of Landscaped Areas.
All landscaping required by this section shall be maintained and failure to do so
shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance. The owner shall be responsible for
regular weeding, mowing, fertilizing, irrigating, pruning and any other
maintenance of all plant materials that may be required. Any plant shown on the
landscape plan that dies shall be replaced with another living plant that complies
with the approved landscape plan within 120 days after being notified by the
Building Official.

§ 506. COMMUNICATION TOWERS (*)
506.1 Definitions (**)
In addition to the definitions contained in Section I, ? 108 of the Zoning Ordinance
for the City of Spartanburg, the following definitions shall apply to this Section:
Communication Tower as used in this ordinance means a tower, pole, or
similar structure which supports a telecommunications antenna operated for
commercial purposes above ground in a fixed location, freestanding, guyed, or on
a building.
Telecommunications (as defined in the federal Telecommunications Act of
1996) means the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of
information of the users choosing, without change in the form or content of the
information as sent and received.
Antenna means a device, dish or array used to transmit or receive
telecommunications signals.
Height of a communication tower is the distance from the base of the
communication tower to the top of the communication tower.
Board means the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
Stealth Tower as used in this ordinance means a communication tower
designed and installed in a manner such that the antenna, supporting apparatus and
associated structures are aesthetically and architecturally appropriate with regards
to an existing structure or immediate environment in which the communication
tower is located. Examples include, without limitation, church steeples, bell
towers, flag poles, etc.
506.2 Communications Tower and Antenna Permitted. (***)(****)
506.2.1 Determination by Zoning Administrator. In the B-3, B-4, I-1 and I-2
zoning districts, a communication tower and/or antenna may be permitted by the
Zoning Administrator without further review upon determination that the applicant
has submitted all of the materials required under Section 506.7 (Application
requirements) and all of the applicable requirements and/or conditions in this
ordinance are met. All towers permitted in residential, GID, LOD, LC, B-1, D-T4,
D-T5, and D-T6 zoning districts must be stealth towers approved by special
exception. Co-locations on existing towers or structures, or co-locations,
reconstructions or new construction within the footprints of existing electric

utility company transmission line towers (such as Duke Power Company
transmission line towers) are permitted in all districts and may be permitted by the
Zoning Administrator without further review upon determination that the applicant
has submitted all of the materials required under Section 506.7 (Application
requirements) and all of the applicable requirements and/or conditions in this
ordinance are met. Under no circumstances are communication towers permitted
in locally designated historic districts. New towers permitted on the sites included
in the list of potential sites (Attachments P1 through P5) in the study Analysis
of Potential Sites for Wireless Communication Systems prepared by Comp
Comm Inc. and dated March 15, 1999) may be approved administratively and may
not be required to be stealth towers subject to meeting all applicable requirements
of this ordinance.
Priority in approving additional telecommunications facilities in the City of
Spartanburg shall be given to: first, co-location on existing towers or structures,
including electric utility company transmission line towers; second, reconstruction
of, or new construction within the footprints of existing electric utility company
transmission line towers; third, new construction meeting the requirements of this
ordinance on one of the sites designated as Attachments P1 through P5 in the
Study Spartanburg, SC: Analysis of Potential Sites for Wireless Communications
Systems, prepared by Comp Comm, Inc. and dated March 15, 1999. Only when
these possibilities have been exhausted or when it can be demonstrated by an
applicant that they are not technically feasible to provide adequate coverage for the
City of Spartanburg, or when it can be documented by the applicant that the cost of
the proposed lease for a site or location is more than 20% above the prevailing rate
of leases in comparable Metropolitan Statistical Areas (M.S.A.s) in the Southeast,
shall other sites be considered for approval. The recommendations and attachments
to the above study by Comp Comm, Inc. shall also be used as the basis of the
evaluation of requests for new tower construction.
506.2.2 Time Limit for Determination. Failure of the Zoning Administrator to act
on an application within 45 days from when the application is determined to be
complete, unless extended by agreement, may be considered by applicant to be a
denial of a permit which is subject to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
506.2.3 Co-locations.(*)(**) Co-locations on existing communication towers or
other structures such as existing electric utility company towers (contained in the
list of existing towers and buildings provided in the report Spartanburg, SC:
Analysis of Potential Sites for Wireless Communication Systems prepared by
Comp Comm Inc. and dated March 15, 1999) which do not increase the height of
the existing communication tower or structure are strongly encouraged and may be
permitted without additional review by the Board. Co-locations on existing
electric utility company transmission line towers (such as Duke Power Company
towers) which increase the height of the towers by no more than twenty (20) feet
may be approved administratively. Co-locations, construction of freestanding

185
structures (such as monopoles) which are located within the footprint of the
existing tower or reconstruction of existing towers, any of which increase the
height of the existing tower by more than 20 feet may be approved by special
exception if they do not exceed the total tower height permitted in Section 506.5
below.
All new towers shall be designed to accommodate the principal provider and at
least three (3) additional carriers. New stealth towers shall be designed to
accommodate at least two (2) additional carriers. The City, prior to final approval,
must be satisfied that the tower does make reasonable accommodations for the
additional users. The applicant shall make unused tower space available at fair
market value. All applicants shall make a good faith effort to investigate the
feasibility of co-location. This good faith effort shall be deemed to have occurred
if the applicant satisfies the requirements of Subsection 506.7.7, Alternatives
below.
506.3 General Requirements for All Communication Towers.
Only communication towers meeting the following requirements are permitted,
unless permitted by special exception pursuant to 506.8.1:
506.3.1 Illumination. Except as may be required in Section 506.4, communication
towers shall be illuminated only as required by the Federal communication
Commission (F.C.C.) and/or the Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.).
506.3.2 Color. Communication towers shall not be painted unless otherwise
provided by state or federal regulations.
506.3.3 Signs. A single sign, two (2) square feet in size which included the name
(s) of the company (ies) operating the equipment and a phone number for

§ 513. LARGE TRACT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (*)
513.1 Intent. The intent of the Large Tract Development Overlay District is to establish zoning
standards suitable to the scale of redevelopment on large sites, where potential impacts on the
surrounding community are proportionally greater than those generated by small, individual
parcels and therefore require the application of standards scaled beyond the standards found in
the general districts of the Zoning Ordinance. Further, the intent of the district is to achieve
development which is consistent with the land use goals of the City of Spartanburg, to provide
for a review process which facilitates the development of new sites and the redevelopment of
existing sites and which allows for the flexibility to achieve the best possible development for
each site, both in terms of achieving the sites economic development potential and in terms of
protecting and enhancing the quality of life of the citizens of Spartanburg.
Accordingly, the City Council finds that the application of the standards contained in this
district will help develop the harmonious development of the city, increase the desirability
of residence and investment in the city, increase the opportunity to attain the optimum use
and value of land and improvements, positively effect the stability and value of property,
positively affect the peace, health and welfare of the city, and create a proper relationship
between the taxable value of property and the cost of municipal services.
513.2 Definitions. In addition to the definitions contained in Section 108 of this Zoning
Ordinance, the following definitions shall apply to this Section:
Large Tract Development Site means any site 5 acres or greater in size.
Concurrency Review means the review undertaken by the City of Spartanburg, as part
of the site plan review of large tract development sites to ensure that public facilities and
services needed to support development shall be available concurrently with the
construction of such development. Public facilities and services shall include streets and
roads adjacent to and part of the proposed development, water and sewer systems
necessary to support the development and storm drainage facilities necessary to mitigate
the effects of the development.
Bufferyards means the required landscaped buffer area between the proposed
development and any adjacent land uses.
Developer means the site plan applicant, the owner and their successors and assigns.
Frontage Landscape Area means the required landscaped area along the street frontage
of the development visually separating buildings, parking and vehicular drive areas of the
development from the public right of way.
Traffic Impact Analysis means the required evaluation performed and submitted by the
developer to the City of Spartanburg Traffic Engineer to assess the impact on the existing
street system of traffic generated by the proposed development.
Super Site means any site governed by this overlay district with a total site area 30 acres
or greater as of the date of the enactment of this ordinance.
* (Amended  Added as a New Section by Council 7/24/00)
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
262
Access Management means the management of vehicular access in and out of sites
from public streets and roads. The intent of access management is to reduce traffic
congestion, accidents and loss of street capacity through the intelligent location and design
of public street and driveway connections to the roadway, as well as site design practices
internal to each development site.
Development Ratio means a ratio that is established for any proposed outparcels
abutting the public right of way to govern their number related to the size of the larger site.
The development ratio is governed by the amount of street frontage available for use by
each outparcel.
Created Open Space means open space created as a result of site plan approval on a
site falling under the provisions of this ordinance. Created open space may consist of open
space such as outdoor sitting and eating areas, walkways or bikeways, outdoor recreational
facilities such as playgrounds, open space which provides landscaping significantly in
excess of the amount required by the Zoning Ordinance or open space where aerial utilities
are placed underground. Stormwater detention facilities may be used to achieve this goal if
they are specifically designed as aesthetic amenities.
Areas of Natural Topography and Vegetation means those areas of the site
undisturbed at the time of development which contain significant numbers of existing trees
with a caliper of 12 or greater; areas with significant slopes (topography) and existing
vegetation; areas with existing watercourses; areas including combinations of the above; or
such other natural features as may have a documented horticultural, natural or geologic
significance.
513.3 Applicability. The Large Tract Development Overlay District shall apply to any site that
meets the criteria under 513.5 Site Plan Application Required below.
513.6 Permitted Uses. Any use permitted by right, conditionally or by special exception in the
underlying base district is permitted.
513.5 Site Plan Application Required. A site plan shall be required to be filed for all sites
proposed to be developed or redeveloped which are 5 acres or greater in size (with the
exception of sites for which either a redevelopment plan or a development agreement has
been approved by City Council as of the date of the enactment of this Section) and which
meet one or more of the following criteria:
A. When the contract amount of any site and/or building improvements filed with the
Building Official for which a building permit is required within any two (2) year
period is 50% or more of the current appraised value of the existing site
improvements as ascertained from the County assessors records. Costs for
deferred maintenance or repair shall not be included in the cost of improvements
used to establish applicability of this Section. However, costs necessary to meet
current code requirements shall be included, as well as proposed improvements to
the property. The property owner or developer may alternately submit an appraisal
by an independent appraiser to determine the change in value of the proposed
improvements. The City may review this appraisal utilizing the services of a
second appraiser. In this case, if the two appraisals do not agree, the two
appraisers will select a third appraiser to establish values (*);

case, all existing trees 24 DBH or greater shall be located and described on
the site.
513.52 Process for Administrative Approval. All site plans for sites 5 acres in size or
greater shall be reviewed by the City of Spartanburgs Office of Community
Enhancement for compliance with the provisions of this Section. A site plan filed
under the provisions of this Section and found to be in compliance with the
standards of this Section shall be approved administratively by the Office of
Community Enhancement subject to the following process:
A. Pre-Filing Conference Required. A pre-filing conference between the
developer and staff of the City of Spartanburg (staff of the Office of
Community Enhancement and other relevant City staff) is required at least two
(2) weeks in advance of the formal filing deadline for any site plan filed for
consideration under the provisions of this Section. At this conference the
developer shall present to staff such drawings as have been prepared to meet
the site plan filing requirements. Staff will review them against the site plan
application requirements and return preliminary review comments to the
developer within two (2) working days of the conference. These review

B. Process for Public Information and Input: In order to provide for citizen
access to the site plan review process, the following public process shall be
required for each site plan filed under this Section: (*)
1. Public Information Meeting: After the staff review meeting and before
the Planning Commission Community Forum required in item 2 below, a
Public Information Meeting shall be held, subject to a minimum of 21 days
between the staff review meeting and the Public Information Meeting to
allow for notification by mail of adjacent property owners and property
owners within 300 feet of any boundary of the subject site. Typically,
staff site plan review meetings are held once a week. The intention of the
Public Information Meeting is to provide the adjacent community the
opportunity to receive information about the proposed project and relevant
City requirements from both the developer and city staff prior to the
Community Forum. In order to allow for sufficient time for notification
for both the Public Information Meeting and the Planning Commission
Community Forum there shall be a minimum of 42 days between the staff
review meeting and the Planning Commission Community Forum. (*)
2. Planning Commission Community Forum: Each site plan filed under
this Section shall be presented by Office of Community Enhancement staff
at the first regular Planning Commission meeting after the Public
Information Meeting for the site plan; subject to a minimum of 21 days
between the Public Information Meeting and the Planning Commission
meeting to allow for notification by mail of adjacent property owners and
property owners within 300 feet of any boundary of the subject site. The
intention of this presentation to the Planning Commission is to provide for
citizen comments and questions on the proposed project and for staff to
receive suggestions and requests for plan improvements from the Planning
Commission. (*)
3. Placement on Planning Commission Agenda: Site plans placed on the
Planning Commission agenda will be discussed in accordance with the
procedural rules of the Planning Commission and their Bylaws. Placing
the site plan on the Planning Commission agenda is intended to facilitate
citizen participation in the review procedure. In providing input on site
plans the Planning Commission shall consider how the proposed plan
meets the overall intent and spirit of this Section. (*)
4. Public Input Included in Administrative Review: Site plans presented
to the Planning Commission shall be reviewed administratively after
receiving the above input, suggestions and requests for plan
improvements. Input from this meeting shall be taken into consideration
before finalizing the administrative review of site plans.
5. Suggestions for Plan Improvement Shared with Applicant: Within
five (5) working days of the approval or disapproval of any site plan
governed by these provisions, staff shall notify the developer by letter of
the action taken. Staff suggestions and requests concerning general
development as well as Planning Commission suggestions and requests for
plan improvement shall be included in this letter.

265
6. Written Report to Planning Commission of Plans Approved: At the
next regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting after
administrative approval of a site plan, staff shall provide a written report to
the Planning Commission on the approved plan, including details on
whether the plan was approved as an alternate.
C. Approval of Alternate Plans. The developer may request that the provisions
contained in Sections 513.61.B and 513.62 of this Section be modified by
approval of an alternate site plan. In consideration of an alternate site plan
under this provision, the Zoning Administrator shall consider how the
proposed plan meets the overall intent and spirit of this Section. Consideration
of an alternate scheme under the provisions of this Section is intended to
support the introduction of new materials and techniques and facilitate creative
design solutions that support community goals, but not solely respond to
economic considerations or standard corporate trade practices on the part of a
site plan applicant. In general, a successful alternate plan should prove to be
equal in quality or better than a plan which adheres strictly to the requirements
of this Section. The alternative plan shall contain the following information:
1. It shall explain in detail why the alternative solution is offered, including
referencing the ordinance requirements for which the alternative is
offered, and a written statement and graphic presentation prepared by a
registered landscape architect, architect, engineer, or
horticultural/landscape authority explaining how the alternative meets the
intent and spirit of the ordinance requirements.
2. Include a statement which will be binding upon the developer, that if the
alternative is approved by the Office of Community Enhancement, the
developer will install the alternative as described, or meet the literal terms
of this section within two (2) years.
3. The alternate plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission as
required in Section 513.52.B above.
D. Community Liaison Committee. For each approved site plan for a site
governed by this Section, a community liaison committee shall be formed.
This committee shall consist of five (5) persons as follows: a representative of
the developer; a representative of the Office of Community Enhancement, the
City Council member representing the district within which the project is
located; a representative of the Planning Commission to be selected by the
Chairman of the Planning Commission; and a representative of the closest
adjacent neighborhood association to be selected by the Chair or President of
that neighborhood association. Within thirty (30) days of the site plan
approval the names and telephone numbers of all members shall be provided in
writing to the Manager of the Office of Community Enhancement and the
Manager shall make this list available to all members of the Community
Liaison Committee. The intent of the community liaison committee is to
monitor project progress, provide accurate information about the construction
of the project to the community and to allow representatives of the community
to raise issues about compliance with this Section during construction and for
one (1) year after the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. The
Committee shall meet at regular intervals during this period as decided by the
Committee. At a minimum the Committee shall meet at least once during each
of the following intervals: before the commencement of any demolition,

266
grading or other work related to the implementation of the approved plan;
during the construction of the project; and after completion of construction
within one (1) year of the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. The
developer shall be responsible for providing meeting space, advance
notification of any meetings to Committee members and any notes or minutes
of meetings that the Committee determines to keep. Any questions relating to
compliance with this Section shall be brought to the attention of the Office of
Community Enhancement, which is responsible for ensuring compliance with
the agreement.
513.53 Reduction of Requirements for Redevelopment Sites. A developer may request
a reduction by 25% of the requirements contained in Section 513.62.A. for
bufferyards and frontage landscaping areas for sites which meet the following
criteria: 1), sites for which the proposed use after redevelopment is the same or less
intense (as defined by the Zoning Ordinance) as the primary use currently on the
site; 2) or for vacant sites the same or less intense as the last recorded use (the
County tax assessor's office shall be used as the source for previous use). The 25%
reduction shall be allowed in the width of required bufferyard or frontage area and
the number of trees and shrubs required with all fractions rounded up to the nearest
whole number. Where this reduction would result in less than one canopy tree per
100 linear feet, the reduction in trees shall be taken out of required ornamental
trees. Required fences or walls may not be eliminated or reduced in height. Also,
in no case shall this 25% reduction result in less width or fewer number of plants
than that required by Section 505 of the Zoning Ordinance for the same type of
bufferyard or frontage area. In addition, if a site meets the requirements of this
provision, then the Concurrency Review for Traffic and Roads under Section
513.61.A shall not be required. Also, a site meeting the requirements of this
provision, where existing buildings are retained, is not required to meet Section
513.62.B.3.c., requiring the construction of a recessed loading dock.
513.54 Subdivision Requirements for Large Tract Development Sites: Any site which
is 5 acres or greater in size at the time of the approval of this Section, which meets
the provisions of 513.3 Applicability above, and which is subsequently subdivided,
shall continue to be governed in whole or in part based on the size of the original
site, by the requirements of this Section.
513.6 General Standards for All Large Tract Development Sites. All sites governed by this
Section shall meet the following standards:
513.61 Concurrency Review. As part of the site plan review, the City of Spartanburg
Traffic Engineer shall review the proposed site plan against the following
elements:
A. Traffic and Roads. The City of Spartanburg Traffic Engineer shall review the
proposed development against those standards for levels of service which have
been established by the Department of Public Works for the streets and roads
adjacent to the development site. The purpose of the review is to ensure that
traffic generated by the proposed development can be adequately handled by
the capacity of the existing road system. Highway Capacity Manual level of
service C must be maintained on streets adjacent to the proposed
development and at intersections within one quarter (1/4) mile of the proposed
development. The following traffic generating elements of the proposed
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
267
development shall be analyzed in a traffic impact analysis to determine
whether this level of service can be met: peak hour trip generation; peak
season trip generation and peak direction trip generation. The developer shall
provide a traffic impact analysis when a site is a Super Site or when because
of a proposed change in use or zoning district, complexity, size of the
development or other relevant factors, there is a reasonable possibility that the
level of service as defined above will be decreased below level of service "C"
the City of Spartanburg Traffic Engineer determines that a traffic impact
analysis is necessary.
If a determination is made by the City of Spartanburg Traffic Engineer that the
development does not meet Highway Capacity Manual level of service "C",
then the developer is responsible for adding necessary capacity through
construction and/or implementation of necessary road or transportation
improvements (which may include deceleration lanes, new traffic lights, or
other appropriate improvements) to meet level of service "C." If the
preexisting level of service on adjacent streets and at intersections within one
quarter (1/4) mile of the proposed development is below "C," then the
developer is responsible for adding capacity to ensure that the development
does not further decrease the preexisting level of service. The developer may
also request participation in such infrastructure rebate programs as are offered
by the City or State.
B. Access Management. As part of the concurrency review, the City of
Spartanburg Traffic Engineer shall review all site plan applications for good
access management practices, as defined above. In this review, the standards
of this Section shall be used in addition to the standards of the South Carolina
Department of Transportation (SCDOT).
1. Major Entrance Drive. Along each street frontage, there shall be one
major entrance into the site from the public street, which shall have the
following characteristics: A landscaped entrance drive shall be created
into the site from the street right of way line far enough into the site so
that motorists may reach the parking areas associated with all major
buildings without having to travel through other parking areas. For all
sites where the major entrance drive serves common parking areas of 200
or more parking spaces, the major entrance drive shall extend into the site
for a minimum depth of 100 feet from the street right of way line or the
depth of any outparcels fronting on the street frontage, whichever is
greater. For the first 100 feet into the site from the street right of way line
the entrance drive shall be straight and perpendicular in relation to its
intersection with the public street. At a minimum, for all sites, the
entrance drive shall be straight and perpendicular in relation to the public
street for the depth of the required landscape frontage area. There shall be
no parking spaces, drive aisles or interior streets opening directly onto this
drive within the first 100 feet. Secondary entrance drives shall also have
no parking spaces opening into the drive for the first 100 feet. However,
drive aisles or interior streets may be permitted to intersect the secondary
entrance drive behind the required landscape frontage area based on a
determination by the City of Spartanburg Traffic Engineer that vehicle
movement into and out of the site will not be impaired. Landscaping
requirements for major entrance drives are provided in Section
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District

513.62.A.2.c. below. Figure 1 (on page 248) graphically shows an
example of possible configuration of the Major Entrance Drive as
discussed above. (*)
2. Secondary Entrances Permitted. Additional secondary site
entrances may be permitted in the interest of good traffic operation as
determined by the City of Spartanburg Traffic Engineer:
a. Number Permitted. One (1) additional entrance may be
permitted along a continuous site frontage in excess of 300
feet or two (2) additional entrances along a continuous site
frontage in excess of 800 feet;
b. Corner Clearance. The minimum distance that shall be
permitted between an entrance and the corner of an
intersection shall be based on the following formula:
Site Frontage Distance from
Intersection
0 feet to 200 feet 75 feet
201 feet to 600 feet 150 feet
c. Entrance Spacing. The minimum spacing between all
entrances shall be as follows:
Speed Limit Spacing Center to Center
30 mph or less 150 feet
40 mph or more 250 feet
d. Proximity to Property Line. In no case shall any site
entrance or driveway be located closer than twenty (20) feet to
a property line.
e. Entrances to Outparcels. There shall be no entrances onto a
public street directly from individual outparcels. Entrances
from individual outparcels onto internal major or secondary
entrance drives shall meet the standards of SCDOT for
number, corner clearance, spacing and proximity to property
line.
3. No Vehicular Entrances Permitted Into Neighborhoods. There
shall be no vehicular access to residential streets (defined under
Residence District, Section 56-5-530 of the South Carolina Code of
Laws) that are adjacent to commercial or industrial uses on sites
governed by this Section unless site access is only possible through
such streets. In such a case, the City of Spartanburg Traffic Engineer
shall require and the developer shall install such traffic mitigation or
control measures (such as nubs, diverters, paved crosswalks, traffic or
pedestrian signals etc.) as deemed necessary by the City of
Spartanburg Traffic Engineer in order to minimize the impact of
traffic on adjacent neighborhoods and provide for safe and pleasant
conditions for motorists and pedestrians on residential streets.

269
4. Interior Driveways and Parking. Interior driveways and parking
for all sites governed by this Section shall meet the requirements of
Section 504 Regulations for Off-Street Parking and Loading, and
Section 505.62 Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements unless
specifically stated otherwise below.
C. Storm Water Management, Water and Sanitary Sewer. The City Engineer
shall review the proposed development against those standards for levels of
service which have been established for these utilities. All development shall
meet or exceed the standards of the City of Spartanburg Standards for Storm
Water Management and Sediment Reduction. The developer shall
demonstrate that the capacity of the existing sanitary sewer collection system
has adequate hydraulic capacity to handle the wastewater generated from the
site, and if not, explain what provisions will be made to improve the existing
system. The developer shall also demonstrate that the existing water supply
system has adequate capacity to meet peak hourly demands and fire flows
while maintaining acceptable water pressure. The developer is responsible for
demonstrating that existing levels of service established by the City Engineer
are met and is responsible for installing necessary improvements to ensure that
the service standards are maintained.
D. Timing of Infrastructure Improvements. All improvements required under
Section 513.61 Concurrency Review shall be constructed before the issuance
of the Certificate of Occupancy.
513.62 Site Design Standards
A. Landscaping. In order to respond to the proportionally greater impacts of
large-scale development on surrounding uses, particularly residential
neighborhoods, certain landscaping requirements of the zoning ordinance shall
be increased proportionally in respect to the size of the site. All landscaping
must meet the requirements of Section 505 Tree Protection and Landscaping
Requirements unless as otherwise noted below.
All plant materials required by this Section shall meet the following minimum
size requirements: canopy trees: 2 inch minimum caliper and 12 feet
minimum height; understory or ornamental trees: 1 ½ inch minimum caliper
and 8 feet minimum height; evergreen trees: 6 to 8 feet in height; shrubs: 24
inch minimum height or 3 gallon minimum size. A minimum of 3 feet of soil
depth shall be provided for all planting areas required by this Section. All
plant materials required by this Section shall be allowed to mature to the form
and size dictated by their function (for example, if a plant (such as a crepe
myrtle) is installed to meet a requirement for a canopy or understory tree, it
shall not be pruned to the extent that it no longer functions as a tree).
1. Bufferyards. Requirements for bufferyards shall be based on site size
as a multiplier with 5 acres the minimum site size and increasing
proportionally with the increasing size of the site and the intensity of
the proposed use relative to existing adjacent uses. At a minimum, a
Base Bufferyard (Bufferyard 0) shall be required for any proposed site
plan regardless of the proposed uses or the size of the development site
and regardless of the existing uses on adjacent sites. To the extent

270
possible existing topography within the designated bufferyard area
shall be preserved, including existing trees. The preservation of
existing, healthy trees is strongly encouraged and tree credits may be
claimed as per Section 505.55 of the Zoning Ordinance for any trees
preserved equal to or larger than 4 inches in caliper. The creation of
screening topography (berms) in addition to those required is also
encouraged. No buildings, roadways or access drives, loading or truck
maneuvering areas serving the proposed development shall be
permitted in the buffer area. The following Table 2 provides
bufferyard requirements based on site size. Requirements given for
sites under 5 acres are taken from Section 505, Tree Protection and
Landscaping Requirements. In order to determine bufferyard
requirements for a particular site: 1), determine the bufferyard type
based on Table 1; 2) find the required bufferyard on Table 2); using
the site size, find the specific bufferyard requirements (see the next
two tables).

? (From Table 2) Trees shall be a mixture of canopy deciduous trees (such as red maples and oaks) and large evergreen trees (such as
pines, southern magnolias and American hollies) unless otherwise specified. Shrubs shall be evergreen shrubs that shall reach a
minimum height of 6 to 8 feet (such as burford holly, ligustrum, carolina cherry laurel, osmanthus). Number of trees and/or plants
specified shall be per 100 lineal feet of bufferyard. The following ratios are taken from Section 505 of the Zoning Ordinance:
(Bufferyard 1) 20 plants (2 canopy trees, 5 understory trees, 5 evergreen trees and 8 shrubs per 100 lineal feet of bufferyard);
(Bufferyard 2) 39 plants (5 canopy trees, 10 understory trees, 9 evergreen trees and 15 shrubs). Trees and shrubs shall meet the
minimum height and size requirements of Section 513.62.A above at time of installation.
?? (From Table 2) Required fences and walls shall be placed at the point in the bufferyard highest in elevation relative to the adjacent
properties in order to maximize the screening effect of the fence or wall. Fences and walls shall be constructed of materials as required
in Section 505.63.B.1. All fences and wall shall have a finished side facing adjoining property.
??? (From Table 2) The increase in elevation relative to the adjacent property may be accomplished by the construction of an earth berm
or may result from existing topography within the bufferyard area. A reduction from the minimum width of 100 feet may be considered
on a case by case basis if the increase in elevation is increased by another 4 feet for every 10 feet reduction in width. Berms shall have
a maximum slope of 3 to 1. Also, if a service road or loading area is adjacent to the buffer, the vertical distance from the road to the top
of the masonry wall should be at least 12 feet in order to adequately screen trucks and loading activities from adjacent dwellings.
However, in no case shall the buffer be reduced less than 80 feet and any decrease in width shall be evaluated carefully with increases in
the quality of the bufferyard (for example, through the installation of an irrigation system) used as the basis for a decision along with
characteristics of individual sites. When the minimum 4 foot high berm is not provided as described above, then the width of the
bufferyard shall be increased to 125 feet. Up to a total of 4 of the required trees per 100 linear feet may be replaced by: either evergreen
or canopy tree seedlings at the minimum ratio of 50 seedlings for every such tree to be replaced or evergreen shrubs at a minimum ratio
of 5 shrubs for every such tree to be replaced.

Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
272
a. Bufferyard Required Where Proposed Use is Adjacent to
Vacant Property. Where a proposed use is adjacent to vacant or
undeveloped property the following process shall be followed in
order to ensure the appropriate separation over time between uses
of different intensity: 1), in all cases a minimum of a base
bufferyard (Bufferyard 0) shall be installed; 2), compute the
bufferyard requirement based on the most intensive use permitted
under the current zoning on the adjacent vacant tract; 3), where a
required buffer area based on this computation is a bufferyard 3
or greater, then in addition to the base bufferyard the minimum
required width of this bufferyard shall be reserved as property
undeveloped with any permanent structures (such as buildings,
parking areas, driveways, loading, storage or maneuvering areas,
etc.) which would preclude the eventual installation of the
required bufferyard improvements; 4), bufferyard improvements
including trees, shrubs (in excess of the Bufferyard 0 above) and
any fences or walls shall be constructed when the adjacent uses
are built. The improvements shall be installed before the
approval of a final subdivision plat for the adjacent property by
the Planning Commission or the issuance of the first Certificate
of Occupancy for structures on the adjacent property, whichever
comes first. A performance bond shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator for the cost of these additional improvements
before the certificate of occupancy for the proposed use is issued;
the bond shall be released if the improvements are installed
before the approval of a final subdivision plat for the adjacent
property by the Planning Commission or the issuance of the first
Certificate of Occupancy for structures on the adjacent property,
whichever comes first.
Alternately, a developer may choose to install a bufferyard based
on 2) above with a 25% reduction allowed for width of
bufferyard and number of trees and shrubs. The 25% reduction
shall be allowed in the width of bufferyard and number of trees
and shrubs required with all fractions rounded up to the nearest
whole number. In no case may required fences or walls be
eliminated or reduced in height. Also, in no case shall the above
25% reduction result in less width or fewer numbers of plants
than required by Section 505 of the Zoning Ordinance for the
same type of bufferyard.
b. Bufferyard O Required Where Proposed Use is Adjacent to
Unincorporated Property. Where a proposed use on a site
governed by this Section is adjacent to unincorporated property
(property not within the city limits of the City of Spartanburg),
the Base Bufferyard (O) as described in Table 2 shall be installed
by the developer regardless of the use on the unincorporated
property.
c. Graphic Illustration of Bufferyard Types. Figure 2 graphically
displays the bufferyards described in Tables 1 and 2. Placement
of plants is intended to be illustrative and not represent a required

273
placement.
2. Frontage Landscaping Areas All sites governed by the provisions of
this Section with property lines abutting the public right of way are
required to provide landscaping along the street frontage. If the
existing use on the opposite side of the public right of way from the
proposed use is the same or more intense than the proposed use, then
the frontage requirements from Table 3 below shall apply to the
proposed use. If the existing use on the opposite side of the public
right of way is less intense than the proposed use, than bufferyard
requirements shall apply (see Section 513.62.A.3 below).
Requirements for frontage landscape areas shall be based on site size
as a multiplier with 5 acres as the minimum site size and with
requirements increasing proportionally as the size of the site increases.
To the extent possible existing topography within the designated
bufferyard area shall be preserved, including existing trees. The
preservation of existing, healthy trees is strongly encouraged and tree
credits may be claimed as per Section 505.55 of the Zoning Ordinance
for any trees preserved equal to or larger than 4 inches in caliper. The
following Table 3 contains these requirements and Figure 3
graphically illustrates them:
Table 3. Frontage Landscape Areas
Size of Site Width of Frontage
Landscape Area (?)
Number of Plants Per 100 Feet of
Frontage
Up to 4.99 Acres Minimum 10 Feet Minimum 1 canopy tree;
2 ornamental trees; 4 Shrubs
5 to 9.99 Acres Minimum 20 Feet Minimum 1 canopy tree;
3 ornamental trees; 6 shrubs
10 to 19.99 Acres Minimum 30 Feet Minimum 2 canopy trees;

5 ornamental trees; 10 shrubs
30 Acres and Above
Super Sites
Minimum 30 Feet Minimum 3 canopy trees;
6 ornamental trees; 12 shrubs
? Measured from the street set back line into the interior of the site.
a. Pedestrian Walkway. In addition to the above
requirements, a pedestrian walkway shall be constructed by
the developer in the frontage landscape area when it is
determined by the City of Spartanburg Traffic Engineer to be
necessary in order to provide for safe and convenient
pedestrian movement from site to site. This pedestrian
walkway shall run the length of each street frontage and
shall be uninterrupted except by drive entrances into the site.
The walkway shall consist of permanent material such as
poured in place asphalt or concrete, brick or concrete unit
pavers. The continuing maintenance of this walkway is the
responsibility of the property owner, unless the walkway is
in the public right of way, in which case the City of
Spartanburg shall be responsible for its maintenance.

Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
274
b. Screening Element. Where internal drives and/or parking
are located immediately behind the frontage landscaped area,
screening elements to help screen these vehicular areas from
the street shall be installed by the developer. (Those
portions of vehicle dealerships (including automobile, truck,
tractor, recreational vehicle and boat dealerships) which are
used for permanent display shall be exempted from this
screening requirement.) One or a combination of the
following shall be installed within the frontage landscaped
area to result in a height of 3 feet above the final grade of the
parking and/or drive area behind the frontage area; an earth
berm; a brick or masonry wall; or a continuous hedge made
of evergreen shrubs. Where the finished grade of the
internal drives and/or parking immediately behind the
frontage landscape area results in a grade 3 feet or more
lower than the finished grade of the street immediately in
front of the frontage landscape area, then no screening
element shall be required. Required shrubs as per Table 3.
above may be counted toward the screening element
requirement.
c. Landscaped Major Entrance Drive. The following
requirements shall be met for major entrance drives from the
public right of way as described in Section 513.61.B Access
Management above.
Except where drive aisles or interior streets intersect the
entrance drive, there shall be a landscaped area on either side
of the entrance drive with a minimum width of 10 feet,
planted with grass or suitable ground cover and with canopy
trees. The minimum spacing shall be one (1) canopy tree
planted on each side of the entrance drive for every 30 feet
(or fraction thereof) of length of the entrance drive behind
the required landscape frontage area, excluding drive
entrances into the entrance drive. Ornamental trees may be
substituted for canopy trees along this entrance drive at the
ratio of 2 ornamental trees for 1 canopy tree.
3. Applicability of Bufferyard and Frontage Requirements. The
following process shall be used to determine the applicability of
bufferyard or frontage requirements where a proposed use on a site
governed by this Section abuts a public right of way: 1), identify the
proposed use and the existing use across the right of way and
determine from Table 1 the appropriate bufferyard; 2) where a
Bufferyard 0 applies then the frontage requirements shall apply (then
consult Table 3 to determine the frontage requirements based on site
size); 3), where a Bufferyard 1 or greater applies then the Bufferyard
requirements shall apply (then consult Table 2 to determine the
required bufferyard requirements based on site size).
a. Reduction in width and number of plants permitted.
Where a bufferyard 1, 2 or 3 is required adjacent to the public
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
275
right of way, the width of bufferyard and the number of trees
and shrubs may be reduced by 25% in consideration of the
presence of the right of way between the proposed and
existing uses. The 25% reduction shall be allowed in the
width and number of trees and shrubs required with all
fractions rounded up to the nearest whole number. This
reduction shall not be in addition to any reduction permitted
under Section 513.53, Reduction of Requirements for
Redevelopment Sites, or 513.62.A.1. Bufferyards above. In
any case, this reduction may not result in a width less than
would be required on the same size site for frontage
landscaping as shown in Table 3 above. If the bufferyard
width requirement (from Table 2) before the reduction is
already less than the frontage requirement for the same size
site (from Table 3), then no reduction in width shall be
permitted. Required fences or walls may not be eliminated or
reduced in height except as permitted under 3.b. below.
b. Modification of fence or wall requirement for institutional
uses. In recognition of the need for security and visibility
from the right of way for institutional and public uses, where
an institutional or public use as listed in Section 303.5.B of the
Zoning Ordinance, is proposed adjacent to a public right of
way, the Office of Community Enhancement may modify the
bufferyard requirement for a fence or wall as follows: in lieu
of a required fence or masonry wall, a permanent decorative
structure such as a wrought iron style fence may be substituted
which permits visibility into the site while providing security
at the perimeter of the site and enhancing the appearance of
the site; or the required screening element for parking under
Section 513.62.A.2.b. may be substituted for a required fence
or wall if it provides a change in elevation equal to the fence
or wall's height. Alternately, a required fence or wall in a
bufferyard next to a public right of way may be eliminated if
the developer elects to forgo the permitted 25% reduction in
bufferyard width permitted for proposed uses adjacent to the
public right of way. In order to be considered by staff, the
proposed substitution must first be presented to the Planning
Commission as part of the Process for Public Information and
Input (Section 513.52.13 of this ordinance). In no case shall
the required screening element for parking be eliminated
where parking and/or drive ways are adjacent to the frontage
landscape area, nor shall a required fence or wall be
eliminated adjacent to a loading, trash storage or truck
maneuvering area if the loading, trash storage or truck
maneuvering area is adjacent to or faces the public right of
way.
c. Frontage landscape area required across a public right of
way from unincorporated property. Where a proposed use
on a site governed by this Section is on the opposite side of a
public right of way from unincorporated property then
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,

276
frontage requirements from Table 3 shall apply regardless of
the intensity of the existing use on the unincorporated
property.
4. Landscaping of Storm Water Detention Ponds. Above ground
stormwater detention or management facilities shall be designed to be
integrated aesthetically into the overall design of the entire site, and
shall relate sympathetically to surrounding land uses, particularly
residential neighborhoods. At a minimum, this shall be accomplished
by meeting the following requirements:
a. Where construction of such facilities results in the removal of
existing trees over 12 in caliper, any trees removed shall be
replaced on a one for one basis and may count toward the
landscaping requirement in 3.c. below.
b. Such facilities may be utilized to meet the buffer requirement
if they meet the requirements of this Section.
c. Such facilities shall be landscaped with a mixture of canopy
and evergreen trees (spaced a minimum of 30 feet apart
around the perimeter of the sediment pond).
d. The interior slopes of all detention ponds shall be planted with
turf grass (sod) or other suitable ground cover or shall be lined
with a permanent material such as concrete as approved by the
City Engineer.
B. General Site Design Standards. The following standards shall apply to
all sites governed by the provisions of this Section.
1. Sign Standards All signs for sites governed by this ordinance shall
meet the provisions of Section 503, Sign Regulations of the Zoning
Ordinance, except that:
a. For sites within Office, Institutional, Business, and Industrial
Districts: One project identification sign is permitted along
each street frontage, including the project name, logo and
address as well as tenant names and trademarks or logos.
Project identification signs shall be no greater than 35 feet in
height. Signs for outparcels which have frontage along streets
are permitted adjacent to the street, on the basis of one sign for
each street which an outparcel has frontage on. Signs for
outparcels shall be monument style signs, limited to a total
height (including base) of 10 feet.
b. For sites in all Districts, where possible, building mounted
signs (including but not limited to signs for individual tenants
or businesses), shall be designed to be integral to and
complement the architecture of the building facades (such as
sign bands, village style projecting signs, awning signage,
etc.) in order to create unity for the project and reduce clutter
and confusion.
2. Site Lighting All external lighting fixtures on a site governed by this
Section (including commercial parking lot lighting and building
mounted lighting) shall be designed and located so as to reflect light
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
277
away from adjacent properties and away from required buffer areas.
All lighting fixtures governed by this provision shall meet the
following requirements:
a. The light source (lamp) shall be concealed within an opaque housing
and shall not be visible from adjacent properties;
b. Fixtures must be mounted in such a manner that the cone of light from
the light source does not cross any property line of the site.
3. Screening of Loading and Trash Storage (Dumpster) Areas.
Loading and/or trash storage areas (including truck backing and
maneuvering areas) are strongly encouraged to be located on the
opposite sides of buildings or sites away from adjacent properties with
less intense uses, particularly residential properties. If loading and/or
trash storage areas are so located, then the requirements for screening
in Section 504 Regulations for Off-Street Parking and Loading and
505 Tree Protection and Landscaping Requirements shall be met.
Where a loading and/or trash area is within 200 feet of the property
line of any adjacent property (unless the loading and/or trash area is
completely screened from the adjacent property by a building mass)
and where a bufferyard 3 or greater is required, in order to provide
effective acoustic and visual screening the following requirements
shall be met:
a. All loading docks and trash storage areas shall be screened by a
masonry wall a minimum of eight feet in height (measured from
the finished grade of the loading and trash storage area) located
adjacent to the loading dock and trash storage area and between
them and the adjacent property to be screened. This wall may be
incorporated with a required bufferyard wall if appropriate. Also,
a combination of earth berm and wall which combined achieve a
minimum height of eight feet may be used to meet this
requirement.
b. The loading and/or trash storage areas (including truck backing
and maneuvering areas) shall also be screened from any adjacent
residential properties by a continuous row of evergreen plantings
of a type which will attain a minimum height of ten feet within 3
years of planting (such as leyland cypress, eastern red cedar, foster
holly, American holly, etc). Trees required to meet a bufferyard
requirement may be utilized to meet this requirement.
c. In addition, in order to provide for acoustical screening at the
source of noise originating from large loading facilities, loading
docks for any buildings or tenant lease spaces greater than 75,000
square feet in total floor area shall be screened by recessing the
base of the loading dock below grade and adding a masonry,
concrete or concrete block wall immediately next to the dock and
storage area, so that the top of the wall is at least as high as a
typical truck when it is placed at the dock (typically at least 10 feet
high) and which extends out from the side of the building at least
the length of a typical tractor trailer rig. This wall shall be
required in addition to any wall required as part of a bufferyard
requirement.
d. The loading and/or trash storage areas (including truck backing
and maneuvering areas and any service or access roads providing
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
278
access to loading and/or trash storage areas) shall not be located
within the bufferyard areas.
4. Architectural Scale and Detailing In order to mitigate the negative
effect of large monolithic structures with undifferentiated architecture,
in order to create a positive, human scale appropriate both to
pedestrian use and to surrounding residential areas and other less
intense uses, to enhance the economic health of the city through the
construction of long lasting structures made of durable materials, and
in order to create a positive image of the City of Spartanburg through
design excellence, the architecture of buildings on development sites
governed by this Section shall include the exterior use of materials
such as brick and other masonry products, architectural detailing,
varied roof lines and window areas where appropriate at the first floor
level.
a. Criteria for Approval: All buildings in the proposed
development shall incorporate the following requirements:
1. Exterior materials shall be durable and of high quality.
Brick, stone, cast stone, high quality pre cast concrete
block such as decorative concrete block or split block are
encouraged, particularly facing public areas (including
customer, tenant and public parking areas and the public
right of way). Non-durable materials such as thin layer
synthetic stucco products shall not be used within 8 feet
of ground level unless specially reinforced or located
away from pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic.
2. The roofline of building facades which face public areas
(including customer, tenant and public parking areas and
the public right of way) shall be designed to include
treatments such as pitched roofs, gables, chimneys or
raised features in order to provide interest and avoid the
monotony of undifferentiated rooflines.
3. All facades of all buildings in the proposed development
facing public areas (including customer, tenant and public
parking areas and the public right of way) shall include
architectural details such as banding, base elements,
cornice lines, decorative bays, balconies, column
treatments, pedestrian arcades, decorative window
treatments and/or architectural fenestration intended to
relieve blank and undifferentiated facades. Long facades
shall be varied by the use of setbacks or other
articulation. Rear and side facades shall be designed to
be compatible in color, materials and detailing with the
public facing facades.
4. All rooftop equipment shall be screened from pedestrian
view from adjacent right of ways and neighboring
properties using durable architectural materials
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
279
compatible with the building's exterior.
5. New construction on sites governed by this ordinance
shall respect the scale and character of adjacent uses
(particularly less intense uses) in order to achieve a
development that is compatible with surrounding streets
and adjacent uses, is integrated with the physical
character of the existing community and contributes to it
in a positive way. This shall be accomplished through
building scale and siting that: provides for a relationship
of building heights to adjacent uses; includes attention to
the preservation of views from adjacent properties; does
not create dramatic changes in elevation relative to
adjacent properties without also mitigating those changes
in elevation; and by the choice of façade materials and
architectural detailing which relates to existing adjacent
development and which helps to minimize the apparent
size and bulk of new buildings. Where new construction
includes increases in elevation above the existing grade
created by grading or earthmoving on the site and results
in height which is higher in elevation than the existing
adjacent streets, then additional landscaping, terracing or
berming may be required in the bufferyard areas adjacent
to that portion of the new construction which is higher
than the adjacent streets in order to effectively screen the
new construction. Architectural treatment of proposed
retaining walls over six (6) feet in height is required in
order to visually break up the mass of the wall. This shall
be accomplished by the use of durable architectural
materials such as precast concrete block, brick or similar
products and the creation of terraces and setbacks of
varied depth.
6. In addition, the following shall be required:
A. A minimum of 60% of all of the exterior first floor
facades of all buildings containing institutional,
commercial, office, and industrial uses (as listed in
Section 303.5 of the Zoning Ordinance) in the
proposed development which face public areas
(including customer, tenant and public parking areas
and the public right of way) shall be constructed of
brick, stone, cast stone, or masonry products such as
split block or decorative concrete unit blocks
(untreated or painted concrete block or thin layer
synthetic stucco shall not count toward this
requirement).
B. Weather protection for pedestrians in the form of
pedestrian arcades, awnings or appropriate
architectural treatment shall be provided for those
portions of the first floor facades of all buildings in
the proposed development containing commercial
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District

D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
280
and/or office uses as listed in Section 303.5 of the
Zoning Ordinance and facing areas where there is
intended to be pedestrian use and access to buildings
(including customer, tenant and public parking areas,
sidewalks adjacent to buildings and pedestrian
entrances).
C. A minimum of 33% of the total surface area of the
first floor façades which face public areas (including
customer, tenant and public parking areas and the
public right of way) of each tenant lease space of all
commercial and office uses (as listed in Section 303.5
of the Zoning Ordinance) in the proposed
development shall consist of windows and/or doors.
Façade area used for windows and doors may be
included in the 60% façade materials requirement in
A. above.
b. Alternate Approval Process: The developer may request that
the requirements of Section 513.62.B.4 Architectural Scale
and Detailing be modified by approval of an alternate scheme
in conformance with Section 513.52.C Approval of Alternate
Plans. In addition to the requirements of Section 513.52.C,
the alternate scheme shall contain the following:
i. A written justification explaining in detail how the
proposal meets the spirit and intent of Section
513.52.C and 513.62.B.4.
ii. Provide colored elevations to scale of the proposed
building facades and samples of proposed
materials.
iii. A written justification of the proposal based on the
functional requirements of the building uses (for
example: modification of window requirement is
based on a functional requirement relating to
building use) as well as a justification of materials
choices based on their functional use (for example:
façade materials chosen at ground level will
withstand normal impacts from pedestrians).
iv. Above requirements i through iii to be provided for
the required presentation to Planning Commission
in Section 513.52.B above.
5. Pedestrian Amenities. It is strongly encouraged that each project
include areas for outside use, including outside sitting or walking
areas, play areas, outdoor dining areas associated with restaurants,
coffee shops, or fast food restaurants, etc.
6. Development Ratio. A development ratio is required for any
proposed outparcels with street frontage which governs their number
related to the size of the larger site. This development ratio is
determined by the amount of street frontage available for use by
outparcels. No more than one outparcel along any street shall be
permitted for each 200 feet of continuous street frontage on that street,
Section 513: Large Tract Development Overlay District
Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
281
after all drive entrances on such frontage have been subtracted out.
There must be at least 200 feet of street frontage on any given street to
support each outparcel on that street. The following examples are
provided as illustrations of this ratio: for instance, if there are 235 feet
of street frontage, only one outparcel shall be permitted, and if there
are 420 feet of site frontage, then two outparcels will be permitted.
Outparcels on the interior of the site with no street frontage are not
governed by this requirement.
513.7 Standards for Super Sites The following standards shall apply to any sites 30 acres and
above which are governed by this Section, in addition to the standards given above.
A. Requirements for Preservation of Natural Topography and Vegetation
and Provision of Created Open Space. The development of large tracts of
land typically removes a large proportion of the natural topography and
vegetation of the property and decreases open space within the community.
Therefore, it is the intent of this Section to provide standards designed to help
mitigate the loss of open space to the community from large sites by, where
possible, preserving natural topography and vegetation and creating new open
space (see Section 513.2, Definitions).
1. Percentage of Site Area. When reviewing proposals on Super Sites,
staff shall utilize the following standards to achieve the intent of this
provision: A total of ten percent (10%) of the total site area shall be either
kept in its natural state in order to preserve areas of natural topography
and vegetation or shall result in created open space so that the total of
significant natural topography and vegetation retained and created open
space totals ten percent of the total site area excluding any area in public
right of way. That portion of required bufferyards that preserve existing
topography and vegetation may be used to satisfy this requirement.
B. Undergrounding of Utilities. In order to enhance the aesthetic character of
major traffic corridors and provide a positive image of the City of
Spartanburg, applicants are strongly encouraged to place underground all
aerial utility wires along the street frontages and margins of a site.
C. Parking Ratio In order to reduce the amount of impervious surface created
by the development or redevelopment of large tracts of land, the required
parking ratio for retail uses on sites governed by this Section may be reduced
to 4 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area.

§ 514 TATTOO & BODY PIERCING FACILITIES (*) (**)
514.1 Intent (**)
The intent of this ordinance is to regulate tattoo and body piercing facilities
within the City of Spartanburg in order to protect the public health, safety,
morals and general welfare and to guard against the inception and transmission
of disease. The City Council finds that stringent regulations governing
tattooing and body piercing can minimize the disease risk and therefore protect
the general health and welfare of the community.

DOWNTOWN CODE **
Spartanburg, SC
307
* Revision Date 11-12-2010
** Amended  Added Section 515, Downtown Code, to City Zoning Ordinance 9/24/12
To Be Inserted as Section 515 in the Zoning Ordinance
USERS GUIDE
The Spartanburg Downtown Code serves to condense and replace the existing medley of districts in the Zoning
Ordinance and on the Zoning Map. To that end, the downtown area should be zoned in a manner that is both
consistent with the Downtown Plan, but permits some flexibility in varying the ideas set forth in it.
Users of this document will notice that this Downtown Code has been ordered in a manner that addresses the
standards for the most public realm, the street, to the most private realm, the building. As a design becomes
more detailed and moves from the subdivision plan to the site plan to the building elevation, users are
encouraged to progress through the document.
The guiding principle of this Downtown Code is that the use of the property, while important, is subordinate to the
design of the building within which it is contained. This encourages visual compatibility while permitting mixed
uses in close proximity to each another.
515.1 PURPOSE & INTENT
The purpose of this code is to implement the vision and goals of the Downtown Master Plan. These
regulations are designed to permit the development and redevelopment of the central business district
and its immediate surroundings. The intent is to accommodate mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly buildings
and public spaces in the downtown that over time will evolve into areas allowing people to live, work,
shop, gather, worship, and other public events.
This code attaches the same or greater level of importance to the overall building design as is placed
on the uses within the building in order to create a convenient and attractive community. Buildings
added to Downtown should contribute to the long-term architectural vibrancy of the community for the
purpose of encouraging economic development activities that enlarge the tax base and by providing
desirable residences and places of shopping, employment and public assembly.
This code encourages the placement of buildings closer to each other as well as closer to the street
where pedestrian activity is expected to occur. As the sidewalks remain the principal place of
pedestrian movement and casual social interaction, designs and uses should be complementary of that
function. The desired result is a reduction in traffic congestion and an overall improvement in the quality
of life.

515.3.0 DISTRICT PROVISIONS
This ordinance has been prepared as a new District within the context of the existing zoning ordinance with three
sub-districts or zones further defining the area. These districts have been established using the Transect as the
fundamental organizing tool. The Transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environment as a
continuum of six conditions, ranging from rural to urban. The value of the Transect is that it serves to locate any
given place within a context in which all of the parts fit together harmoniously. The diagram below illustrates
these conditions as they would apply to the entire City with environmentally areas that are permanently
preserved for natural areas and the downtown that is supported first and foremost for human habitat.1
For example, a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like farmhouses or barns.
An urban street, depending on the intensity of urbanism, may have curbs and gutters, regularly placed street
trees, sidewalks, and building forms that include common walls, flat roofs, and cornices. Each Transect zoning
category has detailed provisions for each neighborhood, for density, height, street design, public space design,
mix of uses, building design, parking, and other aspects of the human environment. For the purposes of this
ordinance, only the most urban zones, the T4, the T5 and T6 were incorporated for use. They are noted on the
regulating plan and zoning map as being sub-districts of the Downtown (D) District. These zones can be best
characterized as follows:
D-T4: The urban neighborhoods that surround or are integral to the downtown area.
D-T5: The gateway corridors and blocks surrounding the downtown core.
D-T6: The core of the downtown area with the highest level of pedestrian activity and urbanism.
1 At this time, the above illustration is only applied to the Downtown District as shown on the Downtown Regulating Plan.

3.1 Interpretation of Use Matrices
3.1.1 Any use not listed in the Use Matrix is prohibited unless the Planning Director determines that it falls
within the same class as a listed use as set forth below. Should the Planning Director determine that a
materially similar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not
listed and the Planning Directors decision shall be recorded in writing. Should the Planning Director
determine that a materially similar use does not exist, this Chapter may be amended to establish a
specific listing for the use in question.
3.1.2 The Planning Director may determine that a use is materially similar if:
a. The use is listed as within the same Structure or Function classification as the use specifically
enumerated in the Use Matrix, as determined by the Land-Based Classification Standards
(LBCS) of the American Planning Association [Reference:
http://www.planning.org/lbcs/index.html]. The use shall be considered materially similar if it falls
within the same LBCS classification and meets the requirements of subsection b below.
b. The proposed use shall not generate average daily trips exceeding other similar uses proposed in
the zoning district by more than ten percent (10%), as determined by the Institute of Transportation
Engineers, Trip Generation (7th ed., 2003, or as amended)(the ITE Manual), which document is
hereby incorporated by this reference. If the trip generation is not listed in the ITE Manual, then the
use shall be considered materially similar to the use that most closely approximates the proposed
use. The Planning Director may also refer to similar local traffic studies.
3.1.3 In order to assist in interpretation of the Use Matrix, the LBCS numbers where applicable are
enumerated. In interpreting the Use Matrix, the following rules of construction shall apply:
a. If a use is listed for a specific classification, while a more general classification within the same
industry classification is also listed for another use, the specific classification governs. The specific
use is not permitted in all districts where the uses coded to the general classification are permitted
simply because they share a similar LBCS code number. The numbers increase as the
classifications get more specific.
b. Some uses are listed separately, but fall within the same LBCS classification. The uses within one
such classification are not permitted in all of the Downtown districts as the others simply because
they fall within the same LBCS classification.

3.6 BUILDING HEIGHT
3.6.1 Story:
A story is a habitable level within a building of no more
than 14 feet in height from finished floor to finished ceiling.
Unoccupied attics less than 7 feet in height and raised
basements less than 6 feet in height (as measured from
the average grade of the fronting sidewalk) are not
considered stories for the purposes of determining building
height. A mezzanine shall be considered a story if it is
contiguous with at least 60% of the buildings front façade,
is designed to be occupiable, and maintains an average
depth of at least 16 feet. A penthouse shall be considered
a story if it exceeds one-third of the area of the roof. The
under-roof area with dormers does not count as a story.
3.6.2 Items Not Included in Calculation: The height limitations
of this Ordinance shall not apply to church spires, belfries,
cupolas, and domes not intended for human occupancy,
monuments, water towers, observation towers,
transmission towers, chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors,
flagpoles, masts and antennas; provided evidence from appropriate authorities is submitted to the effect
that such building or structure will not interfere with any airport zones or flight patterns.
3.7 DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES AND HEIGHT BONUSES: A bonus system has been established as a
means to encourage certain site or building improvements that add to the aesthetic character or
environmental sustainability of the downtown area. Compliance with certain additional standards
provides the developer with additional buildable stories for individual buildings subject to review and
approval by the Design Review Board. The Design Review Board shall use the incentives noted below
as guidelines in their review but shall also have the discretion to ensure that the overall scale, massing,
and frontage of the structure is compatible with other structures within adjacent blocks.
3.7.1 Green Building Height Bonus Option
a. Using the U.S. Green Building Councils Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDTM)
Green Building Rating System, the City has established an incentive program to encourage
construction of more environmentally-friendly buildings consistent with the goals of the Downtown
Plan. All new development or rehabilitation projects in the Downtown District are eligible for bonus
height consideration.
b. Additional Height: In order to be considered by the DRB to fully qualify for the height bonus, the
development must guarantee a LEED rating at the Silver level or above (Gold or Platinum). For site
plan proposals in which the LEED-certified Platinum award levels are being sought the DRB may
consider granting additional height. Additional incentives for projects pursuing the Platinum level
may also be considered by the City. The guidelines for height bonuses subject to the discretion of
the DRB are as follows:
LEED Rating D-T4 D-T5 D-T6
Silver n/a 2 Stories 3 Stories

Maximum*
c. Implementation: The Green Building Incentive Program will be implemented as follows:
1. At the time of site plan submission, the developer will be required to submit the LEED
scorecard (LEED Version 2.2 or the most recent update) along with the site plan application.
The LEED Scorecard will be accompanied by an explanation of how and/or why each credit
can or cannot be achieved. The LEED scorecard is a checklist of green building standards and
allows the developer to voluntarily score the building against the LEED Green Building Rating
System. The scorecard is the documentation supporting the developers request for bonus
height. The scorecard is used to select which credits the developer intends to pursue and the
number of points earned determines the award level.
2. The building registration and other required information will be filed with USGBC at the
beginning of the project for LEED certification and rating by the developer.
3. The proposed site plan (including the requested bonus height) will undergo the typical review
process. The City and the developer will enter into a development agreement requiring that the
green building components identified in the scorecard be constructed or installed in the
building and that any third-party inspection fees will be paid for by the developer.
4. Once the site plan is approved, permit drawings will be reviewed to ensure inclusion of the
approved green building components, which were previously identified in the scorecard. The
City will utilize third-party LEED-certified inspectors or architects hired by the developer during
review of the permit drawings and construction of the building. Permits will not be issued
unless approved LEED components are included in the plan drawings.
5. At the time of permit application, the owner must post a performance bond in a form
acceptable to the City of Spartanburg. The amount of the required performance bond must be
calculated as follows:
a. Two percent (2%) of the total cost of construction for a 50,000  100,000 square foot
building.
b. Three percent (3%) of the total cost of construction for a 100,001  200,000 square
foot building.
c. Four percent (4%) of the total cost of construction for any building greater than
200,000 square feet.
6. The application for LEED certification and rating will be submitted to USGBC when the building
construction is complete or substantially complete, depending on the credits elected. If during
construction of the building, the developer is unable to include all of the approved green
building components previously identified in the scorecard, the developer will be required to
replace components not provided with other green building components acceptable to USGBC
and the LEED Rating System.

* Revision Date 11-12-2010
** Amended  Added Section 515, Downtown Code, to City Zoning Ordinance 9/24/12
7. During plan review and construction, the LEED-certified inspector or architect will provide
documentation and submit regular reports to the City ensuring compliance (or at least flag
problems early on) with the LEED standards and scorecard and the approved site plan. If
during construction, the developer is unable to include required green building components, or
if the inspector/architect finds that the developer failed to include these components, then the
City will pursue enforcement.
8. The Certificate of Occupancy will be issued when the building is LEED certified (at the agreed
upon level or better) by USGBC and construction is consistent with the approved site plan.
Certification by USGBC will be obtained when the building is complete and the developer has
constructed or installed the approved green building components previously identified. The
performance bond must be forfeited to the City in the event that the building does not meet the
verification requirements for LEED. The City will draw down on the bond funds if LEED
certification has not been achieved and accepted by the City within one year of the City
issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy for the building.
9. Funds that become available to the City from the forfeiture of the performance bond must be
placed in a capital fund designated by the city to be used only for certain public benefits within
the Downtown area as follows: workforce/affordable housing, public parks/civic space, an/or
street/streetscape improvements.
3.7.2 Mixed-Use Building Height Bonus Option: To encourage housing options in the downtown area,
mixed-use buildings (those with ground floor uses that differ from the floors above) may exceed the
permitted height with additional levels that provide housing subject to the review and approval of the
DRB. The DRB shall have sole discretion to determine the extent of this bonus however no structure in
the D-T4 shall be permitted to exceed 4 stories.
515.4.0 GENERAL STANDARDS
4.1 CIVIC/LANDMARK BUILDINGS: The Civic/Landmark building type includes prominent public buildings
such as libraries and city halls; semi-public buildings such as museums and colleges; and private
buildings such as hospitals and churches. This definition also includes buildings in prominent locations
 specifically those at primary pedestrian-oriented street intersections and at the terminations of
pedestrian-oriented-streets. Because of the unique characteristics of the Civic/Landmark Building, it
shall be subject to Design Review in accordance with Section 2.4. As part of this review process, the
applicant may request modifications from the applicable district standards. However, all such
modifications shall otherwise conform to the general principles for Civic/Landmark buildings below:
? If indicated on the Downtown Master Plan, they must comply with the recommendations
therein.
? They should be sited to terminate a street vista whenever possible and must incorporate
appropriate prominent features, designs, and entrances to celebrate a visual termination.
? They should incorporate detailing and materials that are authentic to the intended style.
? A pedestrian plaza, courtyard, or similar landscaped area may be substituted for a required
building frontage and minimum setback line.
? Building entrances for civic buildings only may be raised above the street elevation and
accessed via a monumental stair.

? They should respect the character of the fronting streets through the provision of a pedestrianfriendly
orientation including clear entrances from the street and permeable street walls with
adequate windows (no blank walls).
4.2 REQUIRED SHOPFRONT DESIGNATION: If a site is designated on the Downtown Regulating Plan as
located on a block face with Required Shopfronts, then all new development on that site must provide
one of the following Private Frontages at sidewalk level along the entire length of the frontage in
accordance with Table 3  Shopfront & Awning, Gallery, or Arcade. While retail/restaurant uses are not
required, the intent of this requirement is to provide a building type that would not preclude those uses
at some point in the future through the depth of the first and second layer.
4.3 KENNEDY STREET OVERLAY: For D-T5 lots with frontage along Kennedy Street as noted on the
Downtown Regulating Plan, the following standards shall be as follows:
a. Frontage Build-Out Exemption: There shall be no required frontage build-out
b. Parking Location: Parking may be permitted in the side yard (2nd and 3rd Layer) however no parking
may not be located at a corner.
4.4 MAIN STREET HEIGHT OVERLAY: For D-T6 lots with frontage along certain blocks of Main Street as
noted on the Downtown Regulating Plan, no portion of a structure within 60 feet of Main Street shall
exceed 4 stories.
515.5.0 LOT/SITE STANDARDS
5.1 General Lot Standards
5.1.1 Lot Frontage: All lots must front a street, square or common open space. (Exception: Buildings which
are interior to a site that has buildings that otherwise meet the frontage requirement). Facades must be
built parallel to the principal frontage line or parallel to the tangent of a curved principal frontage line.
5.1.2 Corner Lots: Buildings located at street intersections must place the main building, or part of the
building, at the corner.
5.1.3 Pedestrian Entries from Frontage Line: Buildings must have their principal pedestrian entrances on a
frontage line.
5.1.4 Setbacks: Front and side setbacks must be consistent with those of surrounding buildings. Buildings
on infill lots should generally setback a distance equal to an average of buildings on either side of the
proposed development on the same side of the street. Setbacks may be otherwise adjusted by
Discretionary Review. A building may be set back to create an outdoor room where the building
serves as a termination of a pedestrian street.
5.1.5 Adjacent Lots: For similarly used
properties, the grade of adjacent lots
should match where the properties
meet. If there is a significant grade
difference, development should create
an attractive transition using creative
grading and landscaping or a
decorative retaining wall, incorporating
Transitions to adjacent lots should, at a minimum, provide for pedestrian access
if existing grades are not favorable for full at-grade access. (Ref. 5.1.4)

rock covered slope.
5.1.6 Loading Docks: Loading docks and service areas shall be permitted on frontages only by
Discretionary Review.
5.2 Utilities and Trash Containment
5.2.1 Underground Utilities: Underground utilities (and associate pedestals, cabinets, junction boxes and
transformers) must be located in alleys, where possible. To reduce the visual impact of overhead
wiring, utility services must be located underground.
5.2.2 Solid Waste Storage Areas: All trash containment devices, including compactors and dumpsters,
must be located and designed so as not to be visible from the view of nearby streets and properties.
Screening, where required, must meet the requirements of Section 505.63. If the device is not visible
from a public right-of-way or park, then it need not be screened.
5.2.3 Mechanical and Utility Equipment: Mechanical and utility equipment must be screened from view
from nearby streets and properties in the same manner as trash containment areas. Ground mounted
equipment must be located in the rear or side yard and screened. Roof mounted equipment shall not
be visible from nearby streets. Setbacks from the edge of the roof or a screen higher than the
equipment may be used. Screens must be made of materials which are compatible with the exterior of
the building. If the equipment is not visible off-site, then it need not be screened. The type of screening
used must be determined based on the proposed location of the equipment, existing site conditions,
and the type and amount of existing and proposed vegetation on the site.

515.6 BUILDING STANDARDS
6.1 General Building Design Standards
6.1.1 Architectural Style: The building design standards of this Chapter intentionally do not mandate a
particular style and permit a wide variety of architectural expressions. However, when a design exhibits
a known architectural style (i.e. Colonial, Victorian, Classical Revival) the details must be consistent
with that style unless the local architectural vernacular of the upstate South Carolina area provides an
alternate precedent for a detail or element.
6.1.2 Compatibility: Adjacent buildings should relate in similarity of scale, bulk, height, architectural style,
and/or configuration.
6.1.3 Proportions: Windows, doors, columns, eaves, parapets, and other building components must be
proportional to the overall scale of the building. Wherever possible,
windows must be vertically proportioned
6.1.4 Wall Materials: When two or more materials are used on a façade,
the heavier material (i.e. brick) should be placed below the lighter
material (i.e. siding) to give the sense of support and grounding.
6.1.5 Façade Treatment: Architectural elements like windows and
doors, bulkheads, masonry piers, transoms, cornice lines, window
hoods, awnings, canopies, and other similar details must be used
on all facades facing public rights-of-way.
6.1.6 Building Wall Offsets: Building wall offsets, including projections,
recesses, and changes in floor level must be used in order to: add
architectural interest and variety; relieve the visual effect of a
single, long wall; and subdivide the wall into human size
proportions. Similarly, roofline offsets should be provided to lend
architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to
relieve the effect of a single, long roof.
6.1.7 Building Entrances: A functioning entrance, operable during normal business hours for ingress and
egress, is required facing the primary street. Buildings located on street corners may have a corner
entrance.
6.2 Specific Building Design Standards (All D-T4 and Residential Structures/Frontages in DT-5 &
DT-6)
6.2.1 Roof and Eaves
a. Buildings must have sloped roofs. Main roofs on residential buildings must have a pitch between
8:12 and 12:12. Monopitch (shed) roofs are allowed only if they are attached to the wall of the
main building. No monopitch roof shall have a pitch less than 4:12. Flat Roofs will be permitted
subject to design review by the Design Review Board. (D-T4)
b. Flat roofs are permitted. (D-T5 & D-T6)
c. . Flush eaves must be finished by profiled molding or gutters.
d.. All rooftop equipment must be screened from view.

transparent windows (excluding glass block) or doorways (egress only doorway excluded).
6.2.3 Building Entrances
a. Raised Entries: To provide privacy, all residential entrances within 15 feet of the sidewalk must be
raised from the finished grade (at the building line) a minimum of 2 feet.
b. Porches: Useable porches and stoops are recommended to form a predominate motif of the
building design and be located on the front and/or side of the building to respond to the climatic
conditions and the vernacular of the upstate. Useable front porches are at least 8 feet deep and 12
feet in width. (D-T4)
c. Crawlspace: The crawlspace of buildings, if provided, must be enclosed.
6.2.4 Garages
a. Garages with front loading bays must be recessed from the front facade of the house by a
minimum of five (5) feet; must be visually designed to form a secondary building volume; and must

515.11 DEFINITIONS
11.1 GENERAL DEFINITIONS
This Section provides definitions for terms in this Code that are technical in nature or that otherwise may not reflect a
common usage of the term. If a term is not defined in this Article, then the Planning Department shall determine the correct
definition of the term.
Building Configuration: the form of a building, based
on its massing, private frontage, and height.
Building Disposition: the placement of a building on its
lot.
Building Type: a structure category determined by
function, disposition on the lot, and configuration,
including frontage and height.
Civic: the term defining not-for-profit organizations
dedicated to arts, culture, education, recreation,
government, transit, and municipal parking.
Civic Building: a building designed specifically for a
civic function.
Civic Space: an outdoor area dedicated for public use.
Civic Space types are defined by the combination of
certain physical constants including the relationship
between their intended use, their size, their landscaping
and their enfronting buildings.
Commercial: the term collectively defining workplace,
office and retail functions.
Curb: the edge of the vehicular pavement detailed as a
raised curb or flush to a swale. The Curb usually
incorporates the drainage system.
Elevation: an exterior wall of a building not along a
Frontage Line. See: Facade
Enfront: the placement of an element along a frontage
line such as a public street right-of-way or park.
Entrance, Principal: the main point of access of
pedestrians into a building.
Facade: the exterior wall of a building that is set along a
Frontage Line (see Elevation; Frontage Line).
Frontage Line: those lot lines that coincide with a public
right-of-way. Facades along Frontage Lines define the
public realm and are therefore more regulated than the
elevations that coincide with other Lot Lines.
Infill: a project within existing urban fabric.
Layer: a range of depth of a lot within which certain
elements are permitted.
Liner Building: a building specifically designed to mask
a parking lot or a parking garage from a frontage.

demarcates a lot (see Frontage Line). Codes reference
lot lines as the baseline for measuring setbacks.
Lot Width: the length of the principal Frontage Line of a
lot.
Parking Structure: a building containing two or more
stories of parking.
Principal Building: the main building on a lot, usually
located toward the frontage.
Private Frontage: the privately held layer between the
frontage line and the principal building facade. The
structures and landscaping within the Private Frontage
may be held to specific standards. The variables of
Private Frontage are the depth of the setback and the
combination of architectural elements such as fences,
stoops, porches and galleries.
Public Frontage: the area between the curb of the
vehicular lanes and the Frontage Line. Elements of the
Public Frontage include the type of curb, walk, planter,
street tree and streetlight.
Rear Alley (AL): a vehicular driveway located to the rear
of lots providing access to service areas and parking,
and containing utility easements. Alleys should be paved
from building face to building face, with drainage by

variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary
hardship if the board makes and explains in writing the
following findings:
(a) There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions
pertaining to the particular piece of property;
(b) These conditions do not generally apply to other
property in the vicinity;

355
(c) Because of these conditions, the application of the
ordinance to the particular piece of property would
effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the
utilization of the property; and
(d) The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and
the character of the district will not be harmed by the
granting of the variance.
(e) In granting a variance, the board may attach to it such
conditions regarding the location, character, or other
features of the proposed building, structure, or use as the
board may consider advisable to protect established
property values in the surrounding area or to promote the
public health, safety, or general welfare;
(3) To permit uses by special exception subject to the terms and
conditions for the uses set forth for such uses in the zoning
ordinance; and
(4) To remand a matter to an administrative official, upon motion
by a party or the boards own motion, if the board determines
the record is insufficient for review. A partys motion for
remand may be denied if the board determines that the record is
sufficient for review. The board must set a rehearing on the
remanded matter without further public notice for a time certain
within sixty days unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The
board must maintain a list of persons who express an interest in
being informed when the remanded matter is set for rehearing,
and notice of the rehearing must be mailed to these persons
prior to the rehearing.
(B.) Appeals to the board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by
any officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality or
county. The appeal must be taken within a reasonable time, as
provided by the zoning ordinance or rules of the board, or both,
by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with
the board of appeals notice of appeal specifying the grounds for
the appeal. If no time limit is provided, the appeal must be taken
within thirty days from the date the appealing party has received
actual notice of the action from which the appeal is taken. The
officer from whom the appeal is taken immediately must transmit
to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
(C.) An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken
certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal has been filed
with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay
would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.
In that case, proceedings may not be stayed other than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court

Zoning Appeals only in accordance with the standards established above, and may
be granted only in the following instances and in no others:
1. To permit any yard less than the requirements of this Ordinance;
2. To permit the reduction of any required setback being in compliance with all
applicable Building and Fire Codes and subject to review by the Building
Official; (*)
3. To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited solely because
of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but in no event shall the
respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than eighty percent (80%) of
the required area and width;
4. To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required facilities
for two or more units, provided that substantial use of such facility by each use
does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same days of the
week;

5. To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by not
more than one (1) parking space or loading space, or twenty-five percent

9. To reduce the setback requirement for portable signs provided that no variance
shall be granted to permit such signs within the triangular area formed by the
right-of-way lines of intersecting streets (or a street and a driveway), and a line
joining points on the right-of-way lines twenty-five (25) feet from the point of
their intersection. If the property in question has no defined driveway to its
parking area the Board shall satisfy itself that the proposed location of the
portable sign will not interfere with traffic by blocking reasonable sight lines
for streets, sidewalks and driveways before any variance is granted. The
application for such variance shall be accompanied by a scaled drawing
showing all information relevant to the variance request. (**)
603.5 Special Exceptions.
Where provided for in this Section the Board of Zoning Appeals may, in
appropriate cases, grant special exceptions after public notice and public hearing.
In exercising the above powers, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, in conformity
with the provisions of this Section, reverse or affirm (wholly or in part), or may
modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall
have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or
direct the issuance of a permit. In the execution of its duties, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may subpoena witnesses and in case of contempt may certify such fact to
the circuit court having jurisdiction.
603.51 Purpose.
The development and execution of a comprehensive zoning ordinance are
based upon the division of the city into districts, within which the use of
land and structures and the bulk and location of structures in relation to the
land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
certain uses and features, which because of their unique characteristics,
cannot be distinctly classified or regulated in a particular district or
districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of such uses
and features upon neighboring uses and the surrounding area, compared
with the public need for them at particular locations. Such uses and
features are therefore treated as special exceptions.

Please note that any reference to the previous zone of B-2/Central Business District was amended by Council 9/24/12 and changed to DT4,
D-T5, and D-T6/Downtown Urban District. Please refer to Section 515 to review the Urban Code.
358
A special exception is not the automatic right of any applicant.
603.52 Authority. (*)
A special exception may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, in
appropriate cases, after public notice property posting and hearing. Only
those uses listed under use regulations for residential districts as uses
permitted by special exception and those uses where the letters SE appear
in the column in the Table of Permitted Uses for Nonresidential Districts
are eligible for a special exception. (See Section 301 of this Ordinance.)
603.53 Guidelines.
The Board shall consider the following factors in determining whether a
special exception should be granted, in addition to specific criteria in
district regulations:
(1) Traffic impact;
(2) Vehicle and pedestrian safety;
(3) Potential impact of noise, lights, fumes, or obstruction of air flow on
adjoining property;
(4) Adverse impact of proposed use on the surrounding area including
the aesthetic character of the area; and
(5) Orientation and spacing of improvements or structures.
(6) Compliance with the Comprehensive Plan.
The Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to relieve
or reduce adverse impact of a special exception and to protect the
character of the area. No variance may be granted by the Board in
connection with the granting of a special exception.
603.54 Extensions or Alterations.
Where an existing use which is permitted only by special exception is
proposed to be extended or substantially altered in a manner which would
in any way change the character or intensity of the use, such proposed
extension or substantial alteration shall be treated as a special exception
under this Section.
603.55 Failure to Comply with Conditions.
Failure to comply with conditions set by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a
basis for granting a special exception shall constitute a violation of this
Ordinance.
603.56 Not Transferable.
A Special Exception is not transferable and shall be null and void if, prior
to construction of a project, there is a change of ownership of the land for
which said permit has been issued and/or in the nature of the special use,
provided that a seller of the property may seek a Special Exception when
there is an interested purchaser for the property and this is disclosed. This

359
Special Exception, if granted, is transferable only to the interested
purchaser that was disclosed at the time of the hearing. (**) (****)
603.57 Filing of Applications and Public Hearings. (*)
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time and manner for
holding public hearings on applications for special exceptions and may
prescribe such rules and forms as it deems necessary for the filing of
applications and plans, postponement, time for exercise, extension of time,
rehearings, and other matters. The Board of Zoning Appeals will not
consider any question or request for special exception or take any action
on any matter that has been considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals
within one (1) year from the date of the petition or request for the special
exceptions.

mediator must provide the parties with a signed copy of the
written mediation agreement.
(D.) Before the terms of a mediation settlement may take effect,
the mediation settlement must be approved by:

(2) the circuit court as provided in subsection (G).
(E.) Any land use or other change agreed to in mediation which
affects existing law is effective only as to the real property
which is the subject of the mediation, and a settlement
agreement sets no precedent as to other parcels of real
property.
(F.) If mediation is not successful or if the mediated settlement is
not approved by the local legislative governing body, a
property owner may appeal by filing a petition in writing
setting forth plainly, fully, and distinctly why the decision is
contrary to law. The petition must be filed with the circuit

Circuit Court Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules; or
(2) The failure to approve the settlement by the local

settlement has a rational basis in accordance with the
standards of this chapter. If the mediated settlement is not
approved by the court, the judge must schedule a hearing for
the parties to present evidence and must issue a written
opinion containing findings of law and fact. A party may
appeal from the decision:

? 606 LEGAL STATUS PROVISIONS
606.1 Re-enactment and Repeal of Existing Zoning Ordinance.
This Ordinance is in part carried forward by re-enactment some of the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Spartanburg (Ordinance No. Z-24, adopted on May 25,
1959, as amended, and includes revised Barbour-Cooper Report, Barbour-Cooper and
Associates, Inc., Asheville, North Carolina, Consultants, October 1968) and it is not the
intention to repeal, but rather to re-enact and continue in force such existing provisions so
that all rights and liabilities that have accrued hereunder are preserved and may be
enforced. All provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Spartanburg enacted on
May 25, 1959, as amended, which are not re-enacted herein are hereby repealed. All suits
at law or in equity and/or all prosecutions resulting from the violation of any zoning
ordinance heretofore in effect, which are now pending in any of the courts of this State or

Ordinance but shall be prosecuted to their finality the same as if this Ordinance had not
been adopted; any and all violations of existing zoning ordinances, prosecutions for which
have not been instituted, may be hereafter filed and prosecuted; and nothing in this
Ordinance shall be so construed as to abandon, abate, or dismiss any litigation or
prosecution now pending, and/or which may hereto have been instituted or prosecuted.

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance is, for any reason,
held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
this Ordinance. The City Council of the City of Spartanburg hereby declares that it would
have passed this Ordinance and each section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase
thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences,
clauses or phrases be declared invalid.
606.3 Effect upon Outstanding Building Permits.
Nothing herein contained shall required any change in the plans, construction, size or
designated use of any building structure or part thereof for which a building permit had
been granted by the Building Inspector before the time of passage of this Ordinance;
provided, however, that where construction is not begun under such outstanding permit
within a period of sixty (60) days subsequent to passage of this Ordinance or where it has
not been prosecuted to completion within eighteen (18) months subsequent to passage of
this Ordinance, any further construction or use shall be in conformance with the provisions
of this Ordinance.
606.4 Conflict with Other Regulation.
Where the conditions imposed by any provisions of this Ordinance, upon the use of land or
buildings or upon the bulk of buildings, are either more restrictive or less restrictive than
comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of this Ordinance or of any other
law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more
restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.

To Be Inserted as Section 515 in the Zoning Ordinance
USERS GUIDE
The Spartanburg Downtown Code serves to condense and replace the existing medley of districts in the Zoning Ordinance and on the Zoning Map. To that end, the downtown area should be zoned in a manner that is both consistent with the Downtown Plan, but permits some flexibility in varying the ideas set forth in it.
Users of this document will notice that this Downtown Code has been ordered in a manner that addresses the standards for the most public realm, the street, to the most private realm, the building. As a design becomes more detailed and moves from the subdivision plan to the site plan to the building elevation, users are encouraged to progress through the document.
The guiding principle of this Downtown Code is that the use of the property, while important, is subordinate to the design of the building within which it is contained. This encourages visual compatibility while permitting mixed uses in close proximity to each another.
515.1 PURPOSE & INTENT
The purpose of this code is to implement the vision and goals of the Downtown Master Plan. These regulations are designed to permit the development and redevelopment of the central business district and its immediate surroundings. The intent is to accommodate mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly buildings and public spaces in the downtown that over time will evolve into areas allowing people to live, work, shop, gather, worship, and other public events.
This code attaches the same or greater level of importance to the overall building design as is placed on the uses within the building to create a convenient and attractive community. Buildings added to Downtown should contribute to the long-term architectural vibrancy of the community to encourage economic development activities that enlarge the tax base and by providing desirable residences and places of shopping, employment and public assembly.
This code encourages the placement of buildings closer to each other as well as closer to the street where pedestrian activity is expected to occur. As the sidewalks remain the principal place of pedestrian movement and casual social interaction, designs and uses should be complementary of that function. The desired result is a reduction in traffic congestion and an overall improvement in the quality of life.
There are five core principle which guide these standards and serve as the essential guidelines for the review of all applications:
A: CONNECTIVITY
Downtown Spartanburg has a generally well-defined street grid pattern; however, not every street accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. In truth, only Main Street provides a clearly defined pedestrian realm; all other streets are heavily weighted towards the automobile. The Downtown Plan suggests that each street should provide greater balance between pedestrian and vehicular modes of travel. In fact, the desired balance should favor the needs of the pedestrian in an effort to create an environment that encourages walking in the downtown.
There are two fundamental elements for a satisfactory pedestrian environment  the destination and the journey. While there are many destinations throughout the downtown, they are not always clustered nor
DOWNTOWN CODE
Spartanburg, SC
3
are they always convenient depending on the origin of the trip. The best way to manage and encourage the journey between destinations is to improve streetscapes and create more interesting storefronts and building facades.
The Plan proposes improved streetscapes with wider sidewalks and landscaping along the primary pedestrian corridors (Church Street, Converse Street, Liberty Street, East Main Street, Broad Street, Kennedy Street). It also incorporates new bicycle routes connecting the regional trail network with various recreation destinations and the colleges. It encourages ground level service/retail/restaurants along certain streets to provide an interesting trip that draws the pedestrian from one place to the next. Finally, the Plan recommends a conversion of Broad Street from a wide 5 lane street to a street with on-street parking similar to Dunbar Street. With these improvements, downtown Spartanburg will achieve an urban atmosphere that is comfortable and welcoming.
B: HOUSING
A great downtown is made up of great, diverse neighborhoods. More housing equals more people. More people equals more potential customers and clients for retail and restaurants. The daytime population of office workers, while significant, is not sufficient to support these shops and services long term; they depend on a 12-18 hour environment for success. There are three principal components to ensure a successful housing market.
Bring Back the Middle Class: Based on the demographic analysis, there is a disproportionately small middle-class within the city limits. The middle-class represents the stable socio-economic base from which retail sales are generated, high-qualified employees are found, and new businesses are formed. The success of regenerating neighborhoods like Hampton Heights with new and renovated housing should be supported and expanded.
High Quality, Affordable Housing: Fragile or threatened neighborhoods, such as the Spartan Mills neighborhood, must be restabilized. New neighborhoods should be mixed-income and the architecture and site planning held to the same high standards as every other neighborhood. The most successful affordable units should be virtually indistinguishable from market rate units.
Urban Housing: New urban-scaled housing immediately adjacent to downtown as well as in the upper floors of new buildings should be actively pursued. Housing that is urban recognizes that density and design can promote a vibrant pedestrian environment. New building types such as narrow lot detached homes, brownstones, flats, condominiums, and live-work units should be introduced around Main Street.
C: MIXED-USE INFILL & REDEVELOPMENT
Great downtowns are built in fine-grained increments. The mega-project rarely saves a downtown and is very difficult - financially and politically - to achieve. In truth, the largest scale projects that might be achievable for a City like Spartanburg have already occurred  the Dennys Tower, the Marriott Hotel, and the Chapman Cultural Center. The focus now must be on filling in the numerous small-scale gaps with highly-detailed mixed-use buildings that enliven the sidewalks with ground level activity such as shops and restaurants and provide opportunities for employment and housing on the upper floors.
D: DOWNTOWN SHOULD BE URBAN
What makes downtowns different than the shopping mall? In short, it is the urbanism of the downtown - the variety of opportunities for social interaction - that make downtowns desirable locations. This
DOWNTOWN CODE
Spartanburg, SC
4
philosophy is as old as Spartanburg itself. From Sales Day in 1888 to Jazz on the Square in 2007 Spartanburg was built on a premise of providing public spaces that every citizen can use.
As an urban environment, the downtown should be pedestrian-friendly and mixed-use. New buildings should be judged not only by their tax value but also by whether they provide street-level activity. Buildings should be built to the sidewalk and have entries accessible to the public with lots of windows and detailing. Storefront bays should be constructed in increments as small as possible - Main Street was built with facades that are less than 50 feet in width.
Downtown should have an urban, not a suburban feel. Surface parking should be avoided in favor of parking structures. On-street parking should be provided on every street possible. Street trees and landscaping should accent the storefronts, not obscure them. Lighting at night should come from display windows first, then pedestrian scaled fixtures, and finally by street lights if necessary.
Finally, downtown should be recognized as a neighborhood - but unlike suburbia, it will be a little messy. Messy does not mean unsafe or dirty; rather it indicates that many different types of people walk on the streets, garbage will be collected early in the morning, and the occasional event will make noise. Not every residential unit will have an attached garage and most parking for a shop will be in a place other than directly in front of the store. This is what it means to be a city.
E: PUT PEOPLE FIRST
Great downtowns follow one golden rule: they put people first. Pedestrians have the upper hand in the transportation system with wide sidewalks, crosswalks, and priority with traffic signals. Pedestrians are entertained along their journey with storefronts, display windows, and active uses such as retail and restaurants on the ground floors. Additionally, they are provided benches to rest, places to relax, and plazas, squares, and parks to recreate.
The image to the right illustrates the distances and travel times that the average adult can walk to Main Street. Students from Wofford College and Converse College can walk to Morgan Square in about 15 minutes. Even the far reaches of the study area are only a twenty minute walk from the heart of downtown. The ability to make Spartanburg a walking and biking community is well within reach if circulation systems sensitive to the needs of pedestrians and bicyclists are considered. The relationship to pedestrians should be the fundamental test for every new building, every road improvement, and every street tree. This evaluation should begin where the pedestrian begins - in the neighborhoods, the college campuses, and the parking decks. Is the route safe, direct, and enjoyable?

515.3 DISTRICT PROVISIONS
This ordinance has been prepared as a new District within the context of the existing zoning ordinance with three sub-districts or zones further defining the area. These districts have been established using the Transect as the fundamental organizing tool. The Transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environment as a continuum of six conditions, ranging from rural to urban. The value of the Transect is that it serves to locate any given place within a context in which all of the parts fit together harmoniously. The diagram below illustrates these conditions as they would apply to the entire City with environmentally areas that are permanently preserved for natural areas and the downtown that is supported first and foremost for human habitat.
For example, a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like farmhouses or barns. An urban street, depending on the intensity of urbanism, may have curbs and gutters, regularly placed street trees, sidewalks, and building forms that include common walls, flat roofs, and cornices. Each Transect zoning category has detailed provisions for each neighborhood, for density, height, street design, public space design, mix of uses, building design, parking, and other aspects of the human environment. For the purposes of this ordinance, only the most urban zones, the T4, the T5 and T6 were incorporated for use. They are noted on the regulating plan and zoning map as being sub-districts of the Downtown (D) District. These zones can be best characterized as follows:
D-T3: The predominately detached residential neighborhoods that surround the downtown
D-T4: The more urban neighborhoods that are predominately residential but include some mixed-use
D-T5: The gateway corridors and blocks surrounding the downtown core
D-T6: The core of the downtown area with the highest level of pedestrian activity and urbanism

3.1 INTERPRETATION OF USE MATRICES
3.1.1 Any use not listed in the Use Matrix is prohibited unless the Planning Director determines that it falls within the same class as a listed use as set forth below. Should the Planning Director determine that a materially similar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed and the Planning Directors decision shall be recorded in writing. Should the Planning Director determine that a materially similar use does not exist, this Chapter may be amended to establish a specific listing for the use in question.
3.1.2 The Planning Director may determine that a use is materially similar if:
a. The proposed use shall not generate average daily trips exceeding other similar uses proposed in the zoning district by more than ten percent (10%), as determined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation Manual (latest edition), which document is hereby incorporated by this reference. If the trip generation is not listed in the Trip Generation Manual, then the use shall be considered materially similar to the use that most closely approximates the proposed use. The Planning Director may also refer to similar local traffic studies.
b. The Planning Director may also use one or more of the following criteria to determine material similarity:
? The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category;
? The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;
? Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
? The customer type for each activity;
? The relative number of employees in each activity;
? Hours of operation;
? Building and site arrangement;
? Vehicles used with the activity;
? The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; or
? How the use advertises itself.

3.4 BUILDING HEIGHT
3.4.1 Story:
A story is a habitable level within a building of no more than 14 feet in height from finished floor to finished ceiling. Unoccupied attics less than 7 feet in height and raised basements less than 6 feet in height (as measured from the average grade of the fronting sidewalk) are not considered stories for the purposes of determining building height. A mezzanine shall be considered a story if it is contiguous with at least 60% of the buildings front façade, is designed to be occupiable, and maintains an average depth of at least 16 feet. A penthouse shall be considered a story if it exceeds one-third of the area of the roof. The under-roof area with dormers does not count as a story.
3.4.2 Items Not Included in Calculation: The height limitations of this Ordinance shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, and domes not intended for human occupancy, monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers, chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors, flagpoles, masts and antennas; provided evidence from appropriate authorities is submitted to the effect that such building or structure will not interfere with any airport zones or flight patterns.
3.5 DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES AND HEIGHT BONUSES: A bonus system has been established as a means to encourage certain site or building improvements that add to the aesthetic character or environmental sustainability of the downtown area. Compliance with certain additional standards provides the developer with additional buildable stories for individual buildings subject to review and approval by the Design Review Board. The Design Review Board shall use the incentives noted below as guidelines in their review but shall also have the discretion to ensure that the overall scale, massing, and frontage of the structure is compatible with other structures within adjacent blocks.
3.5.1 Green Building Height Bonus Option
a. Using the U.S. Green Building Councils Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDTM) Green Building Rating System, the City has established an incentive program to encourage construction of more environmentally-friendly buildings consistent with the goals of the Downtown Plan. All new development or rehabilitation projects in the Downtown District are eligible for bonus height consideration.
b. Additional Height: To be considered by the DRB to fully qualify for the height bonus, the development must guarantee a LEED rating at the Silver level or above (Gold or Platinum). For site plan proposals in which the LEED-certified Platinum award levels are being sought the DRB may consider granting additional height. Additional incentives for projects pursuing the Platinum level may also be considered by the City. The guidelines for height bonuses subject to the discretion of the DRB are as follows:

c. Implementation: The Green Building Incentive Program will be implemented as follows:
1. At the time of site plan submission, the developer will be required to submit the latest version of the LEED scorecard along with the site plan application. The LEED Scorecard will be accompanied by an explanation of how and/or why each credit can or cannot be achieved. The LEED scorecard is a checklist of green building standards and allows the developer to voluntarily score the building against the LEED Green Building Rating System. The scorecard is the documentation supporting the developers request for bonus height. The scorecard is used to select which credits the developer intends to pursue and the number of points earned determines the award level.
2. The building registration and other required information will be filed with USGBC at the beginning of the project for LEED certification and rating by the developer.
3. The proposed site plan (including the requested bonus height) will undergo the typical review process. The City and the developer will enter into a development agreement requiring that the green building components identified in the scorecard be constructed or installed in the building and that any third-party inspection fees will be paid for by the developer.
4. Once the site plan is approved, permit drawings will be reviewed to ensure inclusion of the approved green building components, which were previously identified in the scorecard. The City will utilize third-party LEED-certified inspectors or architects hired by the developer during review of the permit drawings and construction of the building. Permits will not be issued unless approved LEED components are included in the plan drawings.
5. At the time of permit application, the owner must post a performance bond in a form acceptable to the City of Spartanburg. The amount of the required performance bond must be calculated as follows:
a. Two percent (2%) of the total cost of construction for a 50,000  100,000 square foot building.
b. Three percent (3%) of the total cost of construction for a 100,001  200,000 square foot building.
c. Four percent (4%) of the total cost of construction for any building greater than 200,000 square feet.
DOWNTOWN CODE
Spartanburg, SC
22
6. The application for LEED certification and rating will be submitted to USGBC when the building construction is complete or substantially complete, depending on the credits elected. If during construction of the building, the developer is unable to include all of the approved green building components previously identified in the scorecard, the developer will be required to replace components not provided with other green building components acceptable to USGBC and the LEED Rating System.
7. During plan review and construction, the LEED-certified inspector or architect will provide documentation and submit regular reports to the City ensuring compliance (or at least flag problems early on) with the LEED standards and scorecard and the approved site plan. If during construction, the developer is unable to include required green building components, or if the inspector/architect finds that the developer failed to include these components, then the City will pursue enforcement.
8. The Certificate of Occupancy will be issued when the building is LEED certified (at the agreed upon level or better) by USGBC and construction is consistent with the approved site plan. Certification by USGBC will be obtained when the building is complete and the developer has constructed or installed the approved green building components previously identified. The performance bond must be forfeited to the City in the event that the building does not meet the verification requirements for LEED. The City will draw down on the bond funds if LEED certification has not been achieved and accepted by the City within one year of the City issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy for the building.
9. Funds that become available to the City from the forfeiture of the performance bond must be placed in a capital fund designated by the city to be used only for certain public benefits within the Downtown area as follows: workforce/affordable housing, public parks/civic space, an/or street/streetscape improvements.
3.5.2 Mixed-Use Building Height Bonus Option: To encourage housing options in the downtown area, mixed-use buildings (those with ground floor uses that differ from the floors above) may exceed the permitted height with additional levels that provide housing subject to the review and approval of the DRB. The DRB shall have sole discretion to determine the extent of this bonus however no structure in the D-T4 shall be permitted to exceed 4 stories.
515.4 GENERAL STANDARDS
4.1 CIVIC/LANDMARK BUILDINGS: The Civic/Landmark building type includes prominent public buildings such as libraries and city halls; semi-public buildings such as museums and colleges; and private buildings such as hospitals and churches. This definition also includes buildings in prominent locations  specifically those at primary pedestrian-oriented street intersections and at the terminations of pedestrian-oriented-streets. Because of the unique characteristics of the Civic/Landmark Building, it shall be subject to Design Review in accordance with Section 2.4. As part of this review process, the applicant may request modifications from the applicable district standards. However, all such modifications shall otherwise conform to the general principles for Civic/Landmark buildings below:
? If indicated on the Downtown Master Plan, they must comply with the recommendations therein.
DOWNTOWN CODE
Spartanburg, SC
23
? They should be sited to terminate a street vista whenever possible and must incorporate appropriate prominent features, designs, and entrances to celebrate a visual termination.
? They should incorporate detailing and materials that are authentic to the intended style.
? A pedestrian plaza, courtyard, or similar landscaped area may be substituted for a required building frontage and minimum setback line.
? Building entrances for civic buildings may be raised above the street elevation and accessed via a monumental stair.
? They should respect the character of the fronting streets through the provision of a pedestrian-friendly orientation including clear entrances from the street and permeable street walls with adequate windows (no blank walls).
4.2 REQUIRED SHOPFRONT DESIGNATION: If a site is designated on the Downtown Regulating Plan as located on a block face with Required Shopfronts, then all new development on that site must provide one of the following Private Frontages at sidewalk level along the entire length of the frontage in accordance with Table 1  Shopfront & Awning, Gallery, or Arcade. While retail/restaurant uses are not required, the intent of this requirement is to provide a frontage type that would not preclude those uses at some point in the future through the depth of the first and second layer.
4.3 SIDEYARD PARKING OVERLAY: For D-T5 lots with frontage along certain streets without on-street parking as noted on the Downtown Regulating Plan, the following standards shall be as follows:
a. Frontage Build-Out Exemption: There shall be no required frontage build-out
b. Parking Location: Parking may be permitted in the side yard behind any required screening however no parking may not be located at a corner.
4.4 MAIN STREET HEIGHT OVERLAY: For D-T6 lots with frontage along certain blocks of Main Street downtown as noted on the Downtown Regulating Plan, no portion of a structure within 60 feet of Main Street shall exceed 4 stories.
515.5 LOT/SITE STANDARDS
5.1 GENERAL LOT STANDARDS
5.1.1 Lot Frontage: All lots must front a street, square or common open space. (Exception: Buildings which are interior to a site that has buildings that otherwise meet the frontage requirement). Facades must be built parallel to the principal frontage line or parallel to the tangent of a curved principal frontage line.
5.1.2 Corner Lots: Buildings located at street intersections must place the main building, or part of the building, at the corner.
5.1.3 Pedestrian Entries from Frontage Line: Buildings must have their principal pedestrian entrances on a frontage line.
5.1.4 Setbacks: Front and side setbacks must be consistent with those of surrounding buildings. Buildings on infill lots should generally setback a distance equal to an average of buildings on either side of the proposed development on the same side of the street. Setbacks may be otherwise adjusted by Discretionary Review. A building may be set back to create an outdoor room where the building serves as a termination of a pedestrian street.
DOWNTOWN CODE
Spartanburg, SC
24
5.1.5 Adjacent Lots: For similarly used properties, the grade of adjacent lots should match where the properties meet. If there is a significant grade difference, development should create an attractive transition using creative grading and landscaping or a decorative retaining wall, incorporating vehicular and pedestrian cross-access. Avoid using a blank or unscreened concrete retaining wall or rock covered slope.
5.1.6 Loading Docks: Loading docks and service areas shall be permitted on frontages only by Discretionary Review.
5.2 UTILITIES AND TRASH CONTAINMENT
5.2.1 Underground Utilities: Underground utilities (and associate pedestals, cabinets, junction boxes and transformers) must be located in alleys, where possible. To reduce the visual impact of overhead wiring, utility services must be located underground.
5.2.2 Solid Waste Storage Areas: All trash containment devices, including compactors and dumpsters, must be located and designed so as not to be visible from the view of nearby streets and properties. Screening, where required, must meet the requirements of Section 505.63. If the device is not visible from a public right-of-way or park, then it need not be screened.
5.2.3 Mechanical and Utility Equipment: Mechanical and utility equipment must be screened from view from nearby streets and properties in the same manner as trash containment areas. Ground mounted equipment must be located in the rear or side yard and screened. Roof mounted equipment shall not be visible from nearby streets. Setbacks from the edge of the roof or a screen higher than the equipment may be used. Screens must be made of materials which are compatible with the exterior of the building. If the equipment is not visible off-site, then it need not be screened. The type of screening used must be determined based on the proposed location of the equipment, existing site conditions, and the type and amount of existing and proposed vegetation on the site.
Transitions to adjacent lots should, at a minimum, provide for pedestrian access if existing grades are not favorable for full at-grade access. (Ref. 5.1.5)

515.6 BUILDING STANDARDS
6.1 GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO ALL BUILDINGS
Consistent with the key principles of the Downtown Master Plan, the Design Review Board will use the following design principles in their discretionary consideration of all applications. These guidelines are in addition to the minimum requirements found elsewhere in this code.
6.1.1 Key Principle: Connectivity
A. There are two principal components of every pedestrian trip  the journey and the destination. The journey should be continuous and safe and the destination should be interesting and attractive.
B. Streets should accommodate many users safely and comfortably with priority given to the pedestrian and the cyclist.
C. New development should not create physical or visual gaps along the street frontage and should fill in existing gaps to the greatest extent possible with interesting and active frontages.
6.1.2 Key Principle: Housing
A. Housing is strongly encouraged throughout the downtown. In general, housing should be located on upper stories.
B. Housing should not be placed on the ground floor frontage in D-T6 and along Main Street.
6.1.3 Key Principle: Mixed-Use Infill & Redevelopment
A. Great downtowns are built using fine-grained increments. Avoid large scale buildings where possible.
B. Buildings should be designed to grow and adapt over time. The accommodation of mixed-uses, whether at the time of initial occupancy or over the long-term, is strongly preferred to single-use structures.
C. To compliment the historic fabric of the downtown area, new buildings, substantial renovations, and expansions should be of the highest design quality and should be considered long-term additions to the downtown fabric.
6.1.4 Key Principle: Downtown Should Be Urban
A. Buildings should generally be simple in form, but well-detailed.
B. Facades should be designed to recognize the interior spaces of the occupants in an authentic manner. Avoid the technique of visually contriving multiple facades along a single frontage unless there is a clear break in building.
C. Avoid elaborate changes in materials, configurations, and vertical and horizontal elements that are designed to create interest from long distances or in vehicles. Because downtown buildings are most often experienced pedestrians and not from a high-speed automobile, design elements should be scaled as such.
D. Storefront bays should be constructed in increments as small as possible  preferably in widths that are 50 feet or less.
E. Surface parking in D-T5 and D-T6 is strongly discouraged in favor of structured parking.
F. Any such surface parking, if provided, should be in the rear. If permitted by the Design Review Board to be placed in the side yard, it should be considered temporary, designed to accommodate future buildings, and should not be encumbered by any legal restrictions.
6.1.5 Key Principle: Put People First
A. Buildings and sites should be designed to encourage pedestrian activity, comfort, and safety.
DOWNTOWN CODE
Spartanburg, SC
26
B. Ground floor activity is critical to pedestrian comfort and activity. Long expanses of inactivity are strongly discouraged.
C. Streetscapes should be composed of wide sidewalks for walking, seating, public art, and landscaping.
D. The presence of on-street parking provides both convenient locations to park vehicles as well as a physical barrier between moving vehicles and the pedestrian environment.
E. Visual diversity should be greatest along the street frontage. Avoid uniformity of tenant spaces along the ground floor and provide an increment of small-scale tenant spaces for frequent changes of scenery and activity.
6.2 REQUIRED BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ALL BUILDINGS
6.2.1 Architectural Style: The building design standards of this Chapter intentionally do not mandate a particular style and permit a wide variety of architectural expressions. However, when a design exhibits a known architectural style (e.g., Colonial, Victorian, Classical Revival) the details must be consistent with that style unless the local architectural vernacular of the upstate South Carolina area provides an alternate precedent for a detail or element.
6.2.2 Compatibility: Adjacent buildings should relate in similarity of scale, bulk, height, architectural style, and/or configuration.
6.2.3 Proportions: Windows, doors, columns, eaves, parapets, and other building components must be proportional to the overall scale of the building. Wherever possible, windows must be vertically proportioned.
6.2.4 Wall Materials: When two or more materials are used on a façade, the heavier material (e.g., brick) should be placed below the lighter material (e.g., siding) to give the sense of support and grounding.
6.2.5 Façade Treatment: Architectural elements like windows and doors, bulkheads, masonry piers, transoms, cornice lines, window hoods, awnings, canopies, and other similar details must be used on all facades facing public rights-of-way.
6.2.6 Building Entrances: A functioning entrance for each ground floor tenant, operable during normal business hours for ingress and egress, is required along the primary street frontage. Buildings located on street corners are encouraged to have a corner entrance.
6.3 SPECIFIC BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS (ALL D-T4 AND RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES/FRONTAGES IN D-T5 & D-T6)
6.3.1 Roof and Eaves
a. Buildings must have sloped roofs. Main roofs on residential buildings must have a pitch between 8:12 and 12:12. Monopitch (shed) roofs are allowed only if they are attached to the wall of the main
DOWNTOWN CODE
Spartanburg, SC
27
building. No monopitch roof shall have a pitch less than 4:12. Flat Roofs will be permitted subject to design review by the Design Review Board. (D-T4)
b. Flat roofs are permitted. (D-T5 & D-T6)
c. Flush eaves must be finished by profiled molding or gutters.
