examination representing 50% of the final score. In addition, each applicant

the examination and have a score which places that person in the top
35 applicants taking the test. Applicants scoring less than 70% shall be
rejected. In the event that a tie score occurs with people scoring above
70% or higher, then all applicants with that score will be considered as
passing as long as it would have put any one of the applicants with a tie
score in the top 35 scores of the applicants on the test. Within 30 days
of the administration of the written examination, all applicants shall be
given notice as to whether they have passed the written examination. Those

the oral examination, applicants whose scores are passing shall be informed
of their numerical scores on the oral examination as well as their numerical
score on the written examination. If their scores on the oral examination

A. The Commission shall request the Chief of Police or the Chief's
designee to conduct a background investigation on each applicant who

fitness test. The background investigation shall include, whenever
reasonable or practicable, interviews with the applicant's family,
acquaintances, current and former employers, current and former

designee, shall make a written recommendation to the Commission on
whether the applicant is appropriate for consideration for appointment
as a police officer.
C. Evaluation of the applicant shall be based on the criteria set forth in
§ 30-23 of these rules and regulations. This recommendation shall be in
writing, and if the recommendation is to disqualify, then a detailed
written explanation of the reasons for disqualification must be included.

information collected during the background investigation warrants
rejection of the candidate.
D. Within 30 days after the Commission considers the recommendation of
the Chief of Police or his designee, each applicant will be informed of
whether he has passed the background investigation.
E. The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee shall report the results of the
background examiner to the Commission either as a whole or in
segments of 10 at the election of the Commission. If the Commission
requests segmented background investigations, the Chief shall begin
his background investigations on the applicants with the top 10 scores
(including, where applicable, veteran's preference points). The Chief
will then proceed sequentially with the next group of 10 applicants
having the next highest scores until all successful applicants have

A. At the completion of the examination requirements set forth in Article
IV, written examination, oral examination, background investigation
and physical fitness test, the Commission shall rank all passing
applicants on a list with the applicant receiving the highest score at the
top of the list and the applicant receiving the lowest passing score at
the bottom of the list. Applicants who qualify for veterans preference
points shall have those points added to their passing score prior to
being ranked on the eligibility list. In the case of tied scores, the tie will
be broken by giving preference to the applicant who submitted a final
completed application first. If both tied applicants submitted their
completed applications on the same day, then the applicants shall be
ranked by the drawing of lots.
B. At the election of the Commission, the eligibility list may be approved in
segments of 10 based upon the receipt of the results of the background
investigation as set forth in § 30-35. If segmented, the eligibility list
shall initially consist of 10 applicants and the same shall be valid
immediately without awaiting results from the background
investigations of the lower scoring applicants. The Commission shall
add to the eligible list further names upon receipt and review of the
results of the subsequent background investigations on the remaining
successful applicants.
C. The eligibility list shall be valid for two years from the date the
Commission approves the whole list or, if segmented, from the date of
approval of the first group of applicants. The Commission may, at its
sole discretion, by a vote of the majority of the Commission at a duly
authorized Commission meeting, extend the list for an additional year.
The Commission may, at its sole discretion, void an eligibility list at any
time for any reason.
A. If a person on the eligibility list fails to respond to a notice sent to that
party's current address on file with the Commission or fails to appear
for any scheduled testing or interviews, that party's name shall be
removed from the eligibility list upon action of the Commission.
B. If a person no longer desires to remain on the eligibility list, that person
shall notify the Commission of the same and the Commission shall
remove that person's name from the list.
C. In the event of either Subsection A or B above, after the Commission
takes action to remove the person's name from the eligibility list, it shall
notify the person in writing of that person's removal from the list.
§ 30-36 CIVIL SERVICE § 30-37
30:37
§ 30-38. Appointment.
D. The name of a person appearing on the eligibility list shall be removed
by the Commission if that person is appointed to a position in the Police
Department.
E. The name of a person appearing on the eligibility list shall be removed
by the Commission if that person declines an appointment to a
permanent position in the Police Department.
F. The name of a person appearing on the eligibility list shall be removed
by the Commission if that person indicated availability for appointment
and is so appointed but fails to report for duty at the time prescribed,
unless, in the opinion of Borough Council, such person can show good
and sufficient reason for failing to report.
G. The Commission may, at its own discretion, remove from the eligibility
list the name of any person certified for appointment consideration
three times but not appointed.
A. Borough Council may fill any vacancy in an existing position in the
Police Department which occurs as a result of expansion of the police
force, retirement, resignation, disability or death by the reappointment
or reinstatement of a former employee of the Police Department who
had been furloughed. Except for physical and psychological
examinations, no other testing shall be required for a furloughed
employee or a rehired or reappointed employee.
B. If no furlough list exists or if positions remain to be filled after all of the
officers on the furlough list were offered reemployment, every position,
except that of Chief of Police, shall be filled only in the following
manner:
(1) Borough Council shall notify the Commission of any vacancy which
is to be filled and shall request the certification of three names from
the list of eligibles;
(2) If three names are not available, then the Commission shall certify
the names(s) remaining on the list;
(3) Borough Council shall make an appointment from one of the three
names certified with reference to the merits and fitness of the
candidates. However, when one of the three applicants on the
certified list is a veteran, that applicant shall be selected.
C. Borough Council may object to one or more of the persons certified for
the reasons set forth in § 30-25 of these rules and regulations. If the
candidate to whom Borough Council objects fails to timely exercise the
rights of appeal under § 30-26 or if the Commission declines to uphold
the appeal, the Commission shall strike the name of that candidate from
the eligibility list and certify the next highest name for inclusion on the
list of three candidates for each name stricken off.
§ 30-37 CATASAUQUA CODE § 30-39
30:38
§ 30-39. Physical and psychological examinations.
After Borough Council selects a candidate from the certified list of three for
appointment to the vacant position, the candidate shall submit to a physical
examination and a psychological examination by appropriate experts
appointed by the Commission. The psychological examination shall include
the administration of the MMPI or MMPI-2 by the examiner. If the candidate
successfully passes the physical and psychological examinations, then that
employee may be appointed to the vacant position in the Police Department
for which the application was submitted. The appointment shall be
contingent upon successfully passing both the physical and psychological
examinations. Failure to pass either examination shall result in the
candidate being rejected from consideration. The applicant's name will also
be removed from the eligibility list. The rejected candidate may appeal this
decision under § 30-26. The Commission shall then certify another name to
be included with the two previously certified names for consideration by
Borough Council pursuant to § 30-38.

furloughed officer. Names on the furlough list shall be arranged in priority
order based on the length of service of each furloughed officer.
§ 30-41. Removal of names from furlough lists.
A. In addition to other reasons stated as grounds for removal in these rules
and regulations, the name of a person appearing on a furlough list shall
be removed by the Commission if that person:
(1) Is appointed to a position in the Police Department; or
(2) Declines an appointment to a permanent position in the Police
Department; or
(3) Indicated availability for appointment and is so appointed but fails
to report for duty at the time prescribed, unless, in the opinion of
Borough Council, such person can show good and sufficient reason
for failing to report.
B. The Commission may, at its own discretion, remove from a furlough list
the name of any person certified for appointment consideration three
times as the top name, but not appointed.
C. Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed as authorizing the
removal of the name of a person from a furlough list who refuses to
accept a position of lower rank than that from which furloughed.

Open Records Policy
[Adopted 11-3-2008 by Ord. No. 1227]
§ 68-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to assure compliance with Act 3 of 2008, the
Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, as amended; to provide access to public
records of Catasauqua Borough; to preserve the integrity of Catasauqua
Borough's records; and to minimize the financial impact to the residents of
the Borough regarding the resources utilized in the receipt and processing
of public record requests and the retrieval and copying of public records.
§ 68-2. Designation of Open Records Officer; fees; guidelines.
A. The Borough of Catasauqua hereby designates the Borough Manager as
the Open Records Officer of the general Borough documents. As
concerns all police documents, the Borough designates the Chief of
Police of the Catasauqua Police Department as the Open Records
Officer. It is the policy of the Borough to require the presence of a
designated employee when public records are examined and inspected.
B. Further, the Borough will charge reasonable fees for the duplication of
public records of the Borough or the Police Department.
C. In accord with the Right to Know Act, the Open Records Officer will
comply with the following guidelines to the extent practical:
(1) Upon receiving a request for a public record, the Open Records
Officer shall:
(a) Note the date of receipt on the written request;
(b) Compute the day on which the five-day period will expire and
make a notation of that date on the written request; and
(c) Maintain a copy of the written request for the record until the
matter has been concluded.
(2) The Borough Manager/Chief of Police may designate certain
employee(s) to process public record requests.
(3) All requests for public records of the Borough under this policy
shall be specific in identifying and describing each public record
requested. In no case shall the Borough be required to create a
public record which does not exist or to compile, maintain, format
or organize a public record in a manner in which the Borough does
not currently compile, maintain, format or organize the public
record. All requests for public records shall be submitted in writing
on forms prepared and provided by the Borough, a copy of which is
attached to this article,16 or on the form of the commonwealth's
Office of Open Records. No other form will be accepted. All
§ 68-1 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 68-2
65:107
requests shall include the date of the request; requestor's name,
address, and telephone number; certification of United States
residency; signature of requestor; and, if duplication is requested,
appropriate payment.
(4) The Open Records Officer, or designated employee, shall make a
good faith effort to determine whether each record requested is a
public record.
(5) The Open Records Officer or designated employee shall respond to
the requestor within five business days from the date of receipt of
the written request. If the Borough does not respond within five
business days of receipt thereof, the request is deemed denied.
(6) The response provided by the Borough shall consist of:
(a) Approval for access to the public record;
(b) Review of the request by the designated employee; or
(c) Denial of access to the record requested.
(7) The response provided by the Borough shall consist of:
(a) Approval for access to the public record;
(b) Redaction of portions of the public record; or
(c) Request for additional time for the retrieval of the stored
record in a remote location;
(d) Inform the party that additional time will be necessary because
of staffing limitation;
(e) Inform the party that legal review is necessary to determine
whether the record is subject to access under the Act; or
(f) Request an extension of time from the requestor, in writing.
(8) The fees for duplication of public records shall be as established by
the commonwealth's Office of Open Records or the Borough of
Catasauqua, whichever is greater. The Borough may, at its
discretion, waive the fees.
(9) In the event the estimated cost of fulfilling a request submitted
under this policy is expected to exceed $100, the designated
employee(s) shall obtain the expected cost in advance of fulfilling
the request to avoid unwarranted expense of Borough resources.
(10) Review of request.
(a) If the request is being reviewed, the notice provided by the
Borough shall be in writing and include the reason for the
16.Editor's Note: A copy of the form is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 68-2 CATASAUQUA CODE § 68-2
65:108
review and the expected response date, which shall be within
30 days of the notice of review. If the Borough does not
respond within 30 days thereof, the request is deemed denied.
Review of the request is limited to situations where:
[1] The record requested contains information which is
subject to access, as well as information which is not
subject to access that must be redacted prior to a grant of
access. The redacted information is considered a denial as
to that information;
[2] The record requires retrieval from a remote location;
[3] A timely response cannot be accomplished due to staffing
limitations;
[4] A legal review is necessary to determine whether the
record requested is a public record;
[5] The requestor has failed to comply with the Borough's
policy and procedure requirements; or
[6] The requestor refuses to pay the applicable fees.
[7] The extent or nature of the request precludes a response
within the required time period.
(b) Upon a determination that one of the factors listed above
applies, the Borough shall send written notice to the requestor
within five business days of receipt of the request for access.
The notice shall include a statement notifying the requestor
that the request for access is being reviewed, the reason for
the review, a reasonable date that a response is expected to be
provided and an estimate of applicable fees owed when the
record becomes available. If the date that a response is
expected to be provided is in excess of 30 days, following the
five business days allowed for, the request for access shall be
deemed denied unless the requestor has agreed in writing to
an extension to the date specified in the notice. If the requestor
agrees to the extension, the request shall be deemed denied on
the day following the date specified in the notice if the agency
has not provided a response by that date.
(11) If access to the record requested is denied, the notice provided by
the Borough shall be in writing as indicated on the form attached
hereto17 entitled "Denial of Request to Review and/or Duplicate
Catasauqua Borough Records."
(12) The Borough may:

65:109
(a) Deny access to the public record under the provisions of Act 3
of 2008 including, but not limited to, failure to comply with the
Borough's policies regarding access to records, and the
requestor's refusal to pay applicable fees authorized by this
Act;
(b) Deny the record as it is one of the exceptions under Section
708 of the Public Records Act;
(c) Deny the request as the record is protected by privilege;
(d) Deny the request as the record is exempt from disclosure
under any other federal or state law, regulation or judicial
order or decree;
(e) Deny the record as it is a disruptive request;
(f) Deny the record as it may request information which could lead
to disaster or potential damage.
(13)Within 30 days of the mailing date of the final determination of the
appeals officer, the requestor or Borough may file a petition for
review or other document as required by rule of court with the
Court of Common Pleas for Lehigh County. The decision of the
court shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law based
upon the evidence as a whole. The decision shall clearly and
concisely explain the rationale for the decision. A petition for
review under this section shall stay the release of documents until a
decision is issued.
(14) This policy shall be available for review at the Borough office.

Borough, shall remove, and relocate its poles, wires, cables,
underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense.
F. The company shall not place poles or other fixtures where the same will

A. It shall be the obligation of company to serve all residents of the
Borough except to the extent that density of homes, adverse terrain or

provide for a reasonable and nondiscriminatory policy governing
extensions of cable service within the Borough, which policy was
subject to public review in the public proceeding leading to the award
of this franchise, company shall extend service to new subscribers, at
the normal installation charge and monthly rate for customers of that
classification, under the following terms and conditions:

existing cable plant.

this article to restrict the activities of other companies or to compete

article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate,

with any rule, regulation or policy, in whole or in part, of the Federal
Communications Commission or any other agency having jurisdiction,
such provision shall be invalid, but the remaining provisions hereof

Chapter 160
GARAGE SALES
§ 160-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as "the ordinance regulating and restricting
garage sales."
§ 160-2. Purpose.
Such rules and regulations as set up in this chapter are designed to control
and restrict garage sales in order to protect the public health, safety and
convenience and to restrict such sales to casual and/or occasional
occurrences only in keeping with the character of the neighborhood where
this activity is carried on and with the Zoning Ordinance of the Borough.48
The intent of this chapter is to eliminate repeated, perpetual, prolonged
and extended garage sales in residential areas. Such sales, if carried on
indefinitely or repetitively, tend to become retail businesses in residential
areas and zones, create a nuisance, and usually violate the zoning
regulations of the Borough. The provisions of this chapter arise from the
need to limit, regulate, restrict and control garage sales. It is not the intent
of this chapter to change or amend the zoning laws, transient business laws
and/or any other laws or ordinances of the Borough
§ 160-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CATASAUQUA  All residential dwellings located within any type of zone,
zoned area, zoning district, whether or not said areas or zones are
residential, business, commercial or otherwise, within the geographic
boundaries of the Borough of Catasauqua.
GARAGE SALE  The sale or offering for sale of five or more new, used
or secondhand items of personal property at any one residential premises
at any one time regardless if such sale or display is indoors or outdoors.
Includes all sales in residential areas entitled "garage sale," "yard sale,"
"tag sale," "porch sale," "lawn sale," "attic sale," "basement sale," "rummage
sale," "flea market sale" or any similar casual sale of tangible personal
property.
GOODS  Any goods, warehouse merchandise, or other personal property
capable of being the object of a sale regulated hereunder.
PERSONS  Individuals, partnerships, family groups, voluntary
associations and corporations. Charitable nonprofit institutions,
educational, cultural, or governmental institutions or organizations shall

§ 155-16 FRANCHISES § 160-3

not be defined as persons under this chapter and thus this chapter shall
have no application to the same.
§ 160-4. Permit required; failure to obtain permit.
§ 160-5. Permit application, issuance, fee and duration.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to conduct a garage sale within the
geographic boundaries of the Borough of Catasauqua without first
obtaining a garage sale license from the Borough after filing an
application containing the information hereinafter specified.

PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO AMPLIFICATION SYSTEMS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Uniform Codes  See Ch. 130.
§ 206-1. Adequate radio coverage required.
Except as otherwise provided, no person shall maintain, own, erect or
construct any building or structure, or any part thereof, or cause the same
to be done that fails to support adequate radio coverage for Borough
police officers. For purpose of this chapter, "adequate radio coverage" shall
include all of the following:
§ 206-2. Amplification system allowed.
A. A minimum signal strength of 95 dBm available in 90% of the area of
each floor of the building for two-way portable transmissions when
transmitted to the closest Lehigh County Communications System site.
B. The frequency range to be supported shall be 154.830/158.850.
A. Buildings and structures shall be equipped with any of the following in
order to achieve the required adequate radio coverage: a radiating
cable system or an internal multiple-antenna system with FCC-type
accepted bidirectional VHF amplifiers as needed to encompass Lehigh
County VHF frequencies 154.830/158.850. The system shall be capable
of operating on an independent battery and/or generator system for a
period of at least 12 hours without external power input. The battery
system shall automatically charge in the presence of external power
input. There shall be no connectivity between the amplification system
and fire alarm system. This system shall be designed to operate in
conjunction with equipment utilized by the Lehigh County

§ 206-3. Testing procedures.
Communications Center and the Borough of Catasauqua Police
Department.
B. Any bidirectional amplifier unit shall be enclosed in a cabinet with
suitable access for servicing the unit. If installed in outdoor or
unprotected locations, the cabinet shall be weatherproof stainless steel
meeting NEMA standards for weatherproof installations.
C. The unit shall be installed in a secured environment to prevent
tampering. This requirement may be met by the use of a lock on the
cabinet or by installing the unit within a secured room. Only authorized
radio communications technicians are permitted to make adjustments
to these systems.
D. Borough Police shall have access to the equipment at all times. A Knox
Box is required for any building or structure that is required to have
radio amplification equipment under this chapter.
E. Each signal amplification system shall comply and be updated to
current industry technology standards, as adhered to and implemented
by Lehigh County, as they may change from time to time.
A. Acceptance test procedure.
(1) New construction.
(a) Upon completion of construction of the structure and at such
time as the commercial structure shall become fully
operational, it will be the building owner's responsibility to
have the communication system tested to ensure that two-way
coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 90% and
shall properly interface with the total county communication
design. Said test will be conducted within 30 days of issuance
of an occupancy permit. For multitenant buildings, this test
shall be conducted within 30 days of the occupancy of 50% of
the total building area or at such time as deemed necessary by
the Borough.
(b) Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of 12
equal areas. A maximum of two nonadjacent areas will be
allowed to fail the test. In the event that three of the areas fail
the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor
may be divided into 24 equal areas. A maximum of four
nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test.
(c) After the second area test, if the building continues to fail, it
will be the building owner's responsibility to have an
amplification system installed to meet the coverage
requirement of 90%.
§ 206-2 JUNKYARDS § 206-3
170:269
(d) The test shall be conducted using a Motorola MT 2000, or
equivalent, portable radio, talking through the Lehigh County
Communications System. A spot located approximately in the
center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio
will be keyed to verify two-way communications to and from
the outside of the building through the Lehigh County
Communications System. Once the spot has been selected,
prospecting for a better spot within the grid area will not be
permitted.
(e) If the newly constructed and fully operational building fails the
test, it will be the building owner's responsibility to bring the
building or structure into compliance with this chapter at the
owner's sole expense within 90 days from the date such work is
contracted and within 180 days of the date of the
determination of noncompliance of the building or structure
with this chapter.
(f) The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test
measurement results shall be kept on file with the building
owner so that the measurements can be verified each year
during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement
results become lost, the building owner will be required to
rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.
(2) Existing structures. Upon notification from the Borough Police, the
Borough will initiate, at its expense, a radio system test to ensure
the two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of
90%. The test shall be conducted using a Motorola MT 2000, or
equivalent, portable radio, talking through the Lehigh County
Communications System. If the existing building fails the test, the
Borough will transmit the results of the test to the building owner.
It will be the building owner's responsibility to bring the building or
structure into compliance with this chapter at the owner's sole
expense within 90 days from the date such work is contracted and
within 180 days of the date of the determination of noncompliance
of the building or structure with this chapter.
B. Annual test for new construction and existing structures. When an inbuilding
radio system is required, it shall be the building owner's
responsibility to have all active components of the system, such as
amplifiers and power supplies and backup batteries, tested a minimum
of once every 12 months. The annual test results shall be supplied to the
Borough within 18 months next following the original technical
certification. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the
same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. Backup
amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was
upon initial installation and acceptance. Backup batteries and power
supplies shall be tested under load of a period of one hour to verify that
they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the
one-hour test period, and in the opinion of the testing technician, the

work. All tests shall be documented and signed by a person in possession
of a current technician certification. All test records shall be retained on
the inspected premises by the building owner and a copy submitted to the
Borough.
§ 206-5. System designs; technical certificate of compliance.
The building owner shall submit to the Borough a design for any required
amplification system to achieve the required adequate radio coverage. The
Borough shall transmit to the county the design for review by its technical
advisor or his/her designee. Should the design, as submitted comply with
the county design criteria for the building or structure, the county shall
issue a conditional approval of the design, as submitted. After installation
of the amplification system in the building or structure, the communication
interface shall be tested and, if found to be in compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, a technical certificate of compliance shall be
issued. The county or its designee and the Borough shall each signify their
respective approval and consent to the issuance of the technical certificate
of compliance. The technical certificate of compliance shall be issued by the
Borough, provided that all fees exacted therefor are paid in full.
§ 206-6. Exemptions.
This chapter shall not apply to residential buildings in the use group R-3

A. When any required police communication enhancement system is
installed and becomes inadequate or inoperative, thus affecting the
safety of a building, structure or the occupants therein, the Borough
shall order the system, unit or device to be repaired or upgraded as
necessary and returned to service within 60 days. It shall be the
responsibility of the building owner or occupant to make repairs,
alterations or additions to maintain operability of the system.

a separate offense, and the violation of each section hereof shall
constitute a separate offense.
C. Should any person refuse, neglect or fail to comply with any provision of
this chapter or with any notice given in conformity with or pursuant to
the provisions hereof, the Borough, through its own agents, contractors
and/or employees, may cause the system, unit or device to be repaired
or upgraded as necessary at the owner's sole expense. The cost and
expense thereof shall be certified to the Borough Solicitor, who shall
enter the same as a lien against the property in the Court of Common
Pleas and shall proceed to collect the same in like manner as other
municipal claims are by law collectible. An action of assumpsit may be
brought to recover the same in the name of the Borough from the
owner.
D. It has been determined by the Borough that the construction and
maintenance of any building or structure, or part thereof, that
interferes with the Borough Police Department and county operational
telecommunications networks constitutes a nuisance, per se, because it
threatens the health, safety and welfare of the residents and visitors to
the Borough of Catasauqua. In addition to any other remedies or
enforcement procedures provided herein, the Borough of Catasauqua
may seek an injunction to restrain such a nuisance.

equipment and substandard living and health conditions; and
F. A system of inspection and licensing with respect to residential rental
units will assist in maintaining the accuracy of tax records; and
G. With respect to boardinghouses, because of shorter lease terms and the
transient nature of the same, the above considerations are of equal, if
not increased importance and relevancy to the operation of
boardinghouses in the Borough; and

Enforcement Officer shall have authority to apply for an
administrative search warrant to enter and inspect the premises
and/or a regulated rental unit located thereon.
B. Violation notices.
(1) The Code Enforcement Officer shall provide written notification of
violations of this chapter and require that they be corrected within
a reasonable time period as set forth in the notice.
(2) The Code Enforcement Officer may determine that the regulated
rental unit is unfit for human habitation, in which case he shall
order that it be vacated and remain vacated until the situation is
corrected. In such instance, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
§ 207-6 CATASAUQUA CODE § 207-7
170:286
issue to the owner, manager and each occupant a violation notice
detailing the grounds for determining that the unit is unfit.
(3) For serious violations that do not require that the regulated rental
unit or premises be immediately vacated, the Code Enforcement
Officer may require that the violations be corrected within a period
of time no less than 24 hours.
C. Nonrenewal.
(1) The Code Enforcement Officer shall deny an application for
renewal of a rental license if there are outstanding violations of this
chapter or other Borough ordinances or codes relating to the
premises. If such violations do not pose a threat to the safety of
occupants or other members of the public, the Code Enforcement
Officer may permit the current occupant(s) to continue to reside in
the premises for a reasonable period of time as set forth in the
notice of nonrenewal. Any such violations must be corrected within
the time limit set forth in such notice.
(2) The Code Enforcement Officer may issue a temporary rental license
conditioned upon certain actions being taken to remedy a defect or
violation of this chapter or other Borough ordinances or codes
relating to the premises by a date certain.
D. Revocation. The Code Enforcement Officer shall revoke a rental license
for the premises or a regulated rental unit if he determines that
violations of this chapter or other Borough ordinances or codes relating
to the premises present an immediate threat to the safety of occupants
or other members of the public, at which time the owner shall take
immediate steps to remove the occupants and to locate alternative
housing for the occupants. The revocation shall remain in effect until all
such violations are corrected and the premises or unit have been
reinspected and approved.
E. Suspension. The Code Enforcement Officer may suspend a rental
license until violations of this chapter or other Borough ordinances or
codes relating to the premises are corrected and require that such
violations be corrected by a date certain. A failure to timely correct any
or all such violations constitutes grounds for revocation or nonrenewal
of the rental license.
F. Criteria for applying sanctions. The Code Enforcement Officer, when
deciding upon the sanctions provided for in this chapter, shall consider
the following:
(1) The effect of the violation on the health and safety of the
occupant(s) of the regulated rental unit, other occupants of the
premises, and neighboring residents;
§ 207-7 JUNKYARDS § 207-7
170:287
(2) Whether the owner has committed prior violations of this chapter,
and whether those violations were satisfactorily corrected in a
timely manner;
(3) The effect of sanctions upon the occupant(s), particularly when the
occupant(s) did not cause the violation; and
(4) The actions taken by the owner to remedy the violation(s) and to
prevent future violations, including any written plan submitted by
the owner and good faith efforts of the owner to bring the premises
or regulated rental unit into compliance.
G. Conditions. In addition to applying and enforcing sanctions as set forth
in this chapter, the Code Enforcement Officer may establish reasonable
conditions upon the reissuance or reinstatement of a rental license to
an owner consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter.
H. Grounds for imposing sanctions. Any of the following shall subject an
owner to sanctions as provided for in this section:

established in the notice;
(2) Refusal of an owner, manager or occupant to permit the inspection
of the premises or regulated rental unit by a Code Enforcement
Officer as required by this chapter;
(3) Failure to take steps to remedy and/or stop violations of this
chapter by occupants of regulated rental units as required by this
chapter; and
(4) Failure to evict an occupant(s) after having been directed to do so
by a Code Enforcement Officer as provided for in this chapter.
I. Procedure for nonrenewal, suspension or revocation of license.
(1) Following a determination that grounds for nonrenewal,
suspension or revocation of a rental license exist, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall provide written notice to the owner or
manager of the action to be taken and the reason(s) therefor.
(2) The written notice required by this subsection shall include at least
the following information:

PROHIBITED DISCHARGE LEVEL  For purpose of the protective
surcharge program, a level above which a user is not allowed to
71.Editor's Note: See Ch. A285, Fees.
72.Editor's Note: See Ch. A285, Fees.
§ 210-12 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-15
170:298
discharge, based on concentration and/or mass for any parameter
which the Borough believes has the potential to cause pass through,
interference, NPDES violations or any other operating problems. The
prohibited discharge level is also known as the cease and desist level.
SINGLE EVENT SURCHARGE  A flat rate surcharge for each
parameter in a high strength discharge not covered by quarterly
surcharges.
SLUDGE PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS  The maximum
concentration of pollutants allowable in wastewater discharges to the
wastewater treatment plant, which are calculated to ensure the
greatest opportunities for the plant to dispose of its sludge in the most
efficient and economic means available.
STRENGTH FACTOR (SF)  The strength factor compensates for the
additional plant capacity utilized and the increased operating expenses
from accepting wastes at or over the action level. The SF will be 1.0
below the action level and 2.0 for wastes at or above the action level
with prior Borough approval.
SURCHARGE  An additional amount levied against a discharger to
the Catasauqua wastewater treatment system whether located within
the Borough or in one of the contributing communities, imposed as a
result of sampling results indicating a discharge above an enumerated
level.
SURCHARGE SAMPLING MANHOLE  An approved sampling
manhole purchased and/or installed by the user, with provision for flow
measurement.
B. Protective surcharge program.
(1) General purpose. The protective surcharge program is established
to regulate discharges to the wastewater treatment system and
plant which have characteristics, and/or strengths, which require
additional treatment, additional plant capacity or could cause pant
upsets, NPDES violations or other operating problems. The
program establishes levels of discharge for various parameters and
provides a table for calculating the surcharge to be levied at
various thresholds of discharge. The program also authorizes the
Borough to prohibit discharges of certain materials.
(2) Surcharge schedule and formula.
(a) The formula for calculating the average waste load surcharge
is:
QS = CONC(mg/l) x FLOW(MG) x 8.34 x SF x R
Where:
QS =Quarterly surcharge for each surchargeable
parameter.
§ 210-15 JUNKYARDS § 210-15
170:299
CONC =The surchargeable concentration, the
difference between the effluent concentration
and the surcharge level in mg/l.
FLOW =The total quarterly flow in millions of gallons.
8.34 =The conversion factor from mg/l to pounds.
SF =The strength factor.
R =Surcharge rate.

(See Note 1)
Table Notes:
1. The surcharge rates are established by Borough Council
by resolution from time to time.
2. Surcharges from other parameters may be adopted by
resolution at a later date.
3. In situations where BOD and/or NH3 - N are not
representative of the strength of industrial and
commercial discharges, surcharges for COD and/or TKN
may be substituted. Since some materials can vary
widely in treatability and toxicity, the discharge of any
materials within the above limits that the Borough
believes cannot be treated effectively or will cause other
problems, can be restricted or prohibited.
4. In addition to the surcharges calculated from the above
table the cost of sampling and analysis will be added
to the invoice. Fees for source identification and control
may also be included.
(3) Single event surcharge.
(a) A minimum of one sample is required to access a single event
surcharge. These surcharges apply regardless of the quantity
discharged. For each parameter over the surcharge level the
single event surcharge shall be calculated according to the
following schedule:
[1] Up to twice the surcharge level: one times event rate.
§ 210-15 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-15
170:300
[2] Over twice the surcharge level: two times event rate.
[3] Over the action level: four times event rate.
[4] Over the prohibited level: eight times event rate.
(b) The event rate shall be established by resolution of Borough
Council from time to time.73
(c) In addition to the surcharges calculated from the above table
the cost of sampling and analysis will be added to the invoice.
Fees for source identification and control may also be included.
(4) General regulations.
(a) The payment of a surcharge is not an authorization for
discharge. Discharges are only authorized by permit or permit
amendment. Unauthorized discharges will be surcharged and
may also be subject to enforcement action. Enforcement action
may also be taken for each parameter exceeding the action or
prohibited levels. Discharges of the prohibited level must
immediately cease.
(b) Total prohibitions. In cases where the Borough believes that a
material could cause problems at very low levels due to its
toxicity and/or treatability, the prohibited level will be set at
zero and no discharge will be permitted.
(c) When an action level is reached, the Borough will make a
decision based on the specific circumstances ranging from
allowing the discharge to continue, to requiring pretreatment,
to a temporary or permanent prohibition. Discharges above the
action level are prohibited unless specifically approved by the
Borough in writing. The Borough will only approve a discharge
above the action level if the user demonstrates to the
Borough's satisfaction that the discharge will not cause
problems. When a discharge exceeds the action level, the
Borough may also require pretreatment, issue a temporary or
permanent discharge prohibition, or take other action as
deemed necessary, including the establishment of a schedule
for the user to bring its discharge into compliance with the
action level.
(d) Flow equalization will be required for large variations in flow
rates and/or pollutants concentration. Flow equalization is not
the same as dilution of waste discharges, which are not
allowed.
(5) Sampling and analysis costs for surcharges. The costs for sampling
and analysis will be added to the surcharge.
73.Editor's Note: See Ch. A285, Fees.
§ 210-15 JUNKYARDS § 210-15
170:301
(6) Random sampling. The Borough will conduct sampling without
notifying the user. The users must grant twenty-four-hour sampling
access to the site as specified by Borough ordinance. Sampling
points must be located outside any buildings unless the Borough is
given permission in writing for unrestricted access without
notification and/or interference.
(7) Surcharge sampling. The Borough will collect either timeproportioned
composite samples or grab samples depending on the
types of sampling point, which in many cases, will be a sewer
cleanout. Where necessary, a single grab may be used. In certain
instances, the Borough may require the installation of an approved
sampling manhole with recording flow measuring equipment
(compatible with Borough sampling equipment) so flow
proportional composite sampling can be used.
(8) Source identification and control fees. When unusual and/or
problem discharges are detected in the collection system, at the
treatment plant or in the plant's effluent to the river, the Borough
must try to identify and control these discharges. The identification
and control activities can be time consuming and expensive, at
times requiring the use of outside consultants, contract
laboratories, engineers and attorneys. When a probable source (or
sources) of discharges causing actual or potential problems is
identified, the Borough will assess a fee to cover its identification
and control expenses. (For example: Sampling and analysis costs,
administrative time and consultant and attorney fees.) The
minimum fee for these extras services will be as set from time to
time by resolution of Borough Council.74 Based on the
circumstances of the incident, an enforcement action may also be
initiated.75
(9) Responsibility for surcharges. In the event that the materials
qualifying for a surcharge are found in the effluent from multitenant
building without sampling points for each occupant, the
individual or firm whose name appears on the water/sewer bill (for
example: landlord, building owner or management company) will
be responsible for the surcharge.
(10) Responsibility for pollutant discharges. In the event that the
materials harmful to the environment and/or in violation of federal,
state and local government rules and regulations are found in the
effluent from a multi-tenant building (without individual sampling
points for each occupant) the individual or firm whose name
appears on the water/sewer bill will be held responsible for taking
action to control the source and will be subject to the actions listed
in the Enforcement Response Plan.

(11) Sampling for average surcharges. A minimum of three samples,
collected on either consecutive or nonconsecutive days are
required. Any screening sampling done may count as part of the
total sampling required. Sampling times may be based on the site's
operating schedule. Resampling will be done at least annually.
Resampling can be requested when a documented and approved
changed discharge occurs.
(12) Revised surcharges, action and prohibited levels. Surcharges,
action and prohibited levels can be revised by ordinance and/or
permit amendment based on operating experience and
environmental impact.
(13) Allocation of plant capacity. The Borough can allocate and/or limit
the amount of any material discharges as necessary.
(14) Request for information on discharge volumes. The user will be
sent a request requiring that copies of the water bill(s) for the
previous six months be sent to the Borough within 15 days. The
number of operating days during each billing period must be
marked clearly on each bill. Other information may also be
requested. If the water bill(s) is/are not furnished within 15 days,
the Borough will estimate the flow for calculating the surcharge.
Adjustments may be made after the water bill(s) or other flow data
has been received.
(15) Alternative methods of effluent flow measurement. If there are
reasons why using the water bill data will not serve as a measure of
effluent flow, the user should propose a suitable alternative method
to the Borough. Any method approved must be installed at the
user's expense.
(16) Adjustments/questions. If adjustments are requested or there are
any questions about the surcharges, a written request for review
should be submitted to the Pretreatment Coordinator within 30
days of imposition of the surcharge(s).
(17) Failure to pay. Those that fail to pay surcharges after two notices,
will be issued a civil penalty or a summons to appear before the
District Justice. The Borough has the option to issue "Letters of
Violation" instead of notices.
(18) Split samples. When requested, the Borough will split samples as
outlined below. The Borough reserves the right to obtain QA/QC
Data from the user's lab before agreeing to split. The Borough also
reserves the right to split with a referee lab. If a referee lab is used,
the sewer user will be billed for half the costs. The results from all
participating labs will be averaged, if statistically relevant.
(19) Procedures for splitting samples. To assure a random sample, the
Borough will notify the sewer user only on the day of sample
collection. The users designated contact will be notified a minimum

of one hour prior to sample collection. Persons (either in the user's
employ or the user's contract lab) must use a "Chain of Custody"
form and keep it on file for one year. If the user's representative
does not show up within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, the
Borough has no obligation to split the sample.
A. Volume of all water consumed, to be used for billing sewage service
charges under this article, shall include water purchased from the
water company plus water obtained from sources other than the water
company and shall be determined:
(1) From meters installed and maintained by the water company; or
(2) From meters approved by the Borough but installed and
maintained by the property owner; or
(3) From estimates or measurements made by the Borough in
situations where meters are inaccurate or inoperative.
B. Where a single meter is used to measure water supplied to two or more
premises, properties or establishments, the quantity of water used will
be divided equitably to each of such premises, properties or
establishments for billing purposes.
A. Noncontaminated waste waters and waters which are used solely for
cooling purposes shall be excluded from the sewer system and the
sewer rental charge will be based on water metered, less water so
excluded at the rates provided for in this article. Similar credit may be
allowed for water consumed in connection with steam generation or
other purposes where no sewage or wastes result. The volume of water
excluded from the sewer system may be determined from meters
installed and maintained by the industrial establishment or from
estimates or measurements made by the Borough or the industrial
establishment may elect to measure the volume of wastes actually
discharged into the sewer system. For this purpose, any industrial
establishment, at its own expense, may install and maintain a recording
and totalizing flow meter approved by the Borough for measuring the

B. Any industrial establishment which, after taking advantage of this
section, bypasses or otherwise interferes with the correct measurement
of sewage, shall be backfilled for all previous credits and thereafter
deprived of the benefits of this section.
A. All sewer bills not paid within 30 days from the date of billing shall have
an additional sum of 15% added to the bill.
B. If the sewer bill for a property shall remain unpaid for a period of 60
days from the date of billing, formal notice to the owner thereof that the
Borough will institute procedures to place a lien against the property
for the unpaid bill, will be sent. 15 days after the letter has been sent, if
no payment has been received, then the Solicitor shall be notified to
immediately file a lien against said property and proceed under the
"Municipal Claims and Liens Act" to collect the sum due and owing.
C. All persons whose properties are connected to the sewer system must
give the Borough their correct address. Failure to receive bills will not
be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor permit an extension of the
period during which bills are payable at face.

Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be
approved in writing by the approving authority before installation.
L. When a public sewer becomes available, the building sewer shall be
connected to said sewer within 90 days, but if the building sewer shall
be declared a health hazard by the Borough Health Officer, the building
sewer shall be immediately connected to the public sewer. At the time
of connection, the private sewage disposal system shall be cleaned of
sludge filled with approved material.
M. The owner of any improved property shall maintain and repair the
building drain, the building sewer, and lateral from the boundary of the
property to the building at his own expense, and he shall remove all
trees, tree roots and other obstructions to the building drain, the
building sewer and the lateral up to the property owner's boundary line.
The Borough of Catasauqua shall maintain and repair the lateral from
the public main or street sewer to the owner's property line at the
Borough's expense and shall remove all trees, tree roots and other
obstructions to the lateral.
N. It shall be unlawful for any party to discharge into the sewage system
operated by the Borough of Catasauqua any waste or materials which is
in violation of federal law or Environmental Protection Agency
regulations. Promulgated as of now or in the future, including federal
pretreatment standards.
A. Prohibitions on wastewater discharges.
(1) No user shall discharge or deposit or cause or allow to be
discharged or deposited into the wastewater treatment system any
wastewater which contains the following:
(a) Oils and grease.
[1] Oil and grease concentrations or amounts from industrial
facilities violating federal pretreatment standards.
§ 210-25 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-26
170:318
[2] Wastewater from industrial facilities containing floatable
fats, wax, grease or oils.
[3] Any oils in amounts that will cause pass through or
interference are prohibited.
(b) Fire/explosive hazard. Liquids, solids or gases which by reason
of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either
alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or
explosion or be injurious in any other way to the wastewater
treatment system or to the operation of the system. At no time
shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at
the point of discharge into the sewer system, be more than 5%
nor any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit
(LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not
limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene,
zylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides,
chlorates, perchalorates, bormates, carbides, hydrides and
sulfides. Any waste streams with a closed cup flash point of less
than 140° Fahrenheit or 60° Celsius using test methods
specified in 40 CFR § 261.21.
(c) Noxious material. Noxious or malodorous solids, liquids or
gases, which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes,
are capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life, or
are or may be sufficient to prevent entry into a sewer for its
maintenance and repair.
(d) Improperly shredded garbage. Garbage that has not been
ground or comminuted to such a degree that all particles will
be carried freely in suspension under flow conditions normally
prevailing in the public sewers, with no particle greater than 1/
2 inch in any dimension.
(e) Radioactive wastes. Radioactive wastes or isotopes of such
half-life or concentration that they do not comply with
regulations or orders issued by the appropriate federal and
state agencies having control over their use and which will or
may cause damage or hazards to the sewage facilities or
personnel operating system.
(f) Solid or viscous wastes. Solid or viscous wastes which will or
may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer, or otherwise
interfere with the proper operation of the wastewater
treatment system. Prohibited materials include, but are not
limited to, grease, uncomminuted garbage, animal guts or
tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings,
entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent
lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass
clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood,
§ 210-26 JUNKYARDS § 210-26
170:319
plastic, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or
processing of fuel or lubricating oil, and similar substances.
(g) Excessive discharge rate. Wastewater at a flow rate or
containing such concentrations or quantities of pollutants that
exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than
five times the average twenty-four-hour concentration,
quantities or flow during normal operation and that would
cause a treatment process upset and subsequent loss of
treatment efficiency; or the introduction of any pollutant,
including oxygen-demanding pollutants (such as BOD),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which would cause interference with the POTW.
(h) Toxic substances. Any toxic substances in amounts exceeding
standards promulgated by the Administrator of the United
States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section
307(a) of the Act, and chemical elements or compounds,
phenols or other taste or odor-producing substances, or any
other substances which are not susceptible to treatment or
which may interfere with the biological processes or efficiency
of the treatment system, or that will pass through the system.
(i) Unpolluted waters. Any unpolluted water including, but not
limited to, cooling water or of stormwater origin.
(j) Colored discharge. If a nondomestic discharge causes unusual
color in the treatment plants influent samples, the wet well or
the primary clarifier inlets, the colored discharge is prohibited
and must be ceased. BMPs to control color can be required.
[Amended 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(k) Corrosive wastes. Any waste which will cause corrosion or
deterioration of the treatment system. All wastes discharged to
the public sewer system must have a pH value in the range of 6
to 9 standard units. Prohibited materials include, but are not
limited to, acids, sulfides, concentrated chloride and fluoride
compounds and substances which will react with water to form
acidic products.
(l) Interference. Any waste which would cause interference with
the biological processes or efficiency of the treatment system
as defined in this article.
(m) Pass through. Any waste which constitutes a pass through of
the system as defined in this article.
(n) Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Borough in accordance with § 210-27H.
(o) Temperature. Any wastewater having a temperature that will
inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in
§ 210-26 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-26
170:320
interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the
temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to
exceed 104° Fahrenheit (40° Celsius).
(p) Any sludges, screenings or other residues from the
pretreatment of industrial waste.
(q) Any medical waste, except as specifically authorized by the
Borough Manager in a wastewater discharge permit.
(r) Any wastewater causing the treatment plant's effluent to fail a
toxicity test.
(s) Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents or
other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the
POTW.
(t) Toxic gases/vapors/fumes. Pollutants which result in the
presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a
quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety
problems.
(2) Wastes prohibited in this section shall not be processed or stored in
such a manner that they would be discharged to the POTW. All floor
drains located in process or material storage areas must discharge
to the industrial user's pretreatment facility before connecting with
the POTW.
B. Proactive control of influent pollutants of concern must be given a high
priority. Wastewater entering the treatment plant is treated by
biological organisms growing in slime like biofilms which are
susceptible to inhibition or destruction from relatively small amounts of
toxic influent materials. The plant does not have flow equalization
which increases the risk of harm from short-duration, higherconcentration
influent loadings. Very small amounts of biotoxic
materials, such as biocides, bactericides, herbicides and pesticides can
cause aquatic toxicity and inhibit or kill the plants biological treatment
processes. Therefore both the Borough and nondomestic users have a
responsibility to identify actual or potential biotoxics to prevent
problems such as process interference, sludge quality, aquatic toxicity,
personnel and public exposure, collection system issues, regulatory
compliance, and water quality because discharges to the Lehigh River
are under the special protection waters rules. Each industrial user is
limited on the concentration of pollutants allowed to be discharged as
hereinafter detailed. The controlling limit is the lesser of the local limit
or the federal categorical pretreatment standard for each pollutant.
Dilution of any wastewater for the purpose of meeting the limits
hereinafter described, or the local limits or federal categorical
pretreatment standards, shall be considered a violation of this article.

§ 210-26 JUNKYARDS § 210-26
170:321
(1) The following are the maximum concentrations of pollutants
allowable, the action level guidelines for pollutants of concern and
surcharge levels of pollutants of concern in wastewater discharges
to the wastewater treatment system. Development of these limits
and levels was done taking into account the existing loading on our
sludge of these pollutants, plant efficiency and total combined flow
from all industrial discharges. These local limits will be reviewed
periodically and may change as a result of changes in the factors
contributing to their development. If such changes are made in the
local limits for pollutants of concern, these changes, with the
required EPA approvals, can be adopted and used in new or revised
permits without further ordinance revisions.

NOTES:
1 In situations where, in the Borough's opinion, BOD is not
representative of the strength of industrial and commercial
discharges, and/or COD tests are better for process control
purposes, testing for COD may be substituted for testing for BOD.
Where monitoring for COD is required in a permit or permit
amendment, the permittee will usually not be required to monitor
for BOD. However, if there is a need to know the site's BOD
loading as a percentage of the plant's design capacity, testing for
both BOD and COD may be required.

Discharges over the prohibited level are not allowed at any time
and must be ceased.
(a) Action level appeal process. The numerical action levels are
guidelines that when exceeded indicate that a CAP is
necessary. The submission of an acceptable CAP is an
enforceable permit condition. If the sewer user believes that
the action level is not appropriate or that a CAP is not
necessary, the user can petition the Borough for
reconsideration by submitting additional information to the
Pretreatment Coordinator to justify the change. If in the
Borough's opinion the data submitted is not sufficient to make
a determination, the discharge above the action level may be
temporarily or permanently denied. In instances where the
Borough must use an outside consultant to evaluate the
information submitted, the user must first agree to compensate
the Borough for the estimated consultant fees. When the
Borough has determined that discharges over the action level
are not acceptable, all such discharges must be ceased or the
permit can be revoked and service terminated. The permit can
also be amended to exclude any discharges of the specific
materials exceeding the action level.
(2) Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Any categorical
industry discharging to the POTW must also comply with the
categorical industrial limits established by EPA. There are too many
types of categorical industries for the federal categorical
pretreatment standards to be listed here. Any industrial user which
would be regulated under the categorical pretreatment standards
will have those standards listed in its industrial discharge permit.
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR, Chapter
I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, are incorporated by reference
herein.
(3) Best management practices for additional pollutants of concern.
Enforceable best management practices are required for
discharges containing significant amounts of materials such as
arsenic, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, silver,
toxics, biocides, dissolved solids, and any material which in the
§ 210-26 JUNKYARDS § 210-26
170:323
Boroughs opinion is a POC because it will cause or have the
potential to cause environmental problems such as those listed in
action levels. BMPs must be preapproved before any discharges
will be authorized and will be enforceable permit conditions.
[Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
C. Special agreements. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Borough and any user of the wastewater treatment system whereby
wastewater of unusual strength or character is accepted into the
system and specially treated to be acceptable, subject to any payments
or user charges as may be applicable. Local standards set forth in this
article may be waived by special agreement but this provision does not
allow waiver of any national pretreatment standards.
(1) Any special agreement is prohibited from waiving any other federal
retreatment requirements. [Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(2) One of the conditions of any special agreement is that the total
loading for any pollutant allocated to all users does not exceed the
maximum allowable industrial loading calculated as part of the
most recently accepted local limits evaluation. [Added 4-1-2013
by Ord. No. 1287]
(3) Any special agreement must be entered into and authorized in
writing. [Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
D. Concentrations. Concentrations apply at the point where industrial
waste is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic
substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. At his
discretion, the Borough Manager may impose mass limitations in
addition to or in place of the concentration based limitations set forth
above in Subsection B of this section.
E. Dilution. No industrial user shall ever increase the use of the process
water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with
a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable
pretreatment standard or requirement. The Borough Manager may
impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
F. Sludge protection requirements (SPR's). [Added 11-3-2003 by Ord.
No. 1158]
(1) The following are the maximum sludge protection requirement
levels allowable in wastewater discharges to the wastewater
treatment plant. Each industrial or commercial user actively
discharging pollutants that could accumulate in the sludge must
comply with the SPR's. If the discharge level exceeds the SPR's, the
user must develop a plan to come into compliance within a
§ 210-26 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-26
170:324
reasonable period of time as approved by the Borough of
Catasauqua or cease discharging the problem waste stream.

permit, an emended permit or a letter of approval (which requires
a submission of a permit application or a notification of changed
discharge).
A. Regulatory actions. If wastewaters containing any substance described
in § 210-26 of this article are discharged or proposed to be discharged
into the sewer system of the Borough of Catasauqua or any sewer
system which is tributary thereto, or if the industrial user due to plant
setup or chemical storage considerations might require a slug/spill
prevention plan regardless of what they are or plan to be discharging,
the Borough Manager and the Borough Solicitor shall take all actions
against the user necessary to:
(1) Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.
(2) Require a user to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will
reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity
with this article.
(3) Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow
equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable
characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate
these rules and regulations.
(4) Require the user making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay
any additional cost or expense incurred by the Borough for
handling and treating excess loads imposed on the treatment
system.
(5) Where the Borough Manager determines that an emergency
condition exists requiring the immediate cessation of an offending
discharge into the sewer system, the Borough Manager shall
proceed as follows:
(a) He shall immediately notify the offending user of the situation
and order him to immediately stop the discharge.
(b) If the offender fails to respond to the Borough Manager's order,
the Borough Manager is empowered to do all acts necessary
including shutting off any flow from the offending user to the
sewer system. Wherever practical, the Borough Manager
should give the offending user a second notice just prior to
terminating their flow into the system.
(c) If an offending user feels aggrieved by either actions of the
Borough Manager, he may immediately appeal for a hearing
before Borough Council. Borough Council shall hold a hearing
within 48 hours after request of the same and shall either
§ 210-26 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-27
170:326
affirm the Borough Manager's decision, reverse the decision,
or modify the same.
(d) It is the intent of this provision that the Borough Manager be
given all necessary powers to terminate immediately any
discharges which create emergency conditions which may
present an imminent danger to the health or welfare of persons
or society and/or which may do damage to the sewage
treatment facility.
B. Submission of plans. Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater
flows prior to discharge into any part of the wastewater
treatment system is required, plans, specifications and other pertinent
data or information relating to such pretreatment or flow-control
facilities shall first be submitted to the Borough Manager for review
and approval. Such approval shall not exempt the discharge or such
facilities from compliance with any applicable code, ordinance, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any subsequent
alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow control facilities,
or changes to polluted discharges shall not be made without due notice
and prior approval of the Borough Manager, and the issuance of a new
or modified permit as required.
C. Pretreatment facilities operations. If pretreatment or control of waste
flows is required, such facilities shall be maintained in good working
order and operated as efficiently as possible by the owner or operator at
his own cost and expense, subject to the requirements of these rules
and regulations and all other applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
D. Admission to property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes
of these rules and regulations, the Borough Manager, upon the
presentation of credentials, may enter upon any property or premises at
reasonable times for the purpose of copying any records required to be
kept under the provisions of this article, inspecting any monitoring
equipment or method, and sampling any discharge of wastewater to the
treatment works. The Borough Manager may enter upon the property
at any hour under emergency circumstances.
E. Protection from accidental discharge. Each user shall provide
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
wastes regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at
the owner or operator's cost and expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures and any subsequent modifications
thereto to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Borough
Manager for review by the Borough Engineer, and shall be approved by
the Borough Engineer before construction of the facility. Cost of this
review shall be paid by the user. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility
to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
article. Any industrial user required to develop and implement an
§ 210-27 JUNKYARDS § 210-27
170:327
accidental discharge/control slug plan shall submit a plan which
addresses at a minimum the following:
(1) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges.
(2) Description of stored chemicals.
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental
or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any
discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges in
§ 210-26 of this article.
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants
(including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
F. Reporting of accidental discharge. If, for any reason, a facility does not
comply with or will be unable to comply with any publication or
limitations in this article, the user responsible for such discharge shall
immediately notify the Borough Manager so that corrective action may
be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a written report
addressed to the Borough Manager detailing the date, time and cause
of the accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the
discharge and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges,
shall be filed by the responsible facility within five days of the
occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.
G. Tenant responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to
any other person or as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if
either the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may
be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this article.
H. Hauled wastewater.
(1) Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW at a designated
receiving structure within a treatment plant area, and at such
times as are established by the Borough Manager; provided, such
wastes do not violate other sections of this article or any other
requirement established or adopted by the Borough. Wastewater
discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such facility shall
be issued by the Borough Manager.
(2) The discharge of hauled industrial waste, as "industrial septate,"
requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from
the Borough. The Borough Manager shall have authority to prohibit
the disposal of such wastes, if such disposal would interfere with
§ 210-27 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-27
170:328
the treatment plant operation. Waste haulers are subject to all
other sections of this article.
(3) Fees for dumping septate will be established as part of the
industrial user fee system as authorized under this article.
I. Vandalism. No person shall maliciously or willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment or other part of the POTW. Any
person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the
sanctions set out in § 210-30.
J. Responsibility for environmental compliance and pollutant discharges.
[Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(1) Responsibility for environmental compliance. The industrial or
commercial user named on a municipal water/sewer bill ("named
user") is responsible for compliance with federal, state, and local
and environmental rules, regulations and ordinances. Each
occupant at that address also has the same responsibilities and
must have a watershed protection permit to discharge. If violations
and/or environmental problems occur at a multioccupant site and
the occupant responsible does not take immediate corrective action
or cannot be positively identified, the named user shall be fully
responsible for correcting all of the site's noncompliance and
pollution issues and is subject to all enforcement options. When
required by the Borough, the named user must apply for and be
issued a watershed protection permit for the entire site.
(2) Responsibility for pollutant discharges.
(a) Responsibility for pollutant discharges from single-occupant
sites. The occupant must obtain a Level I, II or III watershed
protection permit before commencing any discharges. In the
event that materials harmful to the environment and/or in
violation of federal, state and local government rules and
regulations are found in the effluent, the occupant and, if
necessary, the named user, will be held responsible for taking
action to control the source and any costs of remediation for
any damages caused and will be subject to all actions in the
enforcement response plan.
(b) Responsibility for pollutant discharges from multiple-occupant
sites. Each occupant must obtain a Level I, II or III watershed
protection permit before commencing any discharges. In the
event that materials harmful to the environment and/or in
violation of federal, state and local government rules and
regulations are found in the effluent of a multioccupant
building (without individual sampling points for each
occupant) and the occupant responsible for the discharge
cannot be identified, the named user will be held responsible
§ 210-27 JUNKYARDS § 210-27
170:329
for taking action to control the source and any costs of
remediation for any damages caused and will be subject to all
actions in the enforcement response plan.
(3) Responsibility for the costs of compliance.
(a) Watershed protection permit application costs. Each sewer
user proposing to discharge new pollutants or increased levels
of previously approved pollutants is responsible for all of the
application costs, including but not limited to sampling,
laboratory tests and consultant services.
(b) Permit compliance costs. Each permitted sewer user is
responsible for the costs of sampling, analysis and any other
expenses required to comply with the site's permit.
(c) Additional analysis and testing. If a sewer user discharges any
pollutant which requires additional sampling, analysis and
other tests, the sewer user is responsible for the additional
costs.
(d) Site-specific NPDES permit and pretreatment compliance
costs. If a sewer user discharges any material for which the
DEP and EPA specifies additional or modified NPDES permit
requirements and/or additional pretreatment requirements,
the sewer user is responsible for any additional costs incurred
by the Borough to implement and maintain compliance with
these requirements.
(e) Costs of identification and correction of violations. The sewer
user or users responsible for discharges that cause violations,
harm to the treatment plant and the environment are also
responsible for all extra expenses incurred by the Borough to
locate the sources(s) and take the necessary corrective actions.
If a sewer user, who is not the property owner, is found to be a
source and does not promptly and properly assume these
responsibilities, the named user will be held responsible.
K. Termination of sewer service. [Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(1) All sewage discharges to the Borough's treatment plant must be
terminated on permit expiration or permit revocation or when a
cease and desist order is issued. Permits can be revoked or a cease
and desist order issued for illegal discharges (actual or potential),
NPDES violations and continued noncompliance with permit
requirements, such as local limits, action levels, enforceable BMPs
and/or other applicable local, state and federal environmental
regulations. When there are actual and/or potential adverse effects,
the Borough can immediately terminate sewer service with or
without taking prior enforcement actions. This can be done by
issuing a cease and desist order that will stay in effect until
compliance can be assured. Cease and desist orders will usually be
§ 210-27 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-27
170:330
§ 210-28. Compliance monitoring and reporting. [Amended
1-9-1990 by Ord. No. 951; 11-6-1995 by Ord. No. 1044]
sent by certified mail, but in unusual or emergency situations, they
can be given verbally (in person or over the phone), hand delivered
or sent by fax or e-mail.
(2) Actions that must be taken when sewer service is terminated.
(a) When a permit expires or has been revoked or a cease and
desist order has been issued, the sewer user must terminate all
wastewater discharges to the Borough's WWTP within 15
calendar days. The time to terminate all discharges may be
reduced where there is an indication that imminent harm will
occur. Any further violations found during the period during
which termination of all discharges must occur will be subject
to additional escalating enforcement as serious, willful
violations.
(b) The sewer user must send a termination of discharge
certification letter to the Borough Manager by certified mail as
soon as possible but within 15 calendar days of permit
expiration or receipt of a cease and desist order signed by the
person in charge of the site's operations certifying that all
discharges to the WWTP have been permanently stopped
describing the actions taken so that further discharges cannot
occur. The time frame to submit the termination of discharge
certification letter is separate and independent from the timeframe
to terminate all wastewater discharges set forth in
§ 210-27K(2)(a). If after 16 days this termination of discharge
certification letter has not been received by the Borough, a
civil penalty assessment of no less than $200 per day of
continued illegal discharge will be issued. This daily penalty
may be increased one or more times if illegal discharges
continue and/or the certification letter is not received.
A. Compliance monitoring.
(1) Inspection and sampling. The Borough of Catasauqua shall have
the right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this article, and any permit or order issued
hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial user is
complying with all requirements thereof. Industrial users shall
allow the Borough Manager or his representatives ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any
additional duties.
(a) Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
required proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the industrial user shall make necessary
§ 210-27 JUNKYARDS § 210-28
170:331
arrangement with the security guard so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the
Borough, state and EPA will be permitted to enter without
delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
(b) The Borough, state and EPA shall have the right to set up on
the industrial users property, or require installation of such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering
of the user's operations.
(c) The Borough may require the industrial user to install
monitoring equipment, as necessary. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a
safe and proper operating condition by the industrial user at its
own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated at least semi-annually to insure their
accuracy.
(d) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled
shall be promptly removed by the industrial user at the written
or verbal request of the Borough Manager or his
representative and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the industrial user.
(e) Unreasonable delays in allowing Borough personnel access to
the industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
(2) Search warrants. If the Borough Manager, or his representative,
has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any
part thereof, and if the Borough Manager has demonstrated
probable cause to believe there may be a violation of this article or
that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection
program of the Borough of Catasauqua designed to verify
compliance with this article or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then upon application by the Borough
Solicitor, the Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County
shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the
specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify
what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property
described. Such warrants shall be served at reasonable hours by
the Borough Manager in the company of a uniformed police officer
of the Borough of Catasauqua. In the event of an emergency
affecting public health and safety, inspections shall be made
without the issuance of a warrant.
B. Reporting requirements.
(1) Base line monitoring reports.
§ 210-28 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-28
170:332
(a) Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on
a categorical determination under 40 CFR § 403.6(a)(4),
whichever is later, existing significant industrial users subject
to such categorical pretreatment standards, and currently
discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW, shall be
required to submit to the Borough of Catasauqua a report
which contains the information listed in Subsection B(1)(b),
below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their
discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial
users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the
Borough of Catasauqua a report which contains the
information listed in Subsection B(1)(b), below. A new source
shall also be required to report the method of pretreatment
standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged.
(b) The industrial user shall submit the information required by
this section including:
[1] Identifying information. The name and address of the
facility including the name of the operator and owners.
[2] Wastewater discharge permits. A list of any environmental
control wastewater discharge permits held by or for the
facility.
[3] Description of operations. A brief description of the
nature, average rate of production and standard industrial
classification of the operation(s) carried out by such
industrial user. This description should include a
schematic process diagram which indicates points of
discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
[4] Flow measurement. Information showing the measured
average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day,
to the POTW from regulated process streams and other
streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula set out in 40 CFR § 403.6(e).
[5] Measurement of pollutants.
[a] Identify the categorical pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process.
[b] Submit the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration (and/or mass,
where required by the standard or by the Borough of
Catasauqua) of regulated pollutants in the discharge
from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily
maximum and long term average concentrations (or
§ 210-28 JUNKYARDS § 210-28
170:333
mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample
shall be representative of the normal discharges from
the daily operations occurring during the reporting
period and shall be analyzed in accordance with the
procedures set out in Subsection B(10) of this section.
In cases where the applicable standard requires
compliance with a best management practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by the Borough or the
applicable standard to determine compliance with the
standard. [Amended 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
[c] Sampling must be performed in accordance with the
procedures set out in Subsection B(11).
[6] Certification. A statement used by the industrial user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards
are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether
additional operation and maintenance and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment
standards and requirements.
[7] Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or
O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards;
the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will
provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard. The compliance schedule pursuant
to this section must meet the requirements set out in
§ 210-29D of this article.
[8] All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with § 210-29D(9).
(2) Compliance schedule progress report. The following conditions
shall apply to the schedule required in Subsection B(1)(b)[7]. The
schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment re-required
for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such
events including hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and
final plans, executing contracts for the major components,
commencing and completing construction, beginning and
conducting routine operation). No increment referred to above
shall exceed nine months. The industrial user shall submit a
progress report to the Borough Manager no later than 14 days
following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, (and, if
§ 210-28 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-28
170:334
appropriate) the steps being taken by the industrial user to return
to the established schedule. In no event shall more than nine
months elapse between such progress reports to the Borough
Manager.
(3) Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline.
(a) Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case
of a new source, following commencement of the introduction
of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to
such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Borough a report containing the information described in
Subsection B(1)(b)[4] to [6].
(b) For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in 40 CFR § 403.6(c), this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the industrial user's long term
production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), this report shall include the industrial
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 210-29D(9).
(4) Periodic compliance reports.
(a) Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment
standard shall, at a frequency determined by the Borough
Manager but in no case less than twice per year (in June and
December), submit a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited
by such pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average of maximum daily flows for the reporting
period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with § 210-29D(9). In cases where the
applicable standard requires compliance with a best
management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the
user shall submit documentation as required by the Borough or
the applicable standard to determine compliance with the
standard. [Amended 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(b) All wastewater samples must be representative of the normal
discharges occurring during the reporting period. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at
all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds
§ 210-28 JUNKYARDS § 210-28
170:335
for the industrial user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge. [Amended 4-1-2013 by
Ord. No. 1287]
(c) If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in
and of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in
Subsection B(11) of this article, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in this report.
(5) Report of changed conditions. Each industrial user is required to
notify the Borough Manager of any planned significant changes to
the industrial user's operation or system which might alter the
nature, quality or volume of its wastewater, or impact the potential
for slug discharge, at least 90 days before the change. [Amended
4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(a) The Borough Manager may require the industrial user to
submit such information as may be deemed necessary to
evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a
wastewater discharge permit application under § 210-29B.
(b) The Borough Manager may issue a wastewater discharge
permit under § 210-29C or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit under § 210-29I.
(c) No industrial user shall implement the planned changed
condition(s) until and unless the Borough Manager has
responded to the industrial user's notice.
(d) For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10% or
greater and the discharge of any previously unreported
pollutants shall be deemed significant.
(6) Reports of potential problems.
(a) In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic
nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which
may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a
violation of the prohibited discharge standards in § 210-26 of
this article), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to
immediately telephone and notify the Borough of Catasauqua
of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
(b) Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user
shall, unless waived by the Borough Manager, submit a
detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge
and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
§ 210-28 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-28
170:336
the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources or any other damage to relieve the
industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability
which may be imposed by this article.
(c) Failure to notify the Borough of potential problem discharges
shall be deemed a separate violation of this article.
(d) A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a discharge described in
Subsection B(6)(a), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur
are advised of the emergency notification procedures.
(e) Reports of potential problems as described in this Subsection
B(6) shall also be required within the same time frames and to
the same agencies whenever there are facility changes that
affect the potential for slug discharges. This notification
requirement is in addition to any other requirement relating to
slug discharges contained elsewhere in this Chapter 210.
[Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(7) Reports from nonsignificant industrial users. All industrial users
not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required
to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the Borough as the Borough Manager may require.
(8) Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial
user must notify the Borough within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Borough within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The
industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs
monitoring at the industrial user's premises at least once a month,
or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user's
initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of
the sampling.
(9) Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(a) Any industrial user who commences the discharge of
hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional
Waste Management Division Director and state hazardous
waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of
a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be
hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261. Such notification
must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in
40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
§ 210-28 JUNKYARDS § 210-28
170:337
type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial
user discharges more than 10 kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also include
the following information to the extent such information is
known and readily available to the industrial user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following 12
months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this
subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous
waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
discharges must be submitted under Subsection B(5), above.
The notification requirement in this section does not apply
to pollutant already reported under the self-monitoring
requirements of Subsections B(1), (3) and (4), above.
(b) Discharges are exempt from the requirements of Subsection A
of this section during a calendar month in which they
discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR § 261.30(d) and § 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than 15 kilograms of nonaccute hazardous waste
specified in 40 CFR § 261.30 and § 261.33(3) requires a onetime
notification.
(c) In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or
listing any additional substances as hazardous waste, the
industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorizes of the discharge of such substance within 90
days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to
reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated
to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(10) Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge
permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR, Part 136, does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
(11) Sample collection.
(a) Except as indicated in Subsection B(11)(b), below, the
industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow
§ 210-28 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-28
170:338
proportional composite collection techniques. The Borough
Manager may authorize the use of another sampling technique
as long as the sample is representative of discharge. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance
with instantaneous discharge limits. [Amended 4-1-2013 by
Ord. No. 1287]
(b) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
toxicity, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be
obtained using grab collection techniques.
(12) Determination of noncompliance. The Borough Manager may use a
grab sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment
standards.
(13) Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on
the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage
prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the
date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(14) Recordkeeping. [Amended 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(a) Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements
established in this article shall maintain and make available for
copying records of all information resulting from any
monitoring activities required by this article, including
documentation associated with best management practices.
Such records shall include for all samples:
[1] The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and
the names of the person or persons taking the samples;
[2] The date(s) analyses were performed;
[3] Who performed the analyses;
[4] The analytical techniques/methods used;
[5] The results of such analyses.
(b) Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements
established in this article (including documentation associated
with BMPs) shall be required to retain for a minimum of three
years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether
or not such monitoring activities are required by this section)
and shall make such records available for inspection and
copying by the Borough of Catasauqua. This period of retention
shall be extended during the course of any unresolved
litigation concerning compliance with this article, or where the
industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Borough Manager.

All commercial and industrial users must submit information on the nature
and characteristics of the wastewater, materials stored on site and wastes
sent for off-site disposal, by completing a permit application prior to
commencing any discharge, or within the time frames set forth for existing
users. The Borough Manager is authorized to prepare a form for this
purpose and may periodically require commercial and industrial users to
update their application. Failure to complete the application shall be
reasonable grounds for terminating service to the user and shall be
considered a violation of this article.
(15) Additional monitoring data. Industrial users that monitor more
frequently than required, using appropriate procedure, are
required to submit such monitoring to the POTW. The timing,
procedures and record keeping requirements for such additional
reports shall be the same as for the required reporting.
C. Confidential information. Information and data on an industrial user
obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit
applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs,
and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to
the public without restriction unless the industrial user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough
that the release of such information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state
law. When required and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing
a report that such information should be held confidential, the
proportions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret
processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and
other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR § 2.302 will not be
recognized as confidential information and will be available to the
public without restriction.
A. Wastewater discharge permits required.
(1) All significant industrial users proposing to connect to discharge
into any part of the wastewater treatment system must first obtain
a discharge permit therefor.
(2) All existing significant industrial users connected to or discharging
to any part of the Borough's system must obtain a wastewater
discharge permit within 90 days from and after the effective date of
this article.
§ 210-28 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-29
170:340
(3) Any existing permitted user which changes its discharge must
obtain a discharge permit prior to commencing any changed
discharge.
(4) All nonsignificant industrial users, and all commercial users shall
be required to obtain a water pollution management permit, either
Level II or Level III.
(a) Existing users shall apply for said water pollution management
permit within 180 days of publication of this article.
(b) New users shall apply for and obtain a water pollution
management permit prior to occupancy.
(5) The Borough Manager may require other industrial users,
including liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge
permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article.
B. Permit application. Users seeking a wastewater discharge permit or
seeking a new permit due to revised discharges, shall complete and file
with the Borough Manager an application on a form prescribed by the
Borough Manager and accompanied by the applicable fee. Said
application may require the following general information, as well as
additional user specific information:
(1) Name, address, and SIC number of applicant.
(2) Volume of wastewater to be discharged.
(3) Wastewater constituents and characteristics including, but not
limited to, those set forth in § 210-26 of this article as determined
by a reliable analytical laboratory.
(4) Time and duration of discharge.
(5) Average base water flow rates.
(6) Site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans and details
to show all sewers and appurtenances by size, location and
elevation.
(7) Description of activities, facilities and plant processes on the
premises including all materials and types of materials which are,
or could be, discharged.
(8) Each product produced by type, amount and rate of production.
(9) Number and type of employees and hours of work.
(10) Any other information as may be deemed by the Borough Manager
to be necessary to evaluate the permit application.
(11) All wastewater discharge permit applications and industrial user
reports must contain a certification statement and must be signed
§ 210-29 JUNKYARDS § 210-29
170:341
by an authorized representative of the industrial user. The
language of said certification is set forth below in Subsection D(9)
of this section.
(12) Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and
will be returned to the industrial user for revision.
C. Permit decision. The Borough Manager will evaluate the data furnished
on the application and may require additional information. Properly
completed applications shall automatically serve as Level III permits. At
any time during the term of the Level III permit, if it is determined to be
necessary, the Borough may require a Level I or Level II discharge
permit application to be filed. The Borough Manager may deny any
application for a wastewater discharge permit or revoke an existing
permit for cause. If a determination that a Level I or Level II permit
application is required, the failure of an industrial user to make
application within a time frame set forth in the notice thereof, shall
constitute a violation of this article and shall be reasonable grounds for
terminating service to the industrial user.
D. Permit conditions. Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this article and all other regulations, user
charges and fees established by the Borough. The conditions of
wastewater discharge permits shall be uniformly enforced in
accordance with this article and applicable state and federal
regulations. Permit conditions will include the following:
(1) The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the
wastewater to be discharged to the system.
(2) The average and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics.
(3) Limits on rate and time of discharge or requirements for flow
regulations and equalization.
(4) Requirements for installation of inspection and sampling facilities,
and specifications for monitoring programs.
(5) Requirements for maintaining and submitting technical reports and
plant records relating to wastewater discharges. The individual
reports required shall include, at least, periodic compliance reports
for all industrial users and compliance schedule progress reports,
compliance reports, and baseline monitoring reports for
categorical industries.
(a) Periodic compliance reports. All industrial users must submit a
biannual periodic compliance report. The report shall indicate
the precise nature and concentrations of the regulated
pollutants in its discharge to the POTW, the average and
maximum daily flow rates of the facility, the methods used by
the discharger to sample and analyze the data, and a
§ 210-29 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-29
170:342
certification that these methods confirmed to those methods
outlined in the regulations. [40 CFR 403.12(e)].
(b) Compliance schedule progress reports. No later than 14 days
following each date in the categorical compliance schedule,
the permittee shall submit to the Borough a progress report
including at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the
date on which it expects to comply with the increment of
progress, the reasons for the delay, and the steps being taken
to return the project to the schedule established.
(c) Report on compliance. Within 90 days after the compliance
date for categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a
new source following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to the
standards must submit to the Borough a "Report on
Compliance" that states whether or not applicable
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis.
The report must indicate the nature and concentration of all
regulated pollutants in the facility's regulated process waste
streams; and a statement of whether compliance is
consistently being achieved, and if not, what additional
operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary
to achieve compliance. [40 CFR 403.12(d)].
(d) Baseline monitoring report. All industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards must submit a baseline
monitoring report (BMR) to the Borough within 180 days after
the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard or
180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a
category determination request, whichever is later.
(e) Compliance monitoring. All limits must be complied with, but
periodic monitoring is usually required only for the parameters
that are actively discharged. However, the Borough can
require either temporary screening or periodic monitoring for
any parameter with or without a limit that is believed to have
an actual or potential harmful effect on the plant, its
employees, the public, the sludge, the collection systems and
the Lehigh River. [Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(6) Daily average and daily maximum discharge rates, or other
appropriate conditions when pollutants subject to limitations and
prohibitions are proposed or present in the user's wastewater
discharge.
(7) Compliance schedules.
(8) Best management practices (BMPs). [Added 4-1-2013 by Ord.
No. 1287]
§ 210-29 JUNKYARDS § 210-29
170:343
(a) BMP certification. Those users with BMP requirements in their
permits will be required to certify within 60 days and then
annually that the BMPs are being effectively implemented and
submit all documentation required by the BMP, such as process
control, cleaning, maintenance and off-site disposal of records
which must be kept for at least three years. Copies must be
shown to or sent to the Borough when requested. In the event
that there is a noticeable increase in the treatment plant
influent of a parameter used by a site with a BMP, the Borough
can require immediate monitoring and other actions in
accordance with the applicable monitoring requirements on a
temporary or permanent basis. Failure to comply with an
approved BMP may result in any one or more of the following:
escalating enforcement actions, a temporary or permanent
change in permit level or permit fees, or submission of a new
permit application may be required. In addition sewer service
can be terminated until the user conclusively demonstrates
that a sustainable approved BMP has been adopted and
implemented.
(b) Customized BMPs. A sewer user who believes that a sitespecific
BMP could be more environmentally beneficial and/or
more cost effective than complying with a numerical discharge
limit or action level should contact the Boroughs Pretreatment
Coordinator to determine if a BMP would be appropriate. If the
use of a BMP is found to be suitable the, Borough may work
with the user to plan and implement an enforceable BMP.
(c) Enforceable BMPs for biotoxic materials. Dischargers of
biotoxics must submit BMPs acceptable to the Borough before
commencing any discharges. The BMPs must assure that toxic
amounts of these materials will not be discharged at any time,
or the user must use less toxic materials or zero discharge.
(d) Enforceable BMPs for cyanide dischargers. Dischargers of
cyanide or cyanide-containing materials must implement
enforceable BMPs acceptable to the Borough before
commencing any discharges. The BMPs must include the use of
a preapproved cyanide destruction system that reduces the
total cyanide to nondetect (below a reporting limit of 0.005 mg/
l). In some instances, the Borough may require that, after the
cyanide destruction process, the treated wastewater be held in
sealed and secure containers until the cyanide content has
been tested and found to be <0.005 mg/l; if not the batch must
be retreated.
(e) Enforceable BMPs for oil and grease. All Level I and Level II
permittees discharging FOG (fats or oils or greases or a
combination thereof) must submit a BMP called a "FOG
management plan" for Borough approval.
§ 210-29 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-29
170:344
(9) Signatory requirement. Baseline monitoring reports (BMR's),
reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadlines, ninety-day compliance reports and periodic reports on
continued compliance must be signed and certified by a duly
authorized representative of the industrial user. A duly authorized
representative is one who meets the criteria established at 40 CFR
403.12(1). The signature for these reports must be accompanied by
the following certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a system designed to insure qualified personnel
properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on
my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or
those person directly responsible for gathering the information,
the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including
the possibility of fines and imprisonment for knowing violations."
(10) General sewer use rules and regulations.
(11) A statement of applicable civil, criminal and administrative
penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and
requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such
schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that
required by applicable federal, state or local law, and the statement
of penalties may reference only those set forth hereafter in the
audience.
(12) A statement that compliance with the wastewater discharge permit
does not relieve the permittee of responsibility with compliance
with all applicable state and federal pretreatment standards,
including those which become effective during the term of
discharge permit.
(13) Conditional discharge permits for new or increased POC
discharges or noncompliance. Conditional watershed protection
permits can be issued when, in the Boroughs judgment, it is
necessary to protect the plant and the environment when the
harmful effects of new pollutants or increased amounts of existing
pollutants are not well known, especially when the proposed
influent loadings are substantially higher than the usual
background levels and/or the discharge flow is higher or uneven
throughout the day or has spikes or slug discharges. An existing
permit can also be revoked and reissued as a conditional permit
after a letter of violation and/or a notice that preventive action is
required has been issued because of noncompliance or marginal
compliance with permit requirements. Conditional permits are
valid for a period of up to one year and will only be renewed (either
as a conditional or a multiyear conventional permit) if there is
§ 210-29 JUNKYARDS § 210-29
170:345
satisfactory compliance with the requirements of the permit.
[Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(14) Applicable slug control and slug discharges notification
requirements. [Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(15) Applicable BMP requirements. [Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No.
1287]
(16) Other conditions to ensure compliance with this article. [Added
4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
E. Duration of permits. Permits shall be used for a specified time period,
not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period of less than
one year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. Any permittee
desiring to continue to discharge after the expiration date shall file an
application for reissuance of the permit not less than 120 days prior to
the expiration of the permit. The terms and conditions of the permit
may be subject to modification and change by the Borough Manager
during the life of the permit, as limitations or requirements as identified
in § 210-26 are modified and changed. The user shall be informed of any
proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days prior to the effective
date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall
include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. [Amended
4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(1) Subject to the general provisions on the duration of permits, it is
the intention of this subsection that Level I and Level III permits
shall have terms of up to five years and that Level II permits shall
have terms of up to three years.
(2) Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon nonuse,
cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All
wastewater discharge permits are void upon the issuance of a new
wastewater discharge permit.
F. Transfer of a permit. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit
shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user,
different premises or a new or changed operation.
G. Revocation of permit.
(1) Any user who violates the following conditions of his permit or of
this article, or of applicable state and federal regulations, is subject
to having his permit revoked. Violations subjecting a user to
possible revocation of his permit include, but are not limited to, the
following:
(a) Failure of a user to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his discharge;
§ 210-29 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-29
170:346
(b) Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations,
or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
(c) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring;
(d) Violation of conditions of the permit;
(e) Failure to meet effluent limitations, pay fines, pay sewer
charges, meet compliance schedules, complete a wastewater
survey or the wastewater discharger permit application, or
provide advanced notice of the transfer of a permitted facility;
(f) Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this article.
(2) Procedure for revocation of permit. Whenever the Borough
Manager or his designee finds that any person has violated or is
violating this article, or any prohibition, limitation or requirement
contained herein, and that person has an industrial discharge
permit, the Borough Manager shall inform the user in writing of the
violation(s) pursuant to the enforcement response guide prepared
by the Borough. The user shall be informed of the time in which to
make the necessary corrections. If the corrections are not made
within the time allotted, then the Borough Manager may revoke the
discharge permit. The revocation of industrial discharge permit by
the Borough Manager may be appealed by written request to the
Borough Council within 10 days after the permit has been revoked.
Borough Council shall schedule a hearing thereon and
determination the proprietary of the Borough Manager's decision
for the revocation of said permit.
H. Permit appeals. Any person, including the industrial user, may petition
the Borough to reconsider the terms of the wastewater discharge
permit within 30 days of its issuance. [Amended 4-1-2013 by Ord.
No. 1287]
(1) Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be
a waiver of the administrative appeal.
(2) In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater
discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this
objection and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in
the wastewater discharge permit.
(3) The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be
stayed pending the appeal.
(4) If the Borough fails to act within 30 days, a request for
reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decision not to
reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a
wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater
§ 210-29 JUNKYARDS § 210-29
170:347
discharge permit shall be considered final administrative action for
purposes of judicial review.
(5) Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative
wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a
complaint with the Court of Common Pleas for Lehigh County
within the time frame set forth by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania for filing such appeals.
I. Wastewater discharge permit modification.
(1) The Borough Manager may modify the wastewater discharge
permit for good cause including, but not limited to, the following:
(a) To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements.
(b) To address significant alterations or additions to the industrial
user's operation, processes or wastewater volume or character
since the time of the wastewater discharge permit issuance.
(c) A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized
discharge.
(d) Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a
threat to the Borough's POTW, Borough personnel or the
receiving waters.
(e) Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater
discharge permit.
(f) Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any
required reporting.
(g) Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical
pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR § 403.13.
(h) To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater
discharge permit.
(i) To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation
to a new owner/operator.
(j) New or increased POC discharges as prohibited slug
discharges. When new or increased pollutant loadings, with or
without an action level, substantially exceed the usual
background levels and the effects on the plant and the Lehigh
River are unknown, the Borough can temporarily or
permanently classify them as prohibited slug discharges. The
sewer user or qualified others must provide documentation to
the Borough to demonstrate that the discharge is acceptable
§ 210-29 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-29
170:348
§ 210-30. Enforcement; violations and penalties. [Amended
6-3-1985 by Ord. No. 889; 1-9-1990 by Ord. No. 951; 11-6-1995 by
Ord. No. 1044]
for release to the sewer. Proposals for flow equalization will be
considered. [Added 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
(2) The filing of a request by the permittee for a wastewater discharge
permit modification does not stay any wastewater discharge permit
condition.
A. General enforcement procedures.
(1) The Borough will prepare and adopt an enforcement response
guide for the purpose of assisting in identifying industrial user
noncompliance and responding with the appropriate enforcement
measures. The enforcement response guide will be adopted by
resolution of Borough Council and will be amended or modified
from time to time by resolution of Council. Enforcement options
available to the Borough include suspension of wastewater
treatment service, revocation of industrial discharge permit,
assessment of civil and/or criminal penalties, assessment of
administrative fines and issuance of administrative orders and
court action for injunctive relief.
(2) Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions of this section are not
exclusive remedies. The Borough of Catasauqua reserves the right
to take any, all or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will
generally be in accordance with the Borough's enforcement
response plan. However, the Borough reserves the right to take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the Borough of Catasauqua is empowered to make more
than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These
actions may be taken concurrently.
(3) Annual publication of significant noncompliance. A list of industries
which were in significant noncompliance and/or which were
subject to enforcement proceedings during the previous calendar
year shall be annually published by the Borough in a newspaper of
general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within
the service area. [Amended 4-1-2013 by Ord. No. 1287]
B. Administrative enforcement remedies.
(1) Whenever the Borough Manager finds that any user has violated or
is violating this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the
Borough Manager or his agent may serve upon said user a written
notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
§ 210-29 JUNKYARDS § 210-30
170:349
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Borough Manager.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the Borough of Catasauqua to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement actions, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(2) Consent orders. The Borough Manager is hereby empowered to
enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within
a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have
the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to Subsections B(4) and (5), below, and shall be judicially
enforceable.
(3) Show cause hearing. The Borough Manager may order any user
which causes to contributes to violation(s) of this article,
wastewater discharge permit, or orders issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the
Borough Manager and show cause why a proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally
or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least
20 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user
appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued
following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
(4) Compliance orders. When the Borough Manager finds out a user
has violated or continues to violate the ordinance, wastewater
discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Manager may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance and setting forth a time frame to
achieve compliance. If the user does not come into compliance
within the required time frame, sewer service shall be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. A compliance
order may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not
extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal
§ 210-30 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-30
170:350
pretreatment standard or requirements, nor does a compliance
order release the user of liability from any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
(5) Cease and desist. When the Borough Manager finds out the user is
violating this article, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur,
the Borough Manger may issue an order to the user directing it to
cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(a) Immediately comply with all requirements.
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may
be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the
discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
(6) Emergency suspensions. The Borough Manager may immediately
suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user)
whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Borough Manager may also immediately
suspend the user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to
respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment.
(a) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Borough Manager shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The
Borough Manager shall allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the Borough that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings set forth in Subsection B(7)
are initiated against the user.
(b) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed
written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence to the Borough Manager, prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under Subsection B(3) and
Subsection B(7).
§ 210-30 JUNKYARDS § 210-30
170:351
(c) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(7) Termination of discharge.
(a) The provisions of § 210-29G of this article relating to
revocation of permit for violation of certain conditions of this
article, also apply to any user whether a permit holder or not.
Any user that violates the conditions set forth in § 210-29G is
subject to discharge termination.
(b) Any such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity show cause under
Subsection B(3) of this section why the proposed action should
not be taken.
C. Judicial enforcement remedies.
(1) Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment
standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of
this article, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the Borough
Manager may petition the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County
through the Borough Solicitor for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order
or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the
industrial user. Such other action as appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief may also be brought by the Borough. A petition for
injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any
other action against the user.
(2) Civil penalties. Civil penalties may be assessed against any user
who violates any provision of this article including, but not limited
to, any provision of the pretreatment permit issued under the
provisions of this article. The civil penalty policy as set forth in
Ordinance 1021 of the Borough of Catasauqua,78 which ordinance
is made a part hereof by reference, as if the same were fully set
forth herein.
(3) Criminal prosecution.
(a) Any user that willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this article, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment requirements shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of
not more than $1,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for
not more than 90 days, or both.

A. Upset.
(1) For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond a reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset
does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance
or careless or improper operation.
(2) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
Borough for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the requirements of Subsection A(3), are met.
(3) An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that:
(a) An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset.
§ 210-30 JUNKYARDS § 210-31
170:353
(b) The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with the applicable
operation and maintenance procedures.
(c) The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW treatment operator within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the upset, and if this information is provided orally, a
written submission must be provided within five days:
[1] A description of the indirect discharge and a cause of
noncompliance.
[2] The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue.
[3] Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5) Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards.
(6) The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative
method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
B. General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in § 210-26 of
this article, if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know
that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during
the pass through interference; or
(2) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the
Borough was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and
in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable
sludge use or disposal requirements.
C. Bypass.
§ 210-31 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-31
170:354
(1) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:
BYPASS  The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE  Substantial physical damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable,
or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in
production.
(2) An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it is also for essential maintenance to assure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of
Subsections C(3) and (4), below.
(3) Notice.
(a) If an industrial user knows in advance of the bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
(b) An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the
POTW within 24 hours from the time [he] becomes aware of
that bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within
five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of
the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time [it] is expected to continue; and
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
(4) Prohibited bypass; exceptions.
(a) Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement
action against an industrial user for bypass, unless:
[1] Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage.
[2] There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of
equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in
the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to
§ 210-31 JUNKYARDS § 210-31

§ 210-32. Pretreatment charges and fees. [Amended 9-6-1994 by
Ord. No. 1018; 11-6-1995 by Ord. No. 1044]
The Borough of Catasauqua may adopt reasonable charges and fees for
reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Borough's
pretreatment program which may include:
prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventative maintenance.
[3] The industrial user submitted notices as required under
Subsection C(3) of this section.
(b) The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection C(4)(a) of
this section.
A. Fees for wastewater permit applications including the cost of
processing such application.
B. Fees for wastewater discharge permits, Level I, Level II and/or Level
III.
C. Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures including
the cost of collection and analyzing an industrial user's discharge and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by industrial users.
D. Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction.
E. Fees or filing appeals.
F. Other fees as the Borough may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters
covered in this article and are separate from all other fees, fines and
penalties chargable by the Borough.
G. Said fees shall be calculated in accordance with the schedule of fees
and charges as established by resolution of Borough Council,79 and may
be changed from time to time by resolution of Borough Council.

expressed as a multiple of 100 gallons per day. For nonresidential
customers, at the Borough's sole discretion, design capacity may also be
expressed in pounds of BOD5 per day, pounds of suspended solids per day
or any other capacity-defining parameter that is separately and specifically
set forth in the permit governing the operation of the system, and based
upon its original design as modified by those regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over these facilities.
DESIGN CAPACITY REQUIRED BY A NEW RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER 
The design capacity required by a new residential customer used in
calculating the sewer tapping fees shall not exceed an amount established
by multiplying 90 gallons per capita per day times the average number
of persons per household as established by the most recent census data
provided by the United States Census Bureau. Alternatively, the design
capacity required by a new residential customer shall be determined by a
study, but shall not exceed the average residential water consumption per
residential customer plus 10% or the average sewage flow per residential
customer determined by a measured sewage flow study. Such study shall
be completed in accordance with sound engineering practices within the
most recent five years for the lesser of three or all residential subdivisions
of more than 10 lots which have collection systems in good repair and which
connected to the Borough's facilities within the most recent five years. The
study shall calculate the average sewage flow per residential customer in
such developments by measuring actual flows over at least 12 consecutive
months at the points where such developments connected to the Borough's
sewer main.
DWELLING UNIT  Any structure, or part thereof, designed and intended
to be occupied as the living quarters of a single family or housekeeping unit,
and having separate kitchen and separate bathroom facilities.
IMPROVED PROPERTY  Any property located within the area served by

notes, loans or other form of indebtedness used to finance or refinance
facilities included in the tapping fee.
OWNER  Any person vested with ownership, legal or equitable, sole or
partial, of any improved property. When more than one person is the owner
of any particular parcel of improved property, all such persons shall be
jointly and severally liable for the payment of the fees and charges imposed
under this article.
PERSON  Any individual, partnership, company, association, society,
corporation, or other group or entity.
SERVICE LINE  A sewer line that directly connects a single building or
structure to a collection facility.
SEWER LATERAL  A collection facility that connects a service line to a
sewer system main.
SEWER SYSTEM  All facilities, as of any particular time, for collecting,
pumping, transporting, treating, or disposing of sewage and other
wastewater, other than stormwater, which are situate in or adjacent to this
Borough and owned, leased or operated by the Borough.
SYSTEM DESIGN CAPACITY  The design capacity of the system for
which the tapping fee is being calculated which represents the total design
capacity of the sewer system.
§ 210-46. Sewer connection fees.
A. Imposition of fee. Except as provided in Subsections C through E and in
§§ 210-49 and 210-50, the owner of each improved property which is to
be newly connected to the sewer system shall pay a connection fee to
the Borough, in the amount in effect under Subsection B as of the time
of payment, at or before the time the owner or his agent obtains a
permit to connect into the sewer system. The connection fee is a charge
for the cost of constructing a sewer lateral from the sewer system main
to the curb or property line fronting the property to be connected, and
connecting the sewer lateral to the sewer system main.
B. Amount of standard connection fee. The standard sewer connection fee
shall be $3,255. [Amended 11-2-2015 by Ord. No. 1319]
C. Construction of facilities by owner.
(1) No sewer connection fee shall be charged to any owner who
constructs the sewer lateral and connects the sewer lateral to the
sewer system main by himself or through his agent at his own
expense. However, in that event, the owner shall pay the Borough
an inspection fee for inspecting the construction of the sewer
lateral and the connection with the sewer system in the amount of
$242. [Amended 11-2-2015 by Ord. No. 1319]
§ 210-45 CATASAUQUA CODE § 210-46
170:362
§ 210-47. Sewer customer facilities fees.
(2) In any case in which the Borough performs some of the labor and/or
provides some of the materials for the sewer lateral construction
and connection, and the owner performs or provides the remainder,
the connection fee shall be equal to the actual cost incurred by the
Borough in connection with the construction of the sewer lateral
and the making of the connection with the sewer system (including
actual inspection costs), the amount of the connection fee
notwithstanding.
(3) No owner shall have the right to construct and connect a sewer
lateral to the sewer system without the approval of the Borough,
which approval may be withheld for any reason or no reason. If the
Borough agrees to permit an owner or his agents to construct a
sewer lateral or make a sewer lateral connection, it may impose
any conditions it desires in connection with the approval, and may
require the payment of the Borough's review, inspection,
administrative, legal, engineering, and other costs, and an advance
deposit or other security to insure such payment.
D. Exception connections. In any case in which the Borough constructs the
sewer lateral and/or makes the connection with the sewer system, and
in which the length of the sewer lateral exceeds 40 feet or the diameter
of the sewer lateral exceeds six inches, the connection fee shall be
equal to the actual cost incurred by the Borough in connection with the
construction of the sewer lateral and the making of the connection with
the sewer system main (including inspection costs).
E. Actual costs. In determining the actual costs incurred by the Borough
under Subsection C or D above, all materials used shall be billed at
their cost to the Borough, time expended by Borough employees shall
be billed at their hourly cost to the Borough (including benefits), time
expended by Borough agents other than employees shall be billed at
their cost to the Borough (to the extent that they are reasonable and do
not exceed normal charge when fees are not reimbursed by property
owners), and other Borough expenses (including administration,
overhead, and use of equipment) shall be billed at their cost to the
Borough, as reasonably estimated by the Borough. Before any work is
begun by the Borough, the owner shall pay the Borough's reasonable
estimate of the connection fee due; after the work is completed, the
Borough shall refund any excess or charge any shortage of the
estimated connection fee as compared to the actual connection fee for
the work.
F. (Reserved)
A. In general.
(1) All customer facilities to connect the structure served on an
improved property with the sewer system at the termination of the
§ 210-46 JUNKYARDS § 210-47

§ 210-48. Tapping fees.
sewer lateral shall be constructed by the owner or his agents. The
construction shall be in accordance with the Borough's regulations,
requirements, rules, and standards, shall be performed by a
contractor acceptable to the Borough, and shall be subject to
inspection by the Borough. Prior to construction, the owner must
deposit with the Borough the Borough's estimated reasonable and
necessary costs of review, inspection, administrative, legal,
engineering, and other services in connection with the work.
Inspection fees under the preceding sentence shall be in addition
to any inspection fees otherwise imposed in relation to the
construction of structures on the improved property or under
§ 210-46, Sewer connection fees. After the completion of the
construction, the Borough may retain all costs actually incurred,
and charge any additional amount of costs in excess of the amount
deposited. However, the Borough shall make no charge for the
purchase or installation of a water meter used for measuring a
user's sewage discharge; such a charge may only be imposed by
the Borough in relation to the connection of an improved property
to the Borough's water system.
(2) The owner shall pay the Borough an inspection fee in the amount of
$242 for inspecting the construction and connection of the service
line from the building or structure to the curb or property line
fronting the property to be connected to sewer lateral. [Amended
11-2-2015 by Ord. No. 1319]
B. Actual costs. In determining the actual costs incurred by the Borough
under Subsection A, all materials used shall be billed at their cost to the
Borough, time expended by Borough employees shall be billed at their
hourly cost to the Borough (including benefits), time expended by
Borough agents other than employees shall be billed at their cost to the
Borough (to the extent that they are reasonable and do not exceed
normal charges when fees are not reimbursed by property owners), and
other Borough expenses (including administration, overhead, and use
of equipment) shall be billed at their cost to the Borough, as reasonably
estimated by the Borough.
C. (Reserved)
A. Initial connection.
(1) New connection. Except as provided in §§ 210-49 and 210-50, the
owner of each improved property which is to be newly connected to
the sewer system shall pay a tapping fee to the Borough, in the
amount specified under Subsection D as of the earlier of the time of
connection or the time the owner or his agent obtains a permit to
connect into the sewer system.

is improperly connected to the sewer system without a permit shall
pay a tapping fee to the Borough, in the amount specified under
Subsection D as of the time of actual payment, immediately upon
demand by the Borough.
(3) Failure to make required connection. The owner of each improved
property, which is not connected to the sewer system within 120
calendar days after the date the Borough serves a notice to connect
such improved property to the sewer system, shall pay a tapping
fee to the Borough, in the amount specified under Subsection D as
of the time of actual payment, on the 121st calendar day after the
date the notice was served. Service for this purpose shall be
complete when a notice to connect is deposited, postage prepaid, in
the United State mail, addressed to the legal owners(s) of the
improved property at their last known address according to the
records of the Lehigh County real estate tax office.
(4) Amount of sewage flow.
(a) For residential use, the amount of sewage flow for an improved
property which is being assessed a tapping fee under this
Subsection A shall be equal to the design capacity required by
a new residential customer for the improved property as of the
later of the date of payment, the date the use intended for the
improved property is established, or the date the
improvements contemplated for the improved property are
completed.
(b) For nonresidential use, the amount of sewage flow for an
improved property which is being assessed a tapping fee under
this Subsection A shall be equal to the daily anticipated amount
of peak flow, as if full building utilization is being realized, for
the proposed nonresidential use for the improved property as
of the later of the date of payment, the date the use intended
for the improved property is established, or the date the
improvements contemplated for the improved property are
completed.
(c) The Borough shall have the option of estimating the amount of
sewage flow using flow calculations available from the
Department of Environmental Protection, from public utility
industry publications, or from user estimates, so long as the
latter has an empirical and readily verifiable basis, provided
that no estimate shall be made in a manner which conflicts
with Acts 2003-57 or 1990-203.
(5) Purpose. The sewer tapping fee is imposed for the ability to use
sewer system facilities to the extent of the sewage flow associated
with the use of the improved property.
B. Increase in potential usage.
§ 210-48 JUNKYARDS § 210-48
170:365
(1) Imposition of fee. The owner of each improved property which is
connected to the sewer system shall pay a tapping fee to the
Borough, in the amount specified under Subsection D as of the time
of payment, whenever the use of the improved property is to be
changed, the use of the improved property is to be intensified, or
improvements, alterations, extensions, or modifications are to be
constructed or made on the improved property unless the amount
of additional sewage flow for the improved property as of the date
the new use intended for the improved property is established, the
date the existing use of the improved property is intensified, or the
date the improvements, alterations, extensions, or modifications
contemplated for the improved property are completed, is less than
or equal to the amount of sewage flow assigned to the improved
property at the time the most recent sewer tapping fee was paid.
(2) Time of payment. The sewer tapping fee described in Subsection
B(1) shall be paid:
(a) At or before the time the owner or his agent obtains a building
permit, if a building permit is required in connection with the
circumstances under which the tapping fee is imposed;

General Provisions
§ 225-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Catasauqua Creek
Watershed Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 225-2. Statement of findings.
The Council of the Borough of Catasauqua finds that:
§ 225-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
welfare within the Catasauqua Creek Watershed by minimizing the damages
and maximizing the benefits described in § 225-2 of this chapter by
provisions designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, changes the
natural hydrologic patterns, destroys aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic
pollutant concentrations and loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity
of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain
management and flood control efforts in downstream communities,
reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to
the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the people of
the Borough and all of the people of the Commonwealth, their resources
and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
F. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth by the
Borough.

A. Impervious cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those defined
in § 225-5B(5) and (6), which would create 10,000 square feet or less of
additional impervious cover is exempt from the drainage plan
preparation provisions of this chapter. All of the impervious cover
added incrementally to a site above the initial 10,000 square feet shall
be subject to the drainage plan preparation provisions of this chapter. If
a site has previously received an exemption and is proposing additional
development such that the total impervious cover on the site exceeds
10,000 square feet, the total impervious cover on the site proposed

Catasauqua Creek Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance,
October 4, 2004, shall be the starting point from which to consider
tracts as "parent tracts" in which future subdivisions and
respective impervious area computations shall be cumulatively
considered.
(2) For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with these criteria.
(3) Additional impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to,
additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages, driveways,
storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or driveway
areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or
for the proposed regulated activity.
(4) Any additional areas proposed to initially be gravel, crushed stone,
porous pavement, etc., shall be assumed to be impervious for the
purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria. Any existing

shall implement such measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent
Borough prior to the effective date of this chapter is exempt from the
drainage plan preparation provisions of this chapter, except as cited
in Subsection C, provided that the approved drainage plan included
design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site currently
proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance provisions
in effect at the time of approval and the approval has not lapsed under
the Municipalities Planning Code. If significant revisions are made to
the drainage plan after both the preliminary plan approval and the
effective date of this chapter, preparation of a new drainage plan,
subject to the provisions of this chapter, shall be required. Significant
revisions would include a change in control methods or techniques,
relocation or redesign of control measures or changes necessary
because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the original
drainage plan.
C. These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing
such measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, property, and
state water quality requirements. These measures include adequate
and safe conveyance of stormwater on the site and as it leaves the site.
These exemptions do not relieve the applicant from the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
D. No exemptions shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in

These criteria may vary by community context as well as by type of
development being proposed. Additionally, MD/MM also shall include
provisions (e.g., deed restrictions, conservation easements) to protect
these areas from future disturbance and from application of fertilizers,
pesticides, and herbicides.
NO-HARM OPTION  The option of using a less restrictive runoff
quantity control if it can be shown that adequate and safe runoff

an inflow hydrograph through a reservoir or detention structure. The
method solves the mass conservation equation to determine an outflow
hydrograph as it leaves the storage facility.
STORM DRAINAGE PROBLEM AREAS  Areas which lack adequate
stormwater collection and/or conveyance facilities and which present a
hazard to persons or property. These areas are either documented in

maintenance and clean out.
Each stream segment in Pennsylvania has a designated use, such
as cold-water fishes or potable water supply, which is listed in
Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained under
state regulations.
(1)
Existing uses are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
(2)
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants, such as sediment, and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to
protect the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the
waterway to prevent these impacts.

one-hundred-year floodplain is defined by the Borough, there shall be
provided drainage easements conforming substantially with the line of
such watercourses. The width of any easement shall be adequate to
provide for unobstructed flow of storm runoff based on calculations
made in conformance with § 225-18 for the one-hundred-year return
period runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of 0.5 foot above the
design water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper
runoff conveyance shall be required. Watercourses for which the onehundred-
year floodplain is formally defined are subject to the applicable
municipal floodplain regulations.
F. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage swales on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage,
open channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line
and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels
shall be calculated using the Manning Equation.

§ 225-13. Permit requirements by other government entities.
The following permit requirements apply to certain regulated and earth
disturbance activities and must be met prior to commencement of regulated
and earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
G. Postconstruction BMPs shall be designed, installed, operated and
maintained to meet the requirements of the Clean Streams Law98 and
implementing regulations, including the established practices in 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 102 and the specifications of this chapter as to prevent
accelerated erosion in watercourse channels and at all points of
discharge.
H. No earth disturbance activities associated with any regulated activities
shall commence until approval by the Borough of a plan which

§ 225-14. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth
disturbance activities.
§ 225-15. Postconstruction water quality criteria.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities. Written approval by DEP or a
delegated County Conservation District shall satisfy this requirement.
B. An erosion and sediment control plan is required by DEP regulations for
any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under Pa.
Code § 102.4(b).
C. A DEP NPDES Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction
Activities Permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities
under Pa. Code Chapter 92.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the Borough before the
commencement of an earth disturbance activity.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough of a drainage plan which
demonstrates compliance with this chapter. This chapter provides
standards to meet NPDES permit requirements associated with
construction activities and MS4 permit requirements.
B. The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The
WQv shall be calculated two ways.
(1) First, WQv shall be calculated using the following formula:
WQv = (c)(P)(A)/12
Where
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
c = Rational Method postdevelopment runoff coefficient
for the two-year storm
P = 1.25 inches
A = Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
(2) Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff
volume from predevelopment to postdevelopment for the two-yearreturn-
period storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site
shall be considered in this calculation. The larger of these two
calculated volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and
§ 225-14 JUNKYARDS § 225-15
170:427
treated, except that in no case shall the WQv be permitted to
exceed 1.25 inches of runoff over the site area. This standard does
not limit the volume of infiltration an applicant may propose for
purposes of water quantity/peak rate control.
C. The WQv shall be calculated for each postdevelopment drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious
cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
D. If an applicant is proposing to use a dry extended detention basin, wet
pond, constructed wetland or other BMP that ponds water on the land
surface and may receive direct sunlight, the discharge from that BMP
must be treated by infiltration, a vegetated buffer, filter strip,
bioretention, vegetated swale or other BMP that provides a thermal
benefit to protect the high-quality waters of the Catasauqua Creek from
thermal impacts.
E. The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either be
treated with infiltration or two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in
Subsection O, except for minor areas on the periphery of the site that
cannot reasonably be drained to an infiltration facility or other BMP.
F. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill unless the applicant
demonstrates that the fill is stable and otherwise meets the infiltration
BMP standards of this chapter.
G. The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate
and noncarbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site
evaluations by a qualified geotechnical professional.
H. For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed where an
applicant intends to use infiltration BMPs, the applicant shall conduct a
preliminary site investigation, including gathering data from published
sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a
minimum of two percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G.101 This
investigation will determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal
high-water table, soil permeability and location of special geologic
features, if applicable. This investigation may be done by a certified
sewage enforcement officer (SEO) except that the location(s) of special
geologic features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical
professional.
I. Sites where applicants intend to use infiltration BMPs must meet the
following criteria:
(1) Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP is greater than or
equal to two feet.
101. Editor's Note: Appendix G is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 225-15 CATASAUQUA CODE § 225-15
170:428
(2) Depth to seasonal high-water table below the invert of the BMP is
greater than or equal to three feet; except for infiltration of
residential roof runoff where the seasonal high-water table must be
below the invert of the BMP. (If the depth to bedrock is between
two feet and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high-water
table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the depth
to seasonal high-water table is required.)
(3) Soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 PA Code § 73.15
percolation test in Appendix G102) is greater than or equal to 0.5
inch/hour and less than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
(4) Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(a) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(b) Fifteen feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations; except for residential development where the
required setback is 15 feet downgradient or 40 feet upgradient
from building foundations.
(c) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields; except for residential
development where the required setback is 25 feet from septic
system drainfields.
(d) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock
unless a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(e) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from existing or potential
future wells, foundations and drainfields on neighboring
properties will be met; except for one- and two-family
residential dwellings, where the required setback is 40 feet
unless documentation is provided to show that all setbacks
from existing or potential future wells, foundations and
drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
J. For entirely noncarbonate sites, the recharge volume (REv) shall be
infiltrated unless the applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to
infiltrate the REv for reasons of seasonal high-water table, permeability
rate, soil depth or setback distances; or except as provided in
Subsection U.
(1) The REv shall be calculated as follows:
REv = (0.25) * (I)/12
Where:
REv = Recharge volume in acre-feet
102. Editor's Note: Appendix G is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 225-15 JUNKYARDS § 225-15
170:429
I = impervious area in acres
(2) The preliminary site investigation described in Subsection H is
required and shall continue on different areas of the site until a
potentially suitable infiltration location is found or the entire site is
determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For infiltration areas
that appear to be feasible based on the preliminary site
investigation the additional site investigation and testing as
outlined in Appendix G103 shall be completed.
(3) If an applicant proposes infiltration, the Borough may determine
infiltration to be infeasible if there are known existing conditions or
problems that may be worsened by the use of infiltration.
(4) The site must meet the conditions listed in Subsection I.
(5) If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full REv, the applicant shall
infiltrate that portion of the REv that is feasible based on the site
characteristics. If none of the REv can be infiltrated, REv shall be
considered as part of the WQv and shall be captured and treated as
described in Subsection O.
(6) If REv is infiltrated, it may be subtracted from the WQv required to
be captured and treated.
K. In entirely carbonate areas, where the applicant intends to use
infiltration BMPs, the preliminary site investigation described in
Subsection H shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that appear
feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the applicant shall
conduct the additional site investigation and testing as outlined in
Appendix G.104 The soil depth, percolation rate and proposed loading
rate, each weighted as described in § 225-18, along with the buffer from
special geologic features shall be compared to the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D105 to determine if the site is recommended for
infiltration. In addition to the recommendation from Appendix D, the
conditions listed in Subsection I are required for infiltration in
carbonate areas. Applicants are encouraged to infiltrate the REv, as
calculated in Subsection J, but are not required to use infiltration BMPs
on a carbonate site even if the site falls in the recommended range on
the chart in Appendix D. Any amount of volume infiltrated can be
subtracted from the WQv to be treated by noninfiltration BMPs. If
infiltration is not proposed, the full WQv shall be treated by two
acceptable BMPs, as specified in Subsection O.
L. If a site has both carbonate and noncarbonate areas, the applicant shall
investigate the ability of the noncarbonate portion of the site to fully
103. Editor's Note: Appendix G is included at the end of this chapter.

§ 225-15 CATASAUQUA CODE § 225-15
170:430
meet this chapter to meet the requirements for REv for the whole
site through infiltration. If that proves infeasible, infiltration in the
carbonate area as described in Subsection K or two other
noninfiltration BMPs as described in Subsection O must be used. No
infiltration structure in the noncarbonate area shall be located within
50 feet of a boundary with carbonate bedrock, except when a
preliminary site investigation has been done showing the absence of
special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration
area.
M. If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the
postdevelopment two-year runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80%
or more of the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate portion
of the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the
predevelopment infiltration volume.
N. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance
and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
O. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each
discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be
considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and
concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an
impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one BMP, the
length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length
of impervious area. In no case may the same BMP be employed
consecutively to meet the requirement of this section. Acceptable BMPs
are listed below along with the recommended reference for design:

Q. The use of infiltration BMPs is prohibited on hot spot land use areas.
R. Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be placed in or on a special
geologic feature(s). Additionally, stormwater runoff shall not be
discharged into existing on-site sinkholes.
S. Applicants shall request, in writing, public water suppliers to provide
the Zone I wellhead protection radius, as calculated by the method
outlined in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Wellhead Protection Regulations, for any public water supply well
within 400 feet of the site. In addition to the setback distances specified
in Subsection I, infiltration is prohibited in the Zone I radius as defined
and substantiated by the public water supplier in writing. If the
applicant does not receive a response from the public water supplier,
the Zone I radius is assumed to be 100 feet.

by controlling the two-year-postdevelopment runoff to a thirty-percent
release rate.
U. The Borough may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than
those in this section, provided that they meet the minimum
requirements of and do not conflict with state law including but not
limited to the Clean Streams Law.106
A. Mapping of stormwater management districts. To implement the
provisions of the Catasauqua Creek Watershed Stormwater
Management Plan, the Borough is hereby divided into stormwater
management districts consistent with the Catasauqua Creek Release
Rate Map presented in the plan update. The boundaries of the
stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is
available for inspection at the Borough office. A copy of the official map
at a reduced scale is included in Appendix A for general reference.107
B. Description of stormwater management districts. Two types of
stormwater management districts may be applicable to the Borough,
namely Conditional/Provisional No Detention Districts and Dual
Release Rate Districts as described below.
(1) Conditional/provisional no detention districts. Within these
districts, the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities (as
defined in Article II) must be calculated to determine if adequate
capacity exists. For this determination, the developer must
calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as
proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the
existing condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows
assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current
zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls
specified by this chapter. The larger of the two peak flows
calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists.
If adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site
to the main channel (as defined in Article II), these watershed areas
may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention
facilities. If the capacity calculations show that the local runoff
conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity, the developer shall
either use a one-hundred-percent release rate control or provide
increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased
peak flows consistent with § 225-17P. Any capacity improvements
must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas
tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria
specified in § 225-17D. By definition, a storm drainage problem

§ 225-17. Stormwater management district implementation
provisions.
area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates
that adequate capacity does not exist. Sites in these districts are
still required to meet all of the water quality requirements in
§ 225-15.
(2) Dual release rate districts. Within these districts, the two-year
postdevelopment peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the
predevelopment two-year runoff peak. Further, the ten-year,
twenty-five-year, and one-hundred-year postdevelopment peak
runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the
predevelopment peak. Release rates associated with the ten-year
through one-hundred-year events vary from 50% to 100%
depending upon location in the watershed. (For the Monocacy
Creek and Nancy Run Watersheds, the original single release rate
districts become dual release rate districts due to the channel
protection standard requiring developments to meet a two-yearthirty-
percent release rate.)
A. Applicants shall provide a comparative preconstruction and
postconstruction stormwater management hydrograph analysis for
each direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
B. Any stormwater management controls required by this chapter and
subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release
rate criteria for each of the two-, ten-, twenty-five-, and one-hundredyear-
return-period runoff events consistent with the calculation
methodology specified in § 225-18.
C. The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours
provided as part of the drainage plan. The district boundaries as
originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or, in certain
instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a
physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical
feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea
boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
D. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
chapter shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year-return-period event
§ 225-16 JUNKYARDS § 225-17
170:437
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year-return-period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year-return-period
runoff.
E. For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
applicable release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge, individual drainage directions may be
designed for up to a one-hundred-percent release rate so long as the
total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
F. For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be
the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a one-hundred-percent release rate
provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average
release rate.
G. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a conditional/provisional no
detention subarea, the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a
site may not be changed post-development to create potentially adverse
conditions on downstream properties except as part of a no harm or
hardship waiver procedure.
H. No portion of a site may be regraded between the Catasauqua Creek
Watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no harm or
hardship waiver procedure.
I. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design
release from the site will be the lesser of (a) the applicable release rate
flow assuming no closed depression(s), or (b) the existing peak flow
actually leaving the site. In cases where (b) would result in an
unreasonably small design release, the design discharge of less than or
equal to the release rate will be determined by the available
downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using
Subsection D and the minimum orifice criteria.
§ 225-17 CATASAUQUA CODE § 225-17
170:438
J. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site using the capacity
criteria in Subsection D and the detention criteria in § 225-18.
K. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied
to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All
site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of
whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that
time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series
where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
L. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact
area shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area
includes any proposed cover or grading changes.
M. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged
from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the
release rate provisions of this chapter.
N. No harm water quantity option.
(1) For any proposed development site not located in a conditional
provisional no detention district, the developer has the option of
using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the
developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the
proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by
discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan.
Special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic
aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the
development of the plan runoff control strategy. Proof of no harm
would have to be shown from the development site through the
remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence
of the creek with the Delaware or Lehigh River. Proof of no harm
must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in Subsection D
if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm
justification.
(2) Attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow
versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following
provisions:
(a) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five-, and onehundred-
year) shall be the values from the calibrated PSRM
Model for the Catasauqua Creek or as calculated by an
applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the
§ 225-17 JUNKYARDS § 225-17
170:439
Borough. The flow values from the PSRM Model would be
supplied to the developer by the Borough upon request.
(b) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system
as documented by a developer may be used by the developer
only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to
the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified
capacity (i.e., if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped
acreage, he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).
(c) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas
would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to
prove no harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity
improvements for the problem areas consistent with
Subsection P.
(3) Any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Article IV. Developers
submitting no harm justifications must still meet all of the water
quality requirements in § 225-15.
O. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required
release rate at the point of discharge.
P. Capacity improvements.
(1) In certain instances, primarily within the conditional/provisional no
detention areas, local drainage conditions may dictate more
stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection
of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the developer could
prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to
relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then
the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in
lieu of runoff controls on the development site. Peak flow
calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in
the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed
is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff
controls. Any capacity improvements would be designed using the
larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in
Subsection D. All new development in the entire subarea(s) within
which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to
implement the developer's proposed discharge control, if any.
§ 225-17 CATASAUQUA CODE § 225-17
170:440
§ 225-18. Calculation methodology.
(2) Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a
modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity
improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control
would not create any harm downstream.
A. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the rational method or the soil-cover-complex methodology.
B. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D108 shall be calculated as follows:
(Area tributary to infiltration BMP/Base area of infiltration BMP)*100%
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as follows:
All disturbed areas to be made impervious: weight at 100%
All disturbed areas to be made pervious: weight at 50%
All undisturbed pervious areas: weight at 0%
All existing impervious areas: weight at 100%
C. Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system.
(1) The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation Chart for
Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock
in Appendix D109 is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the
thickness factor based on soil permeability (as measured by the
adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G110, as
follows:
Permeability Range*
(inches/hour) Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 1.0

110. Editor's Note: Appendix G is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 225-17 JUNKYARDS § 225-18
170:441
NOTES:
* If the permeability rate (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code
§ 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G) falls on a break between
two thickness factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
(2) Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 inches/hour or less
than 0.5 inch/hour, as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15
percolation test in Appendix G, are not recommended for
infiltration.
D. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this chapter shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through the proposed basin using the storage indication method or
other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the Rational Method technique, the design hydrograph
for routing shall be either the Universal Rational hydrograph or the
Modified Rational Method trapezoidal hydrograph which maximizes
detention volume. Use of the Modified Rational hydrograph shall be
consistent with the procedure described in Section "PIPE.RAT" of the
Users' Manual for the Penn State Urban Hydrology Model (1987).
E. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
F. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below
the lowest outlet invert.
G. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv
shall assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet
is full at the beginning of design event routing for the purposes of
evaluating peak outflows.
H. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum 1.0 foot
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with the twoyear
through twenty-five-year runoff events. A 0.5 foot freeboard shall
be provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-year
runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool
elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The two-year through
one-hundred-year storm events shall be controlled by the primary
outlet structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be
designed to pass the one-hundred-year-return-frequency-storm-peakbasin-
inflow rate with a minimum 0.5 foot freeboard measured to the
top of basin. The freeboard criteria shall be met considering any off-site
areas tributary to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this
detention facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the
design of the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105
regulations, and may be required to pass a storm greater than the onehundred-
year event.
§ 225-18 CATASAUQUA CODE § 225-18
170:442
I. The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lessersize
orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be
acceptable with a three-inch orifice provided that as much of the site
runoff as practical is directed to the detention facilities. The minimum
three-inch diameter does not apply to the control of the WQv.
J. Runoff calculations using the soil-cover-complex method shall use the
Natural Resources Conservation Service Type II twenty-four-hour
rainfall distribution. The twenty-four-hour rainfall depths for the
various return periods to be used consistent with this chapter may be
taken from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 Version 2.1, 2004 or the PennDOT
Intensity/Duration/Frequency Field Manual (PDT-IDF) (May 1986) for
Region 4.
(1) The following values are taken from the PDT-IDF Field Manual:
Return Period
24-Hour Rainfall Depth

5-year 3.60
10-year 4.56
25-year 5.52
50-year 6.48
100-year 7.44
(2) A graphical and tabular presentation of the Type II twenty-fourhour
distribution is included in Appendix C.111
K. Runoff calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and
return periods and NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 Version 2.1, 2004 or the
Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves as presented in Appendix C.112
L. Runoff curve numbers (CN's) to be used in the soil-cover-complex
method shall be based upon the matrix presented in Appendix C.113
M. Runoff coefficients for use in the Rational Method shall be based upon
the table presented in Appendix C.114
N. All time of concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach
which may include one or all of the flow types below:

§ 225-18 JUNKYARDS § 225-18
170:443
(1) Sheet flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or
the modified kinematic wave travel time equation (equation 3-3,
NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If using the modified kinematic wave
travel time equation, the sheet flow length shall be limited to 50
feet for designs using the Rational Method and limited to 150 feet
for designs using the soil-cover-complex method.
(2) Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from
the watercourse slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure
3-1 of TR-55, June 1986.
(3) Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated by the Manning Equation. Bankfull flows shall be used
for determining velocities. Manning 'n' values shall be based on the
table presented in Appendix C.115
(4) Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning Equation assuming full flow and the
Manning 'n' values from Appendix C.116
O. If using the Rational Method, all predevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
If using the Rational Method, all postdevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
P. The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning 'n' values used in the calculations shall be
consistent with the table presented in Appendix C117 or other
appropriate standard engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe capacities
shall be determined by methods acceptable to the Borough.
Q. The Pennsylvania DEP, Chapter 105, Rules and Regulations, apply to
the construction, modification, operation or maintenance of both
existing and proposed dams, water obstructions and encroachments
throughout the watershed. Criteria for design and construction of
stormwater management facilities according to this chapter may differ
from the criteria that are used in the permitting of dams under the Dam
Safety Program.

copy of the waiver request shall be provided to each of the following:
Borough, Borough Engineer, Borough solicitor and Lehigh Valley
Planning Commission. The request shall fully document the nature of
the alleged hardship.
B. The Borough may grant a waiver provided that all of the following
findings are made in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the stormwater
management district in which the property is located;
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, including the no
harm provisions, and that the authorization of a waiver is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
(4) That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum waiver
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue; and
(5) That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a hardship
waiver.
C. In granting any waiver, the Borough may attach such conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
chapter. If a hardship waiver is granted, the applicant must still manage
§ 225-24 JUNKYARDS § 225-25

owned and in which streets, sewers and other public improvements
are to be dedicated to the Borough, stormwater BMPs may also be
dedicated to and maintained by the Borough;
(2) If a plan includes operations and maintenance by a single owner or
if sewers and other public improvements are to be privately owned
and maintained, then the operation and maintenance of stormwater
BMPs shall be the responsibility of the owner or private
management entity.
B. The Borough shall make the final determination on the continuing
operations and maintenance responsibilities. The Borough reserves the
right to accept or reject the operations and maintenance responsibility
for any or all of the stormwater BMPs.

leading to final plan recording and the preparation of any
agreements required by the Borough) or paid or incurred by the
Borough and arising out of or relating to the construction,
observation, inspection, review and/or approval of the public
improvements or the common amenities contemplated by the
developer's preliminary or final plan.
(2) The rate(s) at which review fees are charged shall be approved by
resolution enacted or motion made and approved at a duly
advertised public meeting of the Borough Council. For the purpose

amenities contemplated by the developer's preliminary or final plan.
D. No construction of public improvements or common amenities
contemplated by a preliminary plan shall commence and no recording
of a final plan shall occur until all consultant review fees paid or
incurred by the Borough are paid by the developer in accordance with

Borough the full amount of the consultant review fees then due and
owing without deducting the sum in dispute.
H. Where established by resolution or an improvements agreement, the
developer shall at all times properly fund an escrow account. Any
failure of the Borough to notify the developer of a deficiency in an
escrow account and/or any failure to demand escrow account
replenishment shall not constitute a defense to, or waiver of, any claim
by the Borough to be reimbursed for consultant review fees paid or
incurred by the Borough in connection with the review and approval of
the developer's plan or the construction, observation, inspection,
review and approval of the public improvements and common amenities
contemplated by the developer's preliminary or final plan. At all times,
the Borough shall, at its sole discretion, have the right to bill a
developer directly for review fees paid or incurred.
I. A failure by the developer to timely replenish an escrow account or to
pay the Borough's bill for consultant review fees may, in the sole
discretion of the Borough, result in the imposition of any or all of the
preventive remedies found at Section 515.1 of the Municipalities
Planning Code, as amended,130 and/or the issuance of a stop-work
order. In addition to these remedies, the Borough shall retain the right
to initiate and prosecute actions at law or in equity to obtain payment
and/or reimbursement of consultant review fees. In the event that the
Borough shall initiate suit to recover consultant review fees, the
Borough shall be entitled to claim and recover all costs, witness fees,
expert witness fees and reasonable attorney fees relating to the
prosecution of the claim.

relating to one or more projects involving the development or proposed
development of the same property or any part thereof, the Borough
may, at its sole discretion and with notice to the developer, combine
escrow accounts by transferring existing balances into one account.

relating to one or more projects involving the development or proposed
development of the same property or any part thereof, and where there

may, at its sole discretion, transfer and combine any such balances in
one account and/or withdraw sums from any existing accounts to
reduce a deficiency or to pay for review fees incurred, provided that
written notice is provided thereof to the developer.

in all proposed plans:
A. Conformance with other requirements.
(1) All subdivisions and land developments shall comply fully with all
federal, state, county, Borough and other applicable laws and
regulations. Evidence of the receipt of any permits or approvals
required by such laws and regulations shall be submitted by the
subdivider and shall be a condition of the approval of any plan
submitted under this chapter.
(2) Where such other laws and regulations are more restrictive than
those contained herein, such other regulations shall be observed.
B. General design standards and comprehensive plan requirements.
(1) Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be subdivided.
Land which is unsafe or unsuited for development due to flooding,
subsidence, underground fires, open quarries, unconsolidated fill,
steep slopes or other hazardous conditions shall not be subdivided
unless proper safeguards are provided and approved by the
Commission.
(2) Consideration shall be given in the design of all land developments
and subdivisions to the future development needs of the Borough
and the objectives established in any officially prepared Borough or
regional comprehensive or master plan for land use, streets and
thoroughfares, public utilities and facilities and to other
governmental plans affecting the subdivision and land
development.
(3) In reviewing subdivision plans, the Commission will consider the
adequacy of existing or proposed community facilities to serve the
additional dwellings proposed by the subdivision.
(4) Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use
shown in the Comprehensive Plan is located in whole or in part in a
subdivision, the Commission may require the reservation of such
area as may be deemed reasonable. Where said area is not
dedicated, it shall be reserved for acquisition or initiation of
condemnation proceedings by the Borough for a period of one year,
after which such reservation shall lapse if action to acquire said
property has not been taken by the Borough.
133. Editor's Note: Table 1 is included at the end of this section.
§ 235-13 JUNKYARDS § 235-13
170:501
(5) Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities should be
adequate to provide for building sites, landscaping and off-street
parking as appropriate to the use proposed.
(6) The layout of the proposed subdivision shall be in general
conformity with the features or developments proposed in the
master plan of the Borough.
(7) All plan proposals shall be coordinated with existing and proposed
development on adjoining or adjacent land.
C. Street system layout.
(1) Proposed streets shall be designed to provide safe and efficient
access to all parcels, to create a functional street system including
major streets, collector streets and local streets where appropriate,
and to minimize street intersections and pedestrian-vehicular
conflicts.
(2) Where a subdivision abuts an existing street which has a narrow
width, improper alignment or other deficiency, the Commission
may require the dedication of additional right-of-way to correct the
existing deficiency.
(3) The street system layout shall make adequate provision for any
possible resubdivision or new additional subdivision of the area
being subdivided.
(4) Street dimensions and design standards shall be in accordance
with Table 1.134
(5) The location of all major streets in the proposed subdivision and
land development shall conform in general alignment to the traffic
plan adopted by the Borough Planning Commission.
(6) The proposed street layout shall provide for the continuation or
projection of existing streets in the surrounding area unless the
Commission deems such extension undesirable for specific reasons
of topography or design.
(7) Streets shall be logically related to the topography to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
(8) Minor streets shall be laid out to discourage through traffic, but
provision for street connections into and from adjacent areas will
generally be required.
(9) Proposed streets shall be extended to provide access to adjoining
property where necessary.
134. Editor's Note: Table 1 is included at the end of this section.
§ 235-13 CATASAUQUA CODE § 235-13
170:502
(10) Adequate street rights-of-way shall be provided as necessary where
lots in the proposal are large enough to permit resubdivision, or if a
portion of the tract is not subdivided.
(11) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major traffic street, the Commission may require marginal access
streets, rear service alleys, reverse frontage lots or such other
treatment as will provide protection for abutting properties,
reduction in the number of intersections with the major street, and
separation of local and through traffic.
(a) Where residential reverse frontage lots are utilized, they shall
have a rear yard with a minimum depth of 75 feet to the
ultimate right-of-way of the major street on which they abut
and they shall have a planting screen easement at least 10 feet
wide across which there shall be no right of access.
(12)New half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where
essential to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with
the other requirements and standards contained herein and where,
in addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining
part of the street can be secured.
(13) Wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or
partial street, the other part of the street shall be plotted within
such tract.
(14) Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit
future street extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as
culs-de-sac.
(15)New reserve strips, including those controlling access to streets,
shall be avoided.
D. Street intersections.
(1) Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles. No street shall intersect another at an angle of less than
60°.
(2) Multiple intersections involving junction of more than two streets

§ 235-16. Completion of improvements or guarantee thereof
prerequisite to final plat approval. [Amended 12-6-1976 by Ord. No.
739; 5-3-1982 by Ord. No. 839; 6-5-1995 by Ord. No. 1031]
to the satisfaction of the Borough that the land will support a
legitimate park and recreation use considering, where relevant, the
following factors:
(a) Consistency with the Borough of Catasauqua Recreation, Park
and Open Space Plan, as may be amended from time to time;
(b) Consistency with the Borough's Official Map, as may be
amended from time to time;
(c) Availability for use of the public;
(d) Location entirely within the Borough;
(e) Means for public ingress and egress;
(f) Accessibility of essential utilities and services;
(g) Ability to accommodate adequate vehicle parking facilities;
(h) Suitability of land characteristics for the intended use,
including but not limited to configuration, natural features,
cultural features and man-made features;
(i) Compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood;
(j) Proximity to other community facilities; and
(k) Such other factors that the Borough may deem relevant.
A. No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plat
have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this chapter
and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade
trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
improvements as may be required by this chapter have been installed in
accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat,
including improvements or fees otherwise required by this chapter, the
developer may deposit with the Borough financial security in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common amenities
including basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational
facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings
which may be required.
B. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Borough Council, shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plat or
§ 235-15 JUNKYARDS § 235-16
170:515
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial
improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of
contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the
financial security agreement is not executed within 90 days unless a
written extension is granted by the Borough Council; such extension
shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the
request of the developer.
C. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Borough may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for
the purposes of this section.
D. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the
party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
commonwealth.
E. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public,
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
F. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the developer. Annually, the Borough may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements
which have been completed and the estimated cost for the completion
of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date
of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Borough may require
the developer to post additional security in order to assure that the
financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
G. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Borough, upon the recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the Borough are unable to agree upon an estimate, then
the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Borough and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
§ 235-16 CATASAUQUA CODE § 235-16
170:516
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be
paid equally by the Borough and the applicant or developer.
H. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
I. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Borough Council may authorize submission of final plats by sections or
stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to
improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
J. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough Council to
release or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of
the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing
addressed to the Borough Council, and the Borough Council shall have
45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Borough
Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough Council that such portion
of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance
with the approved plat. Upon such certification the Borough Council
shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of
an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly representing
the value of the improvements completed or, if the Borough Council
fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the Borough Council shall
be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The
Borough Council may, prior to final release at the time of completion
and certification by its engineer, require retention of 10% of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
K. Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Borough Council may
require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of
said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plat for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as
otherwise required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed
15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.

170:517
L. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Borough, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this section.
M. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as
set forth in this section, the Borough shall not condition the issuance of
building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement
of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted
upon the final plat upon actual completion of the improvements
depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said financial
security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or
buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the improvement
of the streets providing access to and from existing public roads to such
building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or beyond
the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the
reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
N. Development agreement. All subdividers proposing any subdivision or
land development requiring the installation of improvements as
required herein shall be required to enter into a legally binding
development agreement with the Borough of Catasauqua guaranteeing

§ 235-18. Remedies to effect completion of improvements. [Added
6-5-1995 by Ord. No. 1031]
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final plat
the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate
bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the
proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered
by said security, the Borough Council may, at its option, install part of
such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development
and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the
moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of
the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any legal or
equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely
for the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not
for any other Borough purpose.
(2) If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the Borough and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Borough shall
jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another professional
engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
review the said expenses and make a determination as to the
amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
(3) The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence
and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his
or her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within
50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay
the entire amount determined in the decision immediately.
(4) In the event that the Borough and applicant cannot agree upon the
professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the billing
date, then, upon application of either party, the President Judge of
the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the
Borough is located (or if at the time there be no President Judge,
then the senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such
engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the Borough Engineer
nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Borough or the applicant within the
preceding five years.
(5) The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in
the decision is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the
Borough shall pay the fee of the professional engineer, but
otherwise the Borough and the applicant shall each pay 1/2 of the
fee of the appointed professional engineer.

or final, is duly filed as provided in this chapter, and while such
application is pending approval or disapproval, no change or
amendment of this chapter, zoning or other governing ordinance or
plan shall affect the decision on such application adversely to the
applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in accordance
with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they stood
at the time the application was duly approved. The applicant shall be
entitled to final approval in accordance with the terms of the approved
preliminary application as hereinafter provided. However, if an
application is properly and finally denied, any subsequent application
shall be subject to the intervening change in governing regulations.
B. When an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or final,
has been approved without conditions or approved by the applicant's
acceptance of conditions, no subsequent change or amendment in this
chapter, zoning or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to
affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence and to complete
any aspect of the approved development in accordance with the terms
of such approval within five years from such approval.
C. Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid
five -year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary
approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary
approval, the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of
this chapter or the governing ordinance or plans as they stood at the
time when the application for such approval was duly filed.
D. Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plat within the aforesaid fiveyear
limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the Borough
Council, no change of any ordinance or plan enacted subsequent to the
date of filing of the preliminary plat shall modify or revoke any aspect of
the approved final plat pertaining to zoning classification or density, lot,
building, street or utility location.
E. In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by
the landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed
sections as well as deadlines within which applications for final plat
approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be
updated annually by the applicant on or before the anniversary of the
preliminary plat approval, until final plat approval of the final section
has been granted and any modification in the aforesaid schedule shall
be subject to approval of the Borough Council in its discretion.
§ 235-19 CATASAUQUA CODE § 235-19
170:522
F. Each section in any residential subdivision or land development, except
for the last section, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the total number
of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser
percentage is approved by the Borough Council in its discretion.
Provided the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any
of the conditions of the preliminary plat approval, including compliance
with landowner's aforesaid schedule of submission of final plats for the
various sections, then the aforesaid protections afforded by
substantially completing the improvements depicted upon the final plat
within five years shall apply and for any section or sections, beyond the
initial section, in which the required improvements have not been
substantially completed within said five-year period the aforesaid
protections shall apply for an additional term or terms of three years
from the date of final plat approval for each section.
G. Failure of landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of submission
of final plats for the various sections shall subject any such section to
any and all changes in this chapter, zoning, and other governing
ordinance enacted by the Borough subsequent to the date of the initial
preliminary plan submission.

§ 235-23. Purpose.
The specific purpose of these special provisions is:
§ 235-24. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This article supersedes any ordinances currently in effect in flood-prone
areas. However, any underlying ordinance shall remain in full force and
effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive.
§ 235-25. Municipal liability.
The grant of a permit or approval of a subdivision and/or land development
plan in the identified flood-prone area(s) shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the Borough or by an
official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the proposed
use, and shall create no liability upon the Borough, its officials or
employees.
§ 235-26. Preapplication procedures.
A. To regulate the subdivision and/or development of flood-prone land
areas in order to promote the general health, welfare and safety of the
community.
B. To require that each subdivision lot in flood-prone areas be provided
with a safe building site with adequate access; and that public facilities
which serve such uses be designed and installed to preclude flood
damage at the time of initial construction.
C. To protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for use
because of flooding by prohibiting the subdivision and/or development
of unprotected flood-prone lands.
A. Prior to the preparation of any plans, it is suggested that prospective
developers consult with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection concerning soil suitability when on-site sewage disposal
facilities are proposed.
B. Prospective developers shall consult the Lehigh County Conservation
District representative concerning erosion and sediment control and
the soil limitations that might exist on the proposed development. At the
same time, a determination should be made as to whether any flood
hazards will be created as a result of the subdivision or development.
§ 235-23 JUNKYARDS § 235-27
170:529
§ 235-27. Preliminary and final plan requirements.
The following information shall be required as part of the preliminary plan
and shall be prepared by a registered engineer or surveyor:
§ 235-28. Design standards and improvements.
A. Name of engineer, surveyor or other qualified person responsible for
providing the information required in this section.
B. A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or land
development with respect to the Borough's flood-prone areas including,
but not limited to, the regulatory flood elevations; boundaries of floodprone
areas, proposed lots and sites, fills, flood or erosion protective
facilities and areas subject to special deed restrictions.
C. Where the subdivision and/or land development lies partially or
completely in the flood-prone areas, or where the subdivision and/or
land development borders on the flood-prone areas, the preliminary
plan map shall include detailed information giving the location and
elevation of proposed roads, public utilities, and building sites. All such
maps shall also show contours at intervals of two or five feet depending
upon the slope of the land and identify accurately the boundaries of the
flood-prone areas.
D. Final plans shall contain all the aforesaid requirements.
A. Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land
located in flood-prone area(s) may be platted for development with the
provision that the developer construct all buildings and structures to
preclude flood damage in accordance with this and any other laws and
ordinances regulating such development.
B. No subdivision and/or land development, or part thereof, shall be
approved if the proposed development and/or improvements will,
individually or collectively, increase the regulatory flood elevation more
than one foot at any point.
C. Building sites for residences or any other type dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any floodway area. Sites for
these uses may be permitted outside the floodway area if the sites or
dwelling units are elevated to a height at least one foot above the
elevation of the regulatory flood. If fill is authorized and used to raise
the elevation of a site, the fill area shall extend out laterally for a
distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the proposed structure.
D. Building sites for structures or buildings other than for residential uses
shall also not be permitted in any floodway area. Also such sites for
structures or buildings outside the floodway shall be protected as
provided for in Subsection B above. However, the Borough Council may

commercial and industrial uses at an elevation less than one foot above
§ 235-27 CATASAUQUA CODE § 235-28
170:530
§ 235-29. Excavation and grading.
Where any earth-moving or grading is proposed, or where any existing
trees, shrubs or other vegetative cover will be removed, the developer shall
consult the Lehigh County Conservation District representative concerning
plans for erosion and sediment control and to also obtain a report on the
soil characteristics of the site so that a determination can be made as
to the type and degree of development the site can accommodate. The
above information shall be submitted to the Catasauqua Borough Planning
Commission and Council as part of the subdivider's application for
subdivision plan approval.
§ 235-30. Drainage facilities.
§ 235-31. Streets.
The finished elevation of proposed streets shall be no more than one foot
below the regulatory flood elevation. The Borough Engineer may require,
when necessary, profiles and elevations of streets to determine compliance
the regulatory flood if the developer otherwise protects the area to that
height or assures that the buildings or structures will be floodproofed
at least up to that height.
E. If the Catasauqua Borough Planning Commission or Council determines
that only a part of a proposed plat can be safely developed, it shall limit
development to that part and shall require that development proceed
consistent with this determination.
F. When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and the
Catasauqua Borough Council determines that additional controls are
required to insure safe development, it may require the developer to
impose appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed
restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and noted on every recorded
plat.
A. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of surface
waters without damage to persons or property. The system shall insure
drainage at all points along streets and provide positive drainage away
from buildings and on-site waste disposal sites.
B. Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Catasauqua Planning
Commission, Council and Borough Engineer.
C. The Borough Engineer may require a primarily underground system to
accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface system to
accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be
consistent with local and regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be
designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent
properties.
§ 235-28 JUNKYARDS § 235-31
170:531
with this requirement. Drainage openings shall be sufficient to discharge
flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
§ 235-32. Sewer facilities.
All sanitary sewer systems located in flood-prone areas, whether public or
private, shall be floodproofed up to a point one foot above the regulatory
flood elevation.
§ 235-33. Water facilities.
All water systems located in flood-prone areas, whether public or private,
shall be floodproofed to a point one foot above the regulatory flood
elevation. If there is an existing public water supply system on or near

violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The

SFRD in the Borough of Catasauqua, as determined by the last federal
census. The rate of flow of sewage from an SFRD is 90 times the same
average number of residents. As of the date of this article, the average
number of residents in an SFRD is 2.45.
B. Nonresidential. The measure of the rate of flow for water and sewer to a
nonresidential dwelling shall be the anticipated flow, as reasonably
§ 237-1 JUNKYARDS § 237-3
170:547
§ 237-4. Presumed flows by use category.
The presumed flow for any given improved property served or to be served
by the Borough shall be determined in accordance with the Calculation
of Presumed Water or Sanitary Sewerage System Flow by Use Category,
marked as Exhibit A,146 attached hereto and made a part hereof as follows:
determined by the Borough, based upon Department of Environmental
Protection data, public utility industry publications, or from user
estimates, so long as the latter has an empirical and readily verifiable
basis, provided that no estimate shall be made in a manner which
conflicts with Acts 2003-57 or 1990-203.
C. Presumptions.
(1) Variations: peak vs. average day. In all types of uses, the rate of
flow of water or sanitary sewage is not constant at all times. The
rate varies from hour to hour, day to day, and season to season
depending on the demands of the use. When one is concerned with
the ability to provide service at times of peak demand, one is only
interested in the rate of flow at times of peak demand; it is
irrelevant what the average rate of flow is when one needs to
design a system that can accommodate peak demands. In other
situations, it may be more appropriate to consider the average rate
of flow over an extended period of time.
(2) Anticipated flow calculations refer to peak demand. From time to
time, the rate of flow of a fluid must be determined for purposes of
insuring and providing capacity in the Borough sewer and water
systems which can accommodate peak demands on those systems.
Therefore, unless clearly indicated otherwise, all references to
anticipated flow for nonresidential properties shall be considered
references to the average flow from or to a given improved
property during the thirty-day period of any year for which the total
flow is the greatest.
D. Anticipated flow. Except as provided in § 237-5, the amount of
anticipated flow at any given time for any given nonresidential
improved property shall be determined in accordance with § 237-4
(rounded to four decimal places), based upon a rebuttable presumption
applicable as a matter of administrative convenience and necessity to
all calculations, that the average flow of water to, or sanitary sewage
from, a given nonresidential improved property may be calculated
utilizing the thirty-day period of any year for which the total flow is the
greatest.
A. Residential. Improved properties upon which residential uses (other
than hotels and motels) are maintained shall be charged in accordance
with § 237-3A hereof. Additional flows shall be presumed and charged
146. Editor's Note: Exhibit A is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 237-3 CATASAUQUA CODE § 237-4
170:548
for any retail, service, or business use which is attached to or part of a
dwelling unit, in accordance with the other subsections of this section.
However, no additional flows shall be presumed or charged for laundry
facilities provided on an improved property solely for the use of fulltime
residents. Mobile home parks shall be treated as having the flows
for one residential dwelling unit for each space available for the siting
of a mobile home.
B. Hotels and motels. Improved properties upon which hotels or motels
are maintained shall be charged in accordance with Exhibit A. If selfservice
laundry facilities or dining or food service areas are also
provided on the improved property, additional flow shall be presumed
and charged as provided in Subsections C and F. No additional flow
shall be presumed for institutional laundry facilities associated with
hotels or motels and which provide services solely for hotel or motel
guests.
C. Restaurants/food service. Improved properties upon which restaurants
and other food services uses are maintained shall be charged as
follows:
(1) Full-service restaurant. If the use is a full-service restaurant (one in
which the utensils will be washed and reused, and patrons will eat
on the premises), fees in accordance with Exhibit A shall be
presumed and charged on the basis of each square foot of gross
floor area in the dining areas of the restaurant (not counting any
cocktail lounge or bar areas). If cocktail lounge or bar areas are
also present, additional flow shall be presumed and charged as
provided in Subsection C(4) below.
(2) Single-service utensil restaurants. If the use is a single-service
utility restaurant (one in which the utensils will not be washed and
re-used, but in which the majority of patrons will eat on the
premises), fees in accordance with Exhibit A shall be presumed and
charged on the basis of each square foot of gross floor area in the
dining areas of the restaurant.
(3) Take-out restaurants and food catering facilities. If the use is a
take-out restaurant or other food services establishment in which
the majority of patrons will not eat on the premises, or a food
catering facility in which food is prepared for consumption at
another location, fees in accordance with Exhibit A shall be
presumed and charged on the basis of each square foot of gross
floor area occupied by the use (other than gross floor area in any
incidental dining area).
(4) Cocktail lounges and bar areas. If the use includes a cocktail
lounge and/or bar, fees in accordance with Exhibit A shall be
presumed and charged on the basis of each square foot of floor
area in the cocktail lounge and bar areas, including the floor area
behind the bar.

170:549
D. Beauty shops/barbershops. Improved properties upon which beauty
shops or barbershops are maintained (except as described in
Subsection A) shall be charged with fees in accordance with Exhibit A
on the basis of each operator chair. Any change in the number of
operator chairs on an improved property shall constitute a change in
use or a modification of the use of the improved property.
E. Movie or live-performance theatres. Improved properties upon which
movie or live-performance theaters are maintained shall be charged
fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the basis of each square foot of
gross floor area in the performance-viewing areas of the improved

e.g., storage, filing, and supply areas, waiting areas, conference areas,
meeting rooms, halls, elevators, washrooms, etc.).
H. Retail stores. Improved properties upon which retail sales uses are
maintained shall be charged fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the

and uses accessory thereto, other than uses described in
Subsection I(2); and
(2) Warehouse and storage. Fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the
basis of each square foot of gross floor area devoted to warehouse
or storage uses (including aisles, etc.); and
(3) Industrial wastes. Fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the basis of
each reconstituted gallon of industrial waste estimated to be
discharged by the industrial use per day (as determined by the
Borough Engineer). For purposes of this Subsection I(3), the
number of reconstituted gallons is equal to the number of actual
gallons to be discharged if the strength of the discharge is equal to
§ 237-4 CATASAUQUA CODE § 237-4
170:550
or less than 300 mg/1 of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 360
mg/1 of suspended solids (SS), and 85 mg/1 of Total Kjeldahl
nitrogen (TKN); if the actual discharge exceeds a strength of 300
mg/1 BOD, 360 mg/1 SS, or 85 mg/1 TKN, the number of
reconstituted gallons is equal to the number of gallons which would
result if pure water were added to the discharge until the average
strength of the discharge-plus-added-water is equal to or less than
300 mg/1 BOD, 360 mg/1 SS, and 85 mg/1 TKN.
J. Schools.
(1) Day schools. Improved properties upon which schools are
maintained (other than boarding schools) shall be charged fees in
accordance with Exhibit A on the basis of each person if the school
includes showers, or fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the basis
of each person if the school does not include showers.
(2) Boarding schools. Improved properties upon which boarding
schools are maintained shall be charged fees in accordance with
Exhibit A on the basis of each square foot of gross floor area in any
residence hall (including bedrooms, washrooms, lounge areas,
halls, etc.), plus fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the basis of
each person for all other areas.
(3) Person. For purposes of this Subsection J only, the number of
persons in a school shall be equal to the maximum number of
students who may attend the school at any one time as established
by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, plus the number of

expected to be assigned to work at the school building in the event
the number of students at the school is equal to the maximum
permitted number of students.
K. Churches. Improved properties upon which churches are maintained

additional uses shall be charged with additional flow as prescribed in
the other subsections of this § 237-4.
L. Hospitals. Improved properties upon which hospitals are maintained
shall be charged with:
(1) In-patients. Fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the basis of each
in-patient bed the hospital is authorized to maintain (Any change in
the number of authorized in-patient beds shall be deemed a change
in use or modification of use of the improved property.); plus
(2) Out-patients. Fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the basis of each
square foot of gross floor area in the hospital, except for in-patient
§ 237-4 JUNKYARDS § 237-4
170:551
rooms (rooms with beds primarily occupied by in-patients) and
rooms primarily devoted to the performance of medical procedures
on persons who are in-patients at the hospital. In addition, if food
service uses are located at the hospital, such uses shall be charged
with additional flow as prescribed in Subsection C, and the area
occupied by such uses shall not be included in the calculations
made under the first sentence of this Subsection L(2).
M. Institutions other than hospitals. Improved properties upon which
institutions (other than hospitals) are maintained (e.g., nursing homes)
shall be charged fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the basis of each
bed the institution is authorized to maintain. (Any change in the number
of authorized beds shall be deemed a change in use or modification of
use of the improved property for purposes of calculating additional
flow.)
N. Swimming pools and bathhouses.
(1) Except as provided in Subsection N(2), improved properties upon
which swimming pools or bathhouses are maintained shall be
charged fees in accordance with Exhibit A on the basis of each
square foot of gross area in the building areas and/or outdoor
enclosed areas devoted to the pool or bathhouse uses. In addition,
any food service uses shall be charged with additional presumed
flow as provided in Subsection C.
(2) Subsection N(1) shall not apply to pools or bathhouses which are
associated with residential properties and which may only be used
by residents or guests of residents who are not charged an
admission fee.
O. Other uses. Whenever any use exists on an improved property which is
not fairly described in the preceding subsections of this § 237-4, the
amount of additional flow with respect to such use shall be determined,
whenever practicable, by reference to that use (or those uses)
described in the preceding subsections of this § 237-4 which is most
similar to the use which exists on the improved property. Similar uses
for this purpose shall be based on similar patterns of water
consumption and sanitary sewage discharge. Whenever it is not
practicable to calculate additional or presumed flow by reference to one
or more of the preceding provisions of this § 237-4, the Borough
Engineer shall establish the presumed flow for such use in accordance
with the criteria in § 237-3.
P. Multiple uses. Whenever any improved property shall have more than
one use established thereon, the additional presumed flow for such
improved property shall be equal to the sum of the amount of additional
presumed flow for each individual use (as provided in the preceding
subsections of this § 237-4).
§ 237-4 CATASAUQUA CODE § 237-5
170:552
§ 237-5. Special exceptions to use of presumed flows by use
category.
A. In general. The Borough recognizes that the presumption set forth in
§ 237-4 may not properly reflect peak flow rates from a given improved
property for either water, sanitary sewage, or both. Therefore, the
procedures set forth in this section shall apply to any request to
establish a different presumed or anticipated flow for any given
improved property, applicable to either water, sanitary sewage, or both,
by special exception.
B. Request for special exception. Either the Borough or a person with an
interest in the improved property may request a special exception to
the presumptions of § 237-4. The Borough shall make such a request by
mailing (certified mail, return receipt requested to last known address)
or hand-delivering a notice of the request to the owner of the improved
property or his authorized agent. Any other interested person shall
make such a request by filing a written notice with the Borough, on
forms prescribed by the Borough.
C. Agreement of owner and Borough Council. If the owner of the improved
property and the Borough Council shall agree that the presumed or
anticipated flow which should be assigned to any improved property for
purposes of water, sanitary sewer, or both, should be higher or lower
than the amount calculated under § 237-4, and shall agree on the
appropriate anticipated or presumed flow, the number so agreed shall
be the amount of flow assigned to the improved property at that time.
Any agreement under this Subsection C with respect to any particular
situation giving rise to an obligation to make a payment to the Borough
shall be made at or prior to the time that the payment is due to the
Borough.
D. Hearing before Borough Council. If an agreement under Subsection C
cannot be obtained, Borough Council shall conduct a hearing to
determine the anticipated or presumed flow which should be assigned
to the improved property. The Borough Council shall find that the
amount of flow is equal to the presumed flow under § 237-4, unless
either the Borough staff or the owner of the improved property shall
persuade the Borough Council that it is likely that the actual thirty-day
peak flow rate from or to the improved property will be more than 10%
higher or considerably lower than that presumed under § 237-4. All
hearings under this Subsection D with respect to any particular
situation giving rise to an obligation to make a payment to the Borough
shall be made at or prior to the time that the payment is due to the
Borough. Hearings shall not be deferred for extended periods of time
after the time payment is due to the Borough, nor shall any payments
made be subject to reconsideration and partial reimbursement through
hearings under this Subsection D which take place months or years
after the time payment is due to Borough. Anticipated flows are to be
determined based on reasonable estimates made at the time payment is
due, and not the actual usage data obtained after the fact by any
§ 237-5 JUNKYARDS § 237-5
170:553
§ 237-6. Appeal process.
The Borough Council is hereby appointed as a board of appeals, duly
constituted (in addition to other lawful powers and duties granted to it) and
authorized to review and adjudicate challenges by property owners to any
and all anticipated flow calculations used or to be used to assess or levy a
fee against any property owner whose property is served by the Borough
water system; provided that:

subjects and objects.
particular customer for any particular period, since such actual data
may not be representative of the peak demands which may be made by
an improved property on the municipal water and sewer systems when
the improved property is fully utilized.
A. The written notice of appeal must state the basis for such challenge,
and must have appended to it (or delivered with it) data in support
thereof, to provide a reasonable opportunity for resolution of the
dispute without the necessity of a hearing.
B. A decision made by the Borough as to an anticipated flow calculation
shall be presumed valid, so long as it is based upon substantial
evidence, or upon the best evidence available to or provided by the
property owner to the decisionmaker at the time the connection or
tapping fee was assessed.
C. A hearing on the appeal, if requested by the appellant, must be held
within 60 days of the date the appeal is filed with the Borough Council,
and a written decision must be mailed to the appellant's last known
address within 45 days of the date that the final hearing was officially
concluded. The written decision shall set forth the basis upon which the
Borough Council's decision is made.
D. A decision made by the Borough Council shall be deemed a final
determination, appealable only to the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh
County.

The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax

duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided,
be 1/2 rate of the rate and such 1/2 shall become effective without any
action on the part of the Council of the Borough of Catasauqua
provided, however, that the Borough of Catasauqua and any other
political subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2

rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under "The Local Tax Enabling Act."
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with

taxing under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister, and between a grandparent and

granted unless the recorder of deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all

which title is acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set
forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the
benefit of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.

conversion, energy production, pollution control, warehousing or
agriculture; and (ii) the agency or authority has the full ownership
interest in the real estate transferred.

persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.

interest in a real estate company or family farm corporation.

minerals and assignments thereof.
B. In order to exercise any exclusion provided in this section, the true, full
and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the Statement of
Value. A copy of the Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax Statement of
Value may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural
gas or minerals, the Statement of Value may be limited to an
explanation of the reason such document is not subject to tax under this
article.
A. A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change
does not affect the continuity of the company; and of itself or together
with prior changes has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or
when, because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition

170:601
§ 240-52. Levy of tax.
For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment within the Borough of
Catasauqua during the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such
privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall pay the tax for that
year in the amount of $52, assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with
the provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the following
purposes as the same may be allocated by the Borough of Catasauqua
from time to time: emergency services, which shall include emergency
medical services, police services and/or fire services; road construction and/
or maintenance; reduction of property taxes; or property tax relief through
implementation of a homestead and farmstead exclusion in accordance with
53 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 85, Subchapter F (relating to homestead property
exclusion). The political subdivision shall use no less than 25% of the funds
derived from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in addition to
all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the political
subdivision. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person may be employed.
§ 240-52.1. Exemption and refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this Subsection A(2), "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
§ 240-52 CATASAUQUA CODE § 240-52.1
170:602
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this Subsection B(3) is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating

exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the General Municipal
Law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Borough Manager or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth
of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payrollperiod
basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For
purposes of this Subsection B, "combined rate" shall mean the
aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the
municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
§ 240-52.1 CATASAUQUA CODE § 240-53
170:604
§ 240-54. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 240-55. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 13th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 240-56. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 13th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 240-57. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 240-52.1 of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 240-53 JUNKYARDS § 240-57
170:605
§ 240-58. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 240-59. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,

(municipalities may detail their appeal processes).
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll

Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with

date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of

occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

§ 275-1. Statement of findings.
The Council of the Borough of Catasauqua finds that:
§ 275-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare through the preservation of the Borough of Catasauqua's major
ground water resources to ensure a future supply of safe and healthful
drinking water for the municipality, local residents and employees and the
general public.
A. The ground water underlying the municipality is a major source of its
existing and future water supply, including drinking water.
B. The ground water aquifers are integrally connected with, are recharged
by, and flow into the surface waters, lakes and streams which constitute
a major source of drinking water for the region.
C. Accidental spills and discharges of toxic and hazardous materials may
threaten the quality of such ground water supplies and related water
resources in the Borough, thereby posing potential public health and
safety hazards.
D. Unless preventive measures are adopted to control the discharge and
storage of toxic and hazardous materials within the municipality, spills
and discharges of such materials may tend to occur and with greater
frequency and degree of hazard by reason of increasing construction,
commercial and industrial development, population and vehicular
traffic in the Borough.
E. The designation of Wellhead Protection Areas 1, 2 and 3 and careful
regulation of land use, physical facilities and other activities within
these areas can reduce the potential for ground water contamination.

such use as a special exception use if the applicant specifically proves
to the clear satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that all of the
following conditions would be met:
(1) The proposed use would be less intensive in external impacts and
nuisances than uses that are permitted in the district;
(2) The proposed use would be closely similar in impacts and character
to uses permitted in that district, considering the standards in
§ 280-58F;
(3) The use would meet the standards that would apply under

option informally request compliance.
(2) Enforcement notice. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the
owner of record of the parcel on which the violation has occurred,

constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly
described.

170:723
(3) Evidence; fees. In any appeal of an enforcement notice to the
Zoning Hearing Board, the Borough shall have the responsibility of
presenting its evidence first. Any filing fees paid by a party to
appeal an enforcement notice to the Zoning Hearing Board shall be
returned to the appealing party by the Borough if the Zoning
Hearing Board, or any court in a subsequent appeal, rules in the
appealing party's favor.
(4) Causes of action. If the enforcement notice is not complied with,
within the specified time period, the Zoning Officer shall notify
Borough Council. With the consent of Borough Council, the Zoning
Officer, Borough Solicitor or other officer of the Borough may
institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain,
correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to
prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or

reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Borough as a result
thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be

the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to
the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless a District
Justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed
that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the District
Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorney's fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be
paid over to the Borough. Imprisonment shall not be authorized by
this chapter. Any person found guilty of violating an ordinance shall
be assessed court costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by

Borough staff in writing.
(b) Standards. The Board may grant a variance only within the
limitations of state law. Note: As of the adoption date of this
chapter, the Municipalities Planning Code provided that all of
the following findings must be made, where relevant:
[1] There are unique physical circumstances or conditions
(including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot
size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property)
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
[2] Because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed
in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and
a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable
use of the property;
[3] Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
[4] The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
[5] The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(c) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
(4) Special exception.
(a) The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special
exceptions filed with the Borough staff in writing. The Board
shall only permit a special exception that is authorized by this
chapter. See § 280-16.
(b) Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning
Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes and intent of
this chapter.
§ 280-11 JUNKYARDS § 280-11
170:727
(5) Persons with disabilities. After the Zoning Officer receives a
complete written application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall grant
a special exception allowing modifications to specific requirements
of this chapter if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Hearing Board that such modifications are necessary to
provide a "reasonable accommodation" under applicable federal
law to serve persons who the applicant proves have "disabilities" as
defined in and protected by such laws.
(a) Such reasonable accommodations shall be requested in
accordance with the United States Fair Housing Amendments
Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., or the Americans with
Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and the federal
regulations adopted pursuant to such statutes, as amended,
and/or the accompanying regulations of the Pennsylvania
Human Relations Commission.
(b) If the applicant is requesting a reasonable accommodation
under such laws and regulations for persons with disabilities,
the applicant shall identify the disability which is protected by
such statutes, the extent of the modification of the provisions
of this chapter necessary for a reasonable accommodation, and
the manner by which the reasonable accommodation
requested may be removed when such person with a protected
disability no longer will be present on the property.

Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall apply. (Note: As of the
adoption date of this chapter, such provisions were in Section 915.1 of
such Act.208)
G. Time limits on permits and approvals.
(1) Unless otherwise provided by the Zoning Hearing Board of
Borough Council in a decision granting approval, after a variance is
approved or other zoning approval is officially authorized, then any
applicable zoning and building permits shall be secured by the
applicant within 12 months after the date of such approval or

(3) If an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits or begin
construction within the above time periods, or allows interruptions
in substantial construction of longer than 12 months, the Zoning
Officer may conclusively presume that the applicant has waived,
withdrawn or abandoned approvals and permits under this chapter
and may consider all such approvals and permits to have become
null and void.
A. Notice of hearings. Notice of all hearings of the Board shall be given as
follows:
(1) Ad. Public notice shall be published, as defined by Section 107 of
the State Municipalities Planning Code.209 The notice shall state

TC Town Center District
WOD Waterfront Overlay District
W Waterfront District
O Office District
IO Light Industrial/Office District

B. For the purposes of this chapter, the zoning districts named in
§ 280-20A shall be of the number, size, shape and location shown on the
Official Zoning Map. Any use of the abbreviations listed in § 280-20A
shall mean the district name that is listed beside the abbreviation.
C. Overlay districts. The Floodplain Area, as defined by Article V, shall
serve as an overlay district to the applicable underlying districts.
D. Purposes of each district. In addition to the overall purposes and
objectives of this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan, the purposes of
each zoning district are summarized below:
(1) R-1 Low Density Residential District: To provide for low density
residential neighborhoods that are primarily composed of singlefamily
detached dwellings; to protect these areas from
incompatible uses; to encourage owner-occupancy and
neighborhood stability.
(2) R-2 Medium Density Residential District: To provide for medium
density residential neighborhoods; to protect these areas from
§ 280-20 JUNKYARDS § 280-20
170:767
incompatible uses; to encourage "one home on one lot" (which may
be attached to another home) in order to promote home ownership
and neighborhood stability; to make sure that "infill" development
is consistent with neighboring development.
(3) R-3 High Density Residential District: To provide for high density
residential neighborhoods with a mix of housing types; to protect
these areas from incompatible uses.
(4) DC Downtown Commercial District: To promote pedestrian-friendly
commercial activities; to promote an appropriate mix of retail,
service, office, public, institutional and residential uses; to avoid
heavy auto-related commercial uses that are most likely to conflict
with nearby homes and the pedestrian-orientation, and which are
most likely to cause demolition of historic buildings.
(5) CG General Commercial District: To provide for a wide range of
commercial uses, including heavier commercial uses than are
allowed in the Downtown Commercial District.
(6) TC Town Center District: To provide for a wide range of commercial
uses, offices, services and light industrial uses; to encourage
coordinated exterior and interior traffic access, coordinated signs,
and shared parking.
(a) Waterfront Overlay District: To provide for mixed-use
development along the Lehigh River and the Lehigh Canal,
which serves to revitalize and enhance adjoining properties
while maintaining the essential neighborhood character of the
Borough. [Added 11-7-2005 by Ord. No. 1189]
(7) O Office District: To provide for office uses as a transitional use
between residential and industrial/airport uses.
(8) IO Industrial/Office District: To provide for industrial uses; to
carefully control the types of industrial operations to avoid
nuisances (such as excessive noise) and hazards.
(9) A Airport District: To provide for a range of airport uses, related
uses and industrial uses, particularly in land areas that can be
accessed from the interior road system of the airport or from major
highways.
(10) INS-1 Institutional-1 District: To provide for schools, nursing
homes and similar institutional uses on a tract of five or more acres
in a campus-type setting, in accordance with Attachment 2.223
[Amended 6-1-2009 by Ord. No. 1238]
(11) INS-2 Institutional-2 District: To provide for the adaptive reuse of
former institutional buildings and grounds on tracts of less than

five acres for schools, community centers and other similar
institutional uses, dormitories for schools, nursing homes,
apartments, live-work units, offices, cafes, conference centers,
hotels, exercise club/fitness centers/gymnasiums, green areas,
pedestrian plazas and parks, public parking garages, or a
combination thereof, in accordance with Attachment 2.224 [Added
6-1-2009 by Ord. No. 1238]
(12)W Waterfront District: To provide for the adaptive reuse and/or
demolition of industrial buildings and reuse of industrial land
through development which is planned or coordinated in such a
manner as to make use of environmentally challenged land in a
mixed-use form of development consisting of retail, commercial
and residential opportunities, consistent with the goals of
downtown and community revitalization. It is intended that
development in this zoning district reflect the historical character
of the Borough and augment the municipal and public facilities to
be constructed by the Borough. To accomplish these goals, a
measure of flexibility is provided to an applicant proposing mixeduse
development with respect to dimensional standards, unified
development standards, design standards and procedures of the
Zoning Ordinance, as well as opportunities for bonuses, such as
density bonuses and building coverage bonuses, all as deemed
appropriate by Borough Council following review and comment by
the Planning Commission. [Added 8-1-2016 by Ord. No. 1335]
A. The regulations set by this chapter shall apply uniformly to each class of
uses or structures within each district, except as provided for in this
chapter.
B. No structure shall hereafter be erected, used, constructed,
reconstructed, demolished, razed, moved, placed, altered or occupied
and no land shall hereafter be used, developed or occupied unless it is
in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the use and
district in which it is located.
C. No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall be
reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set
forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this chapter
shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this
chapter.
D. Boundary change. Any territory which may hereafter become part of
the Borough through annexation or a boundary adjustment shall be
classified as the R-1 Zoning District of Catasauqua Borough until or
unless such territory is otherwise classified by Borough Council.

chapter and is declared a part of this chapter.225 The Official Zoning
Map, which should bear the adoption date of this chapter and the words
"Official Zoning Map," shall be retained in the Borough Building.
B. Map changes. Changes to the boundaries and districts of the Official
Zoning Map shall only be made in conformity with the amendment
procedures specified in the Municipalities Planning Code. All changes
should be noted by date with a brief description of the nature of the
change, either on the map or within an appendix to this chapter.
C. Replacement map. If the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged,
destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of changes and
additions, or needs to have drafting errors or omissions corrected,
Borough Council may, by resolution, adopt a new copy of the Official
Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map.
Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost or has been totally
destroyed, the prior map or any remaining parts shall be preserved
together with all available records pertaining to its previous adoption or
amendment.
A. District boundary lines are intended to follow or be parallel to the
center line of street rights-of-way, creeks, railroads and lot lines
(according to official county records) as they existed at the time of the
adoption of this chapter, unless such district boundary lines are fixed by
dimensions as shown on the Official Zoning Map.
B. Where a district boundary is not fixed by dimensions and where it
approximately follows lot lines, such boundary shall be construed to
follow such lot lines unless specifically shown otherwise.
C. The location of a district boundary that divides a lot shall be determined
by the use of the scale appearing on the Zoning Map unless indicated
otherwise by dimensions.
D. Where a municipal boundary divides a lot, the minimum lot area shall
be regulated by the municipality in which the principal use(s) are
located, unless otherwise provided by applicable case law. The land
area within each municipality shall be regulated by the use regulations
and other applicable regulations of each municipality.

(2) For a building regulated by this § 280-27, all of the provisions of the
applicable underlying zoning district shall also continue to apply, in
addition to the provisions of this § 280-27. In the event there is a
direct conflict between the provisions of § 280-27 and the
228. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10603, 10604 and 10605.
§ 280-26 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-27
170:774
underlying zoning district, the provision that is most restrictive
upon development, demolition and uses shall apply.
C. General provisions.
(1) Any partial or complete demolition of a building regulated by this
§ 280-27 that is visible from a public street shall only occur in
compliance with this § 280-27.
(2) The Historic Districts on the Zoning Map may be revised by
Borough Council as a zoning ordinance amendment.
(3) Definitions. In addition to the definitions provided in § 280-19, the
following terms shall have the following meanings for the purposes
of this § 280-27:
DEMOLITION  The dismantling, tearing down, removal or razing
of the exterior of a building, in whole or in part. This term shall
not include changes to the interior of a building, provided such
changes do not alter the structural integrity of the building.
DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT  The absence of routine
maintenance and repair which leads to structural weakness, decay
and deterioration in a building to a point that causes a need for
major repair or may cause a need for demolition.
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR  Work that does not alter the
appearance or harm the stability of exterior features of a building.
STREETSCAPE  The overall appearance of a block along a public
street, including yards visible from a public street, the relationship
of building setbacks, the consistency of architectural styles or
features, the spacing and shapes of windows and doors and
rooflines and similar features that give the block its distinctive
visual character.
D. Approval of demolition of building regulated by § 280-27.
(1) A building regulated by this § 280-27 shall not be demolished, in
whole or in part, unless the applicant proves by credible evidence
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board as a special
exception use that one or more of the following conditions exists:
(a) The existing building cannot feasibly and reasonably be
reused, and that such situation is not the result of intentional
neglect or demolition by neglect by the owner; or
(b) The denial of the demolition would result in unreasonable
economic hardship to the owner, and the hardship was not selfcreated;
or
(c) The demolition is necessary to allow a project to occur that will
have substantial, special and unusual public benefit that would
greatly outweigh the loss of the building regulated by § 280-27,
§ 280-27 JUNKYARDS § 280-27
170:775
and the project needs to occur at this location (for example,
a demolition may be needed for a necessary expansion of an
existing public building or to allow a street improvement that
is necessary to alleviate a public safety hazard); or
(d) The existing building has no historical or architectural
significance and the demolition will not adversely impact upon
the streetscape. To meet this condition, the applicant may
present information concerning the proposed design of any
replacement building or use to show that the proposed
building or use will result in a net improvement to the
streetscape.
(2) For approval of a demolition, the standards of this § 280-27 shall
apply in place of the special exception use standards of Article I. In
reviewing the application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
the following:
(a) The effect of the demolition on the historical significance,
streetscape and architectural integrity of neighboring historic
buildings and on the historic character of the surrounding
neighborhood.
(b) The feasibility of other alternatives to demolition.
(3) An application for partial or complete demolition of a building
regulated by this § 280-27 shall not be approved unless all of the
requirements of this § 280-27 have been met. A partial demolition
shall include, but not be limited to, removal of an attached porch
roof, removal of porch columns and removal of architectural
features. See definition of "demolition" above.
(4) A complete application for the demolition shall be submitted by the
applicant in writing. This application shall include the following:
(a) The name, address and daytime telephone number of the
owner of record and the applicant for the demolition.
(b) Recent exterior photographs of the building proposed for
demolition. If the applicant is alleging that the building cannot
be reused or rehabilitated, then interior photos and floor plans
shall be provided as needed to support the applicant's claim.
(c) A site plan drawn to scale showing existing buildings and the
proposed demolition.
(d) A written statement of the reasons for the demolition.
(e) The proposed use of the site, and a proposed timeline for
development of that proposed use.
(5) Procedures. The demolition application shall be submitted to the
Zoning Hearing Board for consideration as a special exception use.
§ 280-27 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-27
170:776
The applicant shall be informed of meeting dates where the
application is intended to be discussed and encouraged to be
present to discuss the proposed demolition.
(6) Evidence. The applicant shall provide sufficient credible evidence
to justify any claims that a building cannot feasibly be repaired or
reused. The following types of expert testimony and documentation
are encouraged to be provided: a property appraisal, income and
expense statements for the property, a written estimate of the costs
of rehabilitation by a qualified contractor, a written report from a
professional engineer regarding the structural soundness of the
building, testimony concerning efforts to market the property over
time, information regarding the applicant's purchase price of the
building, and similar relevant information.
(7) Self-created conditions. The conditions that justify the proposed
demolition of a building regulated by this § 280-27 shall not have
been self-created by the applicant. These conditions include, but
are not limited to:
(a) Lack of proper maintenance of the building, including but not
limited to structural elements, the roof, windows or
architectural elements; or
(b) Leaving parts of a building open to the elements or accessible
to vandalism.
(8) The Zoning Officer may require any unoccupied building shall be
properly sealed and secured to prevent decay from the elements
and vandalism.
(9) Emergency. The Zoning Officer may issue a permit for the
demolition without compliance with this § 280-27 if the Building
Inspector certifies in writing that the building represents a clear
and immediate hazard to public safety, and that no other
reasonable alternatives exist to demolition.
(10) Exceptions. Special exception use approval shall not be needed for
the following:
(a) Demolition of accessory buildings or structures.
(b) Interior renovations or removal of features (such as a rear
porch) that do not harm the structural stability of the building
and that are not visible from a public street (not including an
alley).
(c) Removal of features that were added after 1940, such as a
modern porch or aluminum siding or carport.
(d) Relocation of a building within the Borough, provided that the
relocation does not result in a partial or complete demolition
that is regulated by this section.
§ 280-27 JUNKYARDS § 280-27
170:777
E. Demolition by neglect (see definition above).
(1) Every property owner of a building regulated by this § 280-27 shall
repair and maintain the building to avoid demolition by neglect.
(2) Every property owner of a building regulated by this § 280-27 shall
properly repair and maintain the building to maintain the
structural integrity of the building and to protect the building and
attached features from damage from the elements. The attached
features that shall be protected, repaired and maintained include
the roof, cornice, columns, beams, posts and lintels.
(3) If a property owner fails to comply with an order from the Building
Inspector to repair a building regulated by this § 280-27 to correct
a code violation that threatens the structural integrity of a building,
such matter shall be considered a violation of this § 280-27E and
the property owner may also be cited for a violation of this chapter.
F. Guidelines. The following advisory guidelines should be considered in
the design of new construction, additions and exterior alterations in a
block with historic buildings. Some of these features may be required
by other sections of this chapter in specific cases.
(1) Vehicle parking and any garage doors should be placed to the rear
of buildings as opposed to between buildings and the street. Where
rear parking is not practical, then parking should be provided to
the side of a building. Where a driveway needs to enter from the
front, the garage should be setback further from the street than the
house, and the driveway should be as narrow as practical through
the front yard.
(2) New construction should have a front yard setback that is similar to
adjacent older buildings.
(3) Modern additions and features should be placed towards the rear
of the property.
(4) New construction should have rooflines that are similar to adjacent
older buildings. Flat roofs should be avoided. Where a pitched roof
is not practical, then the roof should at least appear to have angles
and a pitch when viewed from the street.
(5) On sides visible from a street, new construction should use building
materials that are similar to appearance older buildings, including
brick and stone. Modern building materials are available that have
a historic appearance, such as artificial stone.
(6) Where existing older buildings have a certain horizontal or vertical
orientation, that orientation should be continued in new
construction. Where existing older buildings have a certain spacing
of windows and doors, similar spacing (and similar sizes of
windows and doors) should be continued in new construction.
§ 280-27 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-27
170:778
Blank walls without door and window openings should be avoided
along a street.
G. Additional uses allowed within a building regulated by § 280-27.
(1) This § 280-27G allows certain additional uses if the use would be
within a rehabilitated principal building built before December 31,
1940, that is within a Historic District.
(2) The following additional use shall be allowed within a building
regulated by § 280-27 in any zoning district:
(a) The conversion of a building regulated by § 280-27 into a bedand-
breakfast inn. Such use shall meet the applicable
requirements of § 280-29.
(b) The conversion of a building regulated by § 280-27 into an
office, without having to meet the requirements for a home
occupation.
(3) To be eligible for these uses, the applicant shall prove the following
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that a registered
architect with substantial experience in the rehabilitation of
historic buildings provides a written certification that the exterior
of the building as visible from public streets will be historically

ARTICLE IV
Additional Requirements for Specific Uses
§ 280-28. Applicability.
§ 280-29. Additional requirements for specific principal uses.
A. This article establishes additional specific requirements for certain
specific uses, in addition to the sign, parking, environmental and other
general requirements of this chapter and the requirements of each
district. Wherever two requirements conflict, the stricter requirement
shall apply.
B. For uses allowed within a specific zoning district as special exception
uses, see also the procedures and standards in § 280-16.
A. Each of the following uses shall meet all of the following requirements
for that use:
(1) Adult use. (This is limited to the following: adult bookstore, adult
movie theater, massage parlor or adult live entertainment use.)
(a) Purposes. The regulations on adult uses are intended to serve
the following purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of
this chapter:
[1] To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses
that affect health, safety and general welfare concerns of
the municipality. These secondary impacts have been
documented in research conducted across the nation.
These secondary impacts typically include, but are not
limited to: increases in criminal activity, increases in
activities that increase the risk of transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases, increases in activities that increase
the risk of transmission of other communicable diseases,
increases in blight, decreases in the stability of residential
neighborhoods, and decreases in property values for
surrounding homes, and decreases in the marketability of
nearby commercial business space. The research
conducted across the nation concludes that adult uses
typically involve insufficient self-regulation to control
these secondary effects.
[2] To limit adult uses to locations where these secondary
impacts can be minimized, particularly as they affect
residential neighborhoods and downtown revitalization.
[3] To not attempt to suppress any activities protected by the
"free speech" protections of the U.S. Constitution, but
instead to control secondary effects.
§ 280-28 JUNKYARDS § 280-29
170:781
(b) No portion of a building occupied by an adult use shall be
located within any of the following distances:

primary or secondary school, place of worship, public
park, day care center or child nursery.
(c) No such use shall be located within 1,000 lineal feet of any
existing adult use.
(d) A fifty-foot buffer yard shall be provided, regardless of zoning
district, along the side and rear lot lines in accordance with

booths of any kind are prohibited. This specifically includes,
but is not limited to, booths for viewing adult movies or nude
dancers.
(l) No use may include live actual or simulated sex acts nor any
sexual contact between entertainers nor between entertainers
and customers. This shall specifically prohibit, but not be
limited to, entertainers dancing on the laps of customers.
(m) Only "lawful" massages as defined by state court decisions
shall be performed in a massage parlor.

fees established and amended from time to time by resolution
of Borough Council, has been paid in full. The schedule of fees
shall be kept on file at Borough Hall.
(h) The applicant/property owner shall well and truly save,
indemnify, defend and keep harmless the Borough, its officers,
employees and agents from and against any and all actions,

connection with such outdoor cafe.
(i) There shall be no advertising displayed on umbrellas or tables
which are located on the sidewalk directly abutting or adjacent
to the outdoor cafe.
(j) There shall be no temporary signs or banners permitted

acceptable to the Borough which are located at the exterior of
the premises.
(m) The owner shall maintain the outdoor cafe in accordance with
the Borough ordinances and state and federal laws, as well as
rules and regulations promulgated and adopted by the
Borough which pertain to this use of outdoor cafes.
(n) The owner shall remove the outdoor cafe within 30 days after
written notice if the Borough or the Zoning Officer determines
that the outdoor cafe is detrimental to the health, safety and
general welfare of the Borough or its citizens because one or
more of the following conditions has occurred:
[1] Due to pedestrian traffic changes, the outdoor cafe
narrows the sidewalk to the extent that pedestrian traffic
is impeded.
[2] The outdoor cafe interferes with the maintenance or
installation of an underground utility structure.

cost thereof. Should the outdoor cafe be removed by the
Borough, the owner shall be entitled to a return of the
equipment, furnishings or appurtenances so removed only
after the payment of all costs due to the Borough and by
requesting the return in writing. The responsibility for removal

§ 280-36. Odors and dust.
No use shall generate odors or dust that are offensive to persons of average
sensitivities beyond the boundaries of the subject lot.
§ 280-37. Control of light and glare.
This § 280-37 shall only regulate exterior lighting that spills across lot lines
or onto public streets.
(6) Unamplified human voices.
(7) Vehicles operating on a public street, railroads and aircraft.
A. Purposes: To control outdoor lighting for safety, security, nighttime
privacy and nighttime enjoyment of residential property; to minimize
excessive outdoor lighting and control glare that can pose a danger to
motorists; to make sure lighting is properly shielded and directed.
B. Street lighting exempted. This § 280-37 shall not apply to street lighting
that is owned, financed or maintained by the Borough or the state, to
temporary emergency lighting, or to an individual porch light of a
dwelling.
C. Definitions. For the purposes of this § 280-37, the following definitions
shall apply:
DIRECTLY VISIBLE  Allowing a direct line of sight to the light source
or lamp.
FOOTCANDLE  The amount of light striking a vertical or horizontal
plane, measured in lumens per square foot. One footcandle equals one
lumen per square foot.
FULL CUTOFF LIGHT FIXTURE  A light fixture for which no light
output is emitted above 90° horizontal at any lateral angle around the
fixture.
FULLY SHIELDED LIGHT FIXTURE  A light fixture with all light
emitted from the fixture being projected below the horizontal.
D. Height of lights. No luminaire, spotlight or other light source that is
within 150 feet of a lot line of an existing primarily residential use lot
shall be placed at a height exceeding 25 feet above the average
surrounding ground level. This limitation shall not apply to lights
needed for air safety nor lights intended solely to illuminate an
architectural feature of a building, nor lighting of outdoor public
recreation facilities.
E. Diffused. All light sources, including signs, shall be properly diffused as
needed with a translucent or similar cover to prevent exposed bulbs
from being directly visible from streets, public sidewalks, dwellings or
adjacent lots.
§ 280-35 JUNKYARDS § 280-37
170:843
F. Shielding. All light sources, including signs, shall be installed and
maintained so that they are shielded around the light source and
carefully directed, aimed and placed to prevent the lighting from
creating a nuisance to persons in adjacent dwellings, and to prevent the
lighting from shining into the eyes of passing motorists.
G. Flickering. Flashing, flickering or strobe lighting are prohibited, except
for temporary nonadvertising seasonal lights between October 25 and
January 10.
H. Spillover. Exterior lighting on a lot shall not cause a spillover of light
onto a residential lot after 10:00 p.m. that exceeds 0.1 horizontal
footcandle at a residential lot line. Exterior lighting on a lot shall not
cause a spillover of light onto a street that exceeds five footcandles.
I. Gasoline sales canopies. Any canopy over gasoline pumps shall have a
maximum distance between the ground level and the underside of the
canopy of 20 feet. If the ground level is sloped, or the canopy is sloped
to deflect noise and soot away from neighboring properties, then a
portion of the canopy may have a greater height, provided that the
maximum height is 20 feet at the portion of the canopy that is closest an
adjacent street. All light fixtures under the canopy shall be recessed
into the canopy or screened by an extension around the bottom of the
canopy so that lighting elements are not visible from another lot or
street.
J. Hours of sign lighting. If an internally lit sign is within a residential
district or across the street from a residential district, the lighting shall
be turned off between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. if the use is
not open to the public during those hours. If such use is open to the
public between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., the lighting of the sign shall
be turned off a maximum of 30 minutes after the use closes to the
public.

A. General. Parking spaces, aisles and driveways shall be laid out to result
in safe and orderly use, and to fully take into account all of the
following: vehicular access onto and off the site, vehicular movement
within the site, loading areas, pedestrian patterns and any drivethrough
facilities. No parking area shall cause a safety hazard or
impediment to traffic off the lot.
B. Existing parking. Any parking spaces serving such preexisting
structures or uses at the time of adoption of this article shall not in the
future be reduced in number below the number required by this article.
§ 280-38 JUNKYARDS § 280-39
170:851
C. Change in use or expansion. A structure or use in existence at the
effective date of this article that expands or results in a change of use of
an existing principal building shall be required to provide all of the
required parking for the entire size and type of the resulting use, except
as follows: [Amended 6-1-2009 by Ord. No. 1238]
(1) If an existing lawful business or institutional use includes less
parking than would be required, and the applicant proves to the
Zoning Officer that there is insufficient area on the lot to meet the
required amount of parking, then that deficit of parking shall be
grandfathered for new business or institutional uses. For example,
if an existing store included three parking spaces and was required
to provide seven spaces, there is a deficit of four spaces. Therefore,
if that store is converted to an office that would need 10 spaces, the
office would need to provide a total of six spaces (10 minus the
preexisting deficit of four).
(2) If a business or institutional use expands by an aggregate total
maximum of 10% in the applicable measurement (such as building
floor area) beyond what existed at the time of adoption of this
article, and the applicant proves to the Zoning Officer that there is
insufficient area on the lot to meet the required amount of parking,
then no additional parking is required. For example, if an existing
building included 3,000 square feet, and a single minor addition of
300 square feet was proposed, then additional parking would not
be required.
D. Continuing obligation of parking and loading spaces. All required
numbers of parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be
available as long as the use or building which the spaces serve still
exist, and such spaces shall not be reduced in number below the
minimum required by this article. No required parking area or off-street
loading spaces shall be used for any other use (such as storage or
display of materials) that interferes with the area's availability for
parking. [Amended 6-1-2009 by Ord. No. 1238]
E. Location of parking. Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the
same lot or abutting lot with the principal use served, unless special
exception approval is granted. The only standard that must be met to
obtain the special exception approval is for the applicant to prove to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that a method of providing the
spaces is guaranteed to be available during all of the years the use is in
operation within 300 feet walking distance from the entrance of the
principal use being served. This distance may be increased to 400 feet
for employee parking. A written and signed lease shall be provided. The
Zoning Hearing Board may require that the use be approved for period
of time consistent with the lease of the parking, and that a renewal of
the permit shall only be approved if the parking lease is renewed.

F. Flexibility in parking. [Amended 6-1-2009 by Ord. No. 1238]
§ 280-39 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-39
170:852
§ 280-40. Design standards for off-street parking.
(1) As a special exception, an applicant may prove to the satisfaction of
the Zoning Hearing Board that the minimum amount of off-street
parking should be modified for a specific application because of one
or more of the following characteristics:
(a) The applicant proves that parking will be shared with another
use that will reduce the total amount of parking needed
because the uses have different peak times of parking need,
and that there is a legally guaranteed method to make sure
that the parking will continue to be available during all of the
years that the use is in operation; or
(b) The applicant proves that the parking demand for a particular
use is unusually low because of some unusual and peculiar
characteristic of the use.
(2) The document titled "Shared Parking, Second Edition," by the
Urban Land Institute, 2005, or the most recent edition thereof,
shall be utilized when computing shared parking spaces.
A. General requirements.
(1) Backing onto a street. No parking area shall be designed to require
or encourage parked vehicles to back into a public street in order
to leave a parking space, except for a single-family dwelling with its
access onto a local street or parking court. Parking spaces may
back onto an alley.
(2) Every required parking space shall be designed so that each motor
vehicle may proceed to and from the parking space provided for it
without requiring the moving of any other vehicle, except for
spaces serving a single-family, twin or townhouse dwelling.
(3) Parking areas shall not be within a required buffer yard or street
right-of-way.
(4) Separation from street. Except for parking spaces immediately in
front of individual dwellings, all areas for off-street parking, offstreet
loading and unloading and the storage or movement of motor
vehicles shall be physically separated from the street by a
continuous grass or landscaped planting strip, except for necessary
and approved vehicle entrances and exits to the lot.
(5) Stacking and obstructions. Each lot shall provide adequate area
upon the lot to prevent backup of vehicles on a public street while
awaiting entry to the lot, or while waiting for service at a drivethrough
facility.
B. Size and marking of parking spaces.
§ 280-39 JUNKYARDS § 280-40
170:853
(1) Each parking space shall be a rectangle with a minimum width of
nine feet and a minimum length of 18 feet, except the minimum
length shall be 22 feet for parallel parking.
(2) For handicapped spaces, see § 280-40G below.
(3) All spaces shall be marked to indicate their location, except those
of a single-family dwelling.
C. Aisles.
(1) Each aisle providing for one-way traffic to access parking stalls
shall have the following minimum width:
Angle of Parking
(degrees)
Minimum Aisle Width
(feet)
Parallel or 30° 12
45° 14
60° 18
90° 20
(2) Each aisle providing access to stalls for two-way traffic shall be a
minimum of 24 feet in width, except a width of 20 feet may be
allowed for parking areas with spaces that are parallel or involve
an angle of parking of 45° or less.
D. Driveways.
(1) Width of Driveway
Width of Driveway at Entrance
onto a Public Street, at the Edge
of the Cartway1 1-Way Use 2-Way Use
Minimum 12 feet1 25 feet1
Maximum 20 feet1 30 feet1
NOTE:
1 Unless a different standard is required by PennDOT for an
entrance to a state road, or the applicant proves to the satisfaction
of the Zoning Officer that a wider width is needed for tractortrailer
trucks.
(2) Drainage. Adequate provisions shall be made to maintain
uninterrupted parallel drainage along a public street at the point of
driveway entry. The Borough may require an applicant to install an
appropriate type and size of pipe at a driveway crossing.
E. Paving, grading and drainage.
§ 280-40 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-40
170:854
(1) Parking and loading facilities and including driveways shall be
graded and adequately drained to prevent erosion or excessive
water flow across streets or adjoining properties.
(2) Except for landscaped areas, all portions of required parking,
loading facilities and driveways shall be surfaced with asphalt,
concrete, paving block or other materials preapproved by the
Borough (such as acceptable porous paving material).
F. Lighting of parking areas: see "light and glare control" in Article V.
G. Handicapped parking.
(1) Number of spaces. Any lot including four or more off-street parking
spaces shall include a minimum of one handicapped space. The
following number of handicapped spaces shall be provided, unless
a revised regulation is officially established under the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act:
Total Number of
Parking Spaces on the
Lot
Required Minimum Number/
Percent
of Handicapped Parking Spaces
4 to 25 1
26 to 50 2
51 to 75 3
76 to 100 4

201 to 300 7
301 to 400 8
401 to 500 9
501 to 1,000 2% of required number of spaces
1,001 or more 20 plus 1% of required number of
spaces over 1,000
(2) Location. Handicapped parking spaces shall be located where they
would result in the shortest reasonable accessible distance to a
handicapped accessible building entrance. Curb cuts shall be
provided as needed to provide access from the handicapped
spaces.
(3) Minimum size. Each required handicapped parking space shall be
eight feet by 18 feet. In addition, each space shall be adjacent to a
five-foot-wide access aisle. Such access aisle may be shared by two
handicapped spaces by being placed between them. However, one
out of every eight required handicapped parking spaces shall have
an adjacent access aisle of eight feet width instead of five feet.
§ 280-40 JUNKYARDS § 280-40
170:855
§ 280-41. Off-street loading.
(4) Slope. Handicapped parking spaces shall be located in areas of less
than 6% slope in any direction.
(5) Marking. All required handicapped spaces shall be well-marked by
clearly visible signs or pavement markings. Blue paint is
recommended.
(6) Paving. Handicapped parking spaces and adjacent areas needed to
access them with a wheelchair shall be covered with a smooth
surface that is usable with a wheelchair.
A. Each use shall provide off-street loading facilities, which meet the
requirements of this section, sufficient to accommodate the maximum
demand generated by the use and the maximum size vehicle that will
service the use, in a manner that will not routinely obstruct traffic on a
public street. If a reasonable alternative does not exist, traffic may be
obstructed for occasional loading and unloading along an alley.
B. At the time of review under this article, the applicant shall provide
evidence to the Zoning Officer showing that the use will have sufficient
numbers and sizes of loading facilities. The Planning Commission and/
or Borough Council may provide advice to the Zoning Officer on this
matter as part of any plan review by such boards. For the purposes of
this section, the words "loading" and "unloading" are used
interchangeably.
C. Each space and the needed maneuvering room shall not intrude into
approved buffer areas and landscaped areas.
D. Fire lanes. Fire lanes shall be provided where required by state or
federal regulations or other local ordinances. The specific locations of
these lanes are subject to review by Borough fire officials.

ARTICLE VII
Signs
§ 280-42. Purpose and applicability.
§ 280-43. Nonconforming signs.
§ 280-44. Miscellaneous signs not requiring permits.
A. Purposes. This article is intended to promote and maintain overall
community aesthetic quality; establish reasonable time, place and
manner of regulations for the exercise of free speech, without
regulating content; promote traffic safety by avoiding distractions and
sight distance obstructions; and protect property values and ensure
compatibility with the character of neighboring uses.
B. Permit required. A zoning permit shall be required for all signs except
for signs meeting the requirements of § 280-44 and nonilluminated
window signs constructed of paper, posterboard or similar materials
and that are not of a permanent nature. Only types, sizes and heights of
signs that are specifically permitted by this article within the applicable
district shall be allowed.
C. Changes on signs. Any lawfully existing sign (including nonconforming
signs) may be painted or repaired or changed in logo or message
without a new permit under this article provided that the changes do
not increase the sign area or otherwise result in noncompliance or an
increased nonconformity with this article.
A. Signs legally existing at the time of enactment of this article and which
do not conform to the requirements of the chapter shall be considered
nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign shall not be expanded or
extended in any manner that would make it more nonconforming.
B. After a permit has been issued, an existing lawful nonconforming sign
may be replaced with a new sign, provided the new sign is not more
nonconforming in any manner than the previous sign.
A. The following signs shall be permitted by right within all zoning
districts within the following regulations, and shall not be required to
have a permit under this article:

f) If the sign projects over the public right-of-way, the Borough
may require a hold harmless agreement that protects the
Borough from liability.
2. A maximum of one sidewalk sign (or "sandwich board sign") shall
be permitted per lot, provided:
§ 280-45 JUNKYARDS § 280-45
170:869
NOTES:
a) Such sign has a maximum sign area of eight square feet on
each of two sides and a maximum width of three feet, and has a
maximum height of four feet;
b) Such sign is taken indoors during all hours when the business is
not open to the public;
c) Such sign is not in a location that would interfere with
pedestrian traffic, emergency access or parking spaces and
retains a four-foot-wide minimum clear path for pedestrians, and
such sign is kept as close to the building as is feasible;
d) Such sign is attractive, well-maintained and durably
constructed; and
e) Such sign may be placed within the right-of-way if there is no
location available that would be outside of the right-of-way.
2 If the permitted freestanding sign area is not used, such sign area
may be added to the permitted wall sign area. An auto service station
may also include an additional 24 square feet of sign area to display
fuel prices.
3 If a lot includes three or more distinct business establishments or
has more than 100 feet of frontage along a street, then along a single
street, the maximum freestanding sign area may be increased to 50
square feet.
4 See sign bonus in § 280-45E below. See setbacks for freestanding
signs in § 280-47A.
B. Height of wall signs. The maximum height of wall signs shall be equal to
the top of the roof along the wall to which they are attached. If a
nonstructural extension is added to a roof, the maximum height of the
wall sign shall be the top of the structural roof.
C. Portable signs (including "signs on mobile stands") and other temporary
signs.
(1) Purpose. These standards recognize portable signs as a particular
type of sign that has the characteristics of a temporary sign but
that has been inappropriately used as a permanent sign. This
section is based on the policy that if a use desires to regularly
display a sign for regularly changing messages, that it erect a
permanent sign within all of the requirements of this article.
(2) Definition of a "portable sign": a freestanding sign that is attached
to a chassis or legs that allows it to be towed or carried from one
location to another and that is not permanently attached to the
ground.
(3) Portable signs are prohibited in all districts, except as a temporary
charitable event sign complying with § 280-44.
§ 280-45 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-45
170:870
§ 280-46. Abandoned or outdated signs.
§ 280-47. Location of signs.
The following shall regulate the location of signs:
D. Signs on freestanding walls. A freestanding sign may be attached to a
decorative masonry or stone wall with a maximum height of five feet
and a maximum length of 10 feet, without being regulated by the wall
setback regulations of this chapter and with the wall itself not counting
towards the maximum sign area. Sight distance requirements shall still
be met.
E. Sign area bonus. In a commercial district, the maximum sign area for a
freestanding sign may be increased by 25% beyond the size that would
otherwise be allowed if the sign is not internally illuminated, and if the
base of the sign is surrounded by landscaping.
A. Signs advertising a use no longer in existence shall be removed within
90 days of the cessation of such use. If the owner of a property does not
remove such sign within 30 days after receiving a written notice from
the Zoning Officer, the sign may be removed by the Borough at the
expense of the property owner.
B. These time limits shall not apply to a sign intended to be reused with a
new sign face serving a building that is clearly temporarily vacant and
being offered to new tenants or for purchase.
A. Setbacks. A sign shall not intrude into or project over an existing street
right-of-way, unless specifically authorized by a permit from the
Borough or PennDOT. Projecting signs meeting the requirements for
such signs and official signs shall be allowed within the right-of-way.
The Borough Police Department, Zoning Officer or his/her designee or
any other person shall have the authority to remove and dispose of
unauthorized signs within the street right-of-way or that are attached to
a utility pole or tree. Borough Council may approve a temporary banner
over a street cartway to advertise a charitable or Borough-sponsored
event.
B. Sight clearance. No sign shall be so located that it interferes with the
sight clearance requirements of § 280-56C.
C. Off-premises. No signs except permitted off-premises, official, political
or public service signs shall be erected on a property to which it does
not relate.
D. Permission of owner. No sign shall be posted on any property or sign
pole or public utility pole, unless permission has been received from the
owner.
§ 280-45 JUNKYARDS § 280-48
170:871
§ 280-48. Illumination of signs.
See "light and glare control" in Article V (including § 280-37H) and
provisions in § 280-45A within residential districts.
§ 280-49. Vehicles functioning as signs.
Any vehicle or trailer displaying a sign area greater than 20 square feet
that is being used in such a manner that the carrying of sign(s) no longer
is incidental to the primary purpose of the vehicle or trailer but becomes
a primary purpose in itself shall be considered a freestanding sign and
shall be subject to all of the requirements for freestanding signs. This shall
include, but not be limited to, a vehicle that is parked in the front yard of a
business within clear view of a street and that is not moved to another lot at
least once a week.
§ 280-50. Prohibited signs.
A. Any moving object used to attract attention to a commercial use shall be
prohibited. Any banner or flag that does not meet the requirements of
this article shall be prohibited.
B. Flashing, blinking, twinkling, animated or moving signs of any type
shall be prohibited. A sign may electronically change from one message
to another message provided the message does not flash. In addition,
flashing lights visible from a street shall not be used to attract attention
to a business. This restriction specifically includes window signs, but
does not prohibit seasonal Christmas lighting or displays that comply
with § 280-44.
C. Signs which emit smoke, visible vapors or particles, sound or odor shall
be prohibited.
D. Signs are prohibited which contain information that states that a lot
may be used for any purpose not permitted under the applicable
provisions of this chapter.
E. Signs shall be prohibited that are of such character, form, shape or
color that they imitate or resemble any official traffic sign, signal or
device or that have any characteristics which are likely to confuse or
distract the operator of a motor vehicle on a public street (such as
prominent use of the words "Danger").
F. Signs or displays visible from a lot line that include words or images
that are obscene or pornographic shall be prohibited.
G. Balloons of greater than 40 cubic feet that are tethered to the ground or
a structure for periods of 12 hours shall be prohibited.
H. Floodlights and outdoor lasers used for advertising purposes shall be
prohibited.
§ 280-48 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-51
170:872
§ 280-51. Construction of signs.
Every sign (except allowed temporary signs) shall be constructed of durable
materials. Every sign shall be kept in good condition and repair. The Zoning
Officer shall by written notice require a property owner or lessee to repair
or remove a damaged, dilapidated or unsafe sign within a specified period of
time. If such order is not complied with, the Borough may repair or remove
such sign at the expense of such owner or lessee.
§ 280-52. Measurement and major types of signs.
A. Sign definitions. The following definitions shall be used in determining
whether signs meet the measurement and type requirements of this
article:
BUILDING FACE  The vertical area of a particular side of a building,
but not including the area of any slanted roof.
FREESTANDING SIGN  See Article II.
HEIGHT OF SIGN  The vertical distance measured from the average
ground level surrounding a sign to the highest point of the sign and
its supporting structure. Religious symbols shall not be restricted by
the sign heights of this article when extending above the roofline or
attached to a tower or spire of a place of worship.
ILLUMINATED SIGN, INTERNALLY  A sign illuminated by light from
within the sign rather than a source adjacent to or outside of the sign. A
sign within a display case with lights only shining onto the front of the
sign shall be considered to be externally illuminated.
OFF-PREMISES SIGN  See Article II.
SIGN  See Article II.
WALL SIGN  A sign primarily supported by or painted on a wall of a
building and which does not project more than two feet from such wall.
A wall sign may project up to three feet if it is attached to an awning.
WINDOW SIGN  A sign which is readily visible and can be at least
partially read from an exterior lot line and which is attached to a
window or transparent door or that can be read through a window or
transparent door.
B. Measurement of sign area.
(1) Sign area shall include all lettering, wording and accompanying
designs and symbols, together with related background areas on
which they are displayed. One freestanding sign may include
several signs that are all attached to one structure, with the total
sign area being the area of a common geometric form that could
encompass all signs.
(2) The sign area shall not include any structurally supporting
framework, bracing, or supports if such area does not include any
§ 280-51 JUNKYARDS § 280-52
170:873
§ 280-53. Off-premises signs (including billboards).
display, lettering or sign and if such area is clearly incidental to the
sign area itself.
(3) Where the sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached to
or painted directly on a building or window, other than an
illuminated background that is a part of the sign, the sign area shall
be the smallest rectangle that includes all of the letters and
symbols.
(4) The maximum sign area shall be for each of two sides of a sign,
provided that only one side of a sign is readable from any location.
(5) Unless otherwise specified, all square footages in regards to signs
are maximum sizes.
A. Purposes. Off-premises signs are controlled by this article for the
following purposes: to ensure that a physical environment is maintained
that is attractive to desirable types of development; to prevent visual
pollution in the Borough and protect property values, especially in
consideration of the fact that most commercial areas of the Borough are
within close proximity to existing residences; to prevent glare on
adjacent property and streets; to avoid the creation of additional visual
distractions to motorists, especially along busy arterial streets that
involve complex turning movements and numerous traffic hazards; to
recognize the numerous alternative forms of free speech available in
the Borough, including existing nonconforming off-premises signs and
on-premises signs; to carry out the purposes listed in § 280-42.
B. Nonconforming off-premises signs. This section is not intended to
require the removal of an existing lawfully placed off-premises sign that
is in structurally sound condition.
C. PennDOT sign. Signs erected and maintained by PennDOT are
permitted by right in all districts.
D. Permitted off-premises signs. Except for signs allowed by § 280-44, an
off-premises sign is only permitted if it meets the following
requirements:
(1) District. An off-premises sign is only permitted in the A District.
(2) Location. An off-premises sign shall be set back a minimum of 25
feet from all lot lines and street rights-of-way.
(3) Maximum sign area: 300 square feet.
(4) Spacing. Any off-premises sign shall be separated by a minimum of
1,000 feet from any other off-premises sign, including signs on
either side of a street and including existing signs in other
municipalities. No lot shall include more than one off-premises
sign.
§ 280-52 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-53
170:874
(5) Maximum height: 35 feet above the elevation of the adjacent street
or highway, measured at the street or highway center line.
(6) Attached. No off-premises sign or sign face shall be attached in any
way to any other off-premises sign, except that a sign may have two
sign faces of 300 square feet each if they are placed approximately
back-to-back.
(7) Control of lighting and glare: see standards in § 280-37.
(8) Residences. No off-premises sign greater than 30 square feet in
sign area shall be located within 200 feet from a lot line of an
existing dwelling.
(9) Condition. The sign shall be maintained in a good and safe
condition. The area around the sign shall be kept free of debris.

the same lot requires a two-acre lot area, then the lot shall
have a minimum lot area of two acres.
(b) The applicant shall submit a site plan that demonstrates that
each structure would meet the requirements of this article.
(c) The lot may include a condominium form of ownership of
individual buildings, with a legally binding property owners
association, if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Borough Solicitor,
that there will be appropriate legal mechanisms in place and
compliance with applicable state law.

applicable state law.
C. Minimum size of dwellings. Each dwelling unit shall include a minimum
of 500 square feet of enclosed habitable, indoor, heated floor area, and
which shall be primarily above the level of the ground. This minimum
floor area shall be increased to 800 square feet if there are three or
more bedrooms.
A. In general.
(1) No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in such a way
that it would result in another lot, building or use not being able to
meet the requirements of this article. This includes, but is not
limited to, setback areas, nonimpervious areas and off-street

exterior stairways, fire escapes or other required means of
egress, rain leads, chimneys, ground-mounted doors for
basement access, window awnings, chaise for heating pipes or
other similar structures that do not include space usable by
persons may extend or project into a required yard not more
than three feet, except as may be required within a drainage or
utility easement.
(b) Steps, stoops, fire escapes, handicapped ramps, and landings
necessary to provide entrance to a building may be located
within a required setback area. Stoops, fire escapes and
handicapped ramps serving an existing building may extend

approval by the Zoning Officer.
(c) See also exceptions for decks and accessory buildings in the
notes of § 280-26A.
(3) Front yard setback exception. In any district within a block
containing a lot proposed for construction or expansion of a
building, where 50% or more of the improved lots on such block
frontage currently have front yards of less depth than is currently
required for that district, and where the clear majority of such lots
are already developed, the average of such existing front setbacks
shall establish the minimum front yard depth for the remainder of
the frontage.
C. Sight clearance at intersections.
(1) Clear sight triangles shall be provided within which no obstruction
to vision shall be permitted between a height of two to 10 feet
above the center-line grade of each street intersection. Such clear
sight triangles shall be established from the point intersection of
the center lines of the intersecting streets for a distance of 75 feet
where both streets are local streets, 100 feet where one or both

connected by a third longer leg.
(4) Where two alleys intersect, a clear sight triangle shall be
established with each leg of the triangle 10 feet long along the
center line of each alley, and with the two legs connected by a third
longer leg.
§ 280-56 JUNKYARDS § 280-56
170:879
(5) Within these clear sight triangles, no new sight obstruction shall be
allowed that obstructs the views of motorists of oncoming vehicle
and pedestrian traffic at a height between three and 10 feet in
elevation. To the maximum extent feasible, this clear sight triangle
shall also be cleared of existing obstructions, such as by trimming
vegetation.
D. Buffer yards. Buffer yards and screening complying with the following
standards shall be required under the following situations. These buffer
yard standards shall supersede the buffer planting requirements of the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.234
(1) Buffer yard width, when required. Buffer yards shall have a
minimum width of 20 feet, except 10 feet in the DC District and 30
feet in the O, IO and A Districts. Buffer yards shall be required in

Buffer Yard to be Provided by
the Following
When the Use Providing the
Screening and Buffer Is
Along side and rear lot lines of
any new:
Abutting or across an alley from
an existing dwelling within a
residential district, and visible
from such dwelling
(1) Principal commercial or
industrial use;
(2) Area of 10 or more new
off-street parking spaces;
(3) An outdoor industrial
storage area; or
(4) An area routinely used for

two or more tractor-trailer
trucks.
Along the street right-of-way
line or a lot line of any new:
Abutting and visible from a
public street
(1) Outdoor industrial storage
area; or
(2) Area routinely used for the
overnight parking of or
more tractor-trailer trucks.

(a) The buffer yard shall be measured from the district boundary
line, street right-of-way line or lot line, whichever is applicable.
234. Editor's Note: See Ch. 235, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 280-56 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-56
170:880
(b) Plants needed for the visual screen shall not be placed within
an existing street right-of-way. However, deciduous trees may
be permitted by the Borough to be placed within a street rightof-
way.
(c) The buffer yard may include areas within a required front, side
or rear yard, or a paved area setback area provided the larger
yard requirement shall apply in case of overlap.
(3) Characteristics of buffer yards.
(a) The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures,
dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage or display,
manufacturing or processing activity, materials, loading and
unloading areas or vehicle parking or display. Buffer yards
shall primarily include evergreen plants, in addition to any
required shade trees.
(b) As a special exception use, the applicant may prove to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that an alternative
method of screening will satisfactorily avoid conflicts between
uses and provide an attractive appearance. For example, the
Board may approve a decorative brick wall to be placed
between a loading area and an abutting street.
(4) Plant screen.
(a) Each buffer yard shall include a planting screen of trees or
shrubs extending the length of the lot line.
(b) Each planting screen shall meet the following requirements:
[1] Plant materials needed to form the visual screen shall have
a minimum height when planted of three feet. An initial
height of two feet may be used where a parking area is
intended to be visible from a street for security purposes.
In addition, an average of one deciduous shade tree, with a
minimum trunk diameter of two inches measured six
inches above the ground level, shall be placed for each 50
feet of length of the buffer yard. The shade trees may be
clustered or spaced unevenly. Where street trees are
approved and provided in the right-of-way, or healthy
existing trees will be preserved, those trees may serve in
place of this shade tree requirement.
[2] Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be of such
species, spacing and size as can reasonably be expected to
produce within five years a mostly solid year-round visual
screen at least six feet in height.
[3] The plant screen shall be placed so that at maturity the
plants will not obstruct a street or sidewalk.
§ 280-56 JUNKYARDS § 280-56
170:881
§ 280-57. Landscaping.
[4] The plant visual screen shall be interrupted only at:
[a] Approved points of approximately perpendicular
vehicle or pedestrian ingress and egress to the lot;
[b] Locations necessary to comply with safe sight distance
requirements; and
[c] Locations needed to meet other specific state,
Borough and utility requirements.
[5] American arborvitae and similar weak-stem plants shall
not be used to meet the buffer yard requirements. If more
than 20 evergreen plants are proposed, no more than 50%
shall be of one species.
[6] Where space allows, evergreen trees should be planted at
diagonal offsets so that there is room for future growth of
the trees.
(5) Parking lot screening. If six or more new off-street parking spaces
are provided within 30 feet from the right-of-way of North Front
Street, a six-foot-wide planting area shall be provided between the
parking and the street right-of-way. To provide security and
oversight of the parking area from a street, species of plants should
be used that can be trimmed to a height of less than four feet. This
provision shall not apply if a more intense buffer is required under
§ 280-56D(1) above (such as for truck parking).
(6) Buffer yard plans: see § 280-57E.
(7) Fences.
(a) Any fence in a buffer yard shall be placed on the inside of any
required plant screening.
(b) As a condition of any variance or special exception approval,
the Zoning Hearing Board may require the installation of a
fence in addition to a buffer yard. As a condition of any land
development approval, Borough Council may require the
installation of a fence in addition to a buffer yard.
A. Any part of a commercial, industrial, institutional or apartment lot
which is not used for structures, loading areas, parking spaces and
aisles, sidewalks and designated storage areas shall be provided with
an all-season, well-maintained vegetative groundcover, and shall be
landscaped with trees and shrubs. Landscaped areas shall be kept free
of debris, rubbish and noxious weeds.

170:882
C. Parking area trees.
(1) One deciduous tree shall be required for every 10 new off-street
parking spaces.
(2) If a lot will include 20 or more new parking spaces, landscaped
areas shall be provided within the parking area. Otherwise, the
trees may be planted around the parking area.
(3) Trees required by this section shall meet the following standards:
(a) Type of trees permitted. Required trees shall be chosen from
the list of approved large or medium trees in Chapter 245,
Trees, of the Code of the Borough of Catasauqua.
(b) Quality of trees. Required trees shall be of symmetrical growth
and free of insect pests and disease.
(c) Minimum size. The trunk diameter (measured at a height of six
inches above the finished grade level) shall be a minimum of
two inches or greater.
(d) Planting and maintenance. Required trees shall be:
[1] Planted with adequate unpaved surface around each for
water and air; and
[2] Properly protected by curbs, curb stops, distance or other
devices from damage from vehicles.
D. Street trees. As part of the construction of any new street or any new
principal nonresidential building or any new apartment building, street
trees shall be required to be planted. An average of one street tree shall
be planted for every 50 feet of street length. The street trees do not
need to be planted at specific intervals, but may be moved to fit with
utilities, driveways and other features.
(1) The trees shall be in locations approved by the Zoning Officer.
These locations may or may not be within the street right-of-way,
depending upon the circumstances of the site. If the trees are not
located in the right-of-way, they shall be placed within the yard
immediately adjacent to the right-of-way.
(2) New street trees shall not be required where existing healthy street
trees will be preserved and will serve the same purpose.
E. Landscaping maintenance. All shade tree, buffer yard and other
landscaping required by this chapter shall be perpetually maintained by
the property owner. Any landscaping needed to meet an ordinance
requirement that dies, is removed, or is severely damaged shall be
replaced by the current property owner as soon as is practical
considering growing seasons, within a maximum of 150 days.
§ 280-57 JUNKYARDS § 280-57
170:883
§ 280-58. Nonconformities.
F. Review. Where landscaping is required by this article, the applicant
shall submit a site plan showing proposed initial sizes, locations and
species of plantings and locations of any fencing in sufficient detail to
determine compliance with this section. Such landscaping plan should
be provided to the Zoning Officer for approval.
A. Proof and registration of nonconformities. It shall be the responsibility
of, with the burden of proof upon, a party asserting a nonconformity to
provide the evidence that it is lawful. A property owner may request a
written statement of nonconformity from the Zoning Officer after
providing sufficient evidence.
B. Continuation. A lawful nonconforming use, structure or lot as defined
by this article may be continued and may be sold and continued by new
owners. Any expansion of, construction upon or change in use of a
nonconformity shall only occur in conformance with this section.
C. Expansion of or construction upon nonconformities.
(1) Nonconforming structure.
(a) The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to
be reconstructed or expanded provided:
[1] That such action will not increase the severity or amount
of the nonconformity (such as the area of the building
extending into the required yard) or create any new
nonconformity [except as provided by Subsection C(1)(c)
below]; and
[2] That any expanded area will comply with the applicable
setbacks in that district and other requirements of this
article.
(b) In the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a
nonconforming use, any expansion shall also meet the
requirements of this section regarding nonconforming uses.
(c) Extension along a nonconforming setback. If an existing
building has a lawfully nonconforming building setback,
additions may occur to increase the height above such setback
or to extend other portions of the building out to the
nonconforming side or rear setback line, provided that:
[1] The structure shall not be extended beyond the existing
nonconforming setback line;
[2] No additional nonconformity shall be created;
[3] The new nonconforming extension shall not be greater
than 25% of the existing floor area;
§ 280-57 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-58
170:884
[4] All other requirements of this chapter shall be met; and
[5] Such addition shall not be permitted for a nonresidential
building that abuts an existing principal residential use.
(2) Nonconforming lots.
(a) Permitted construction on a nonconforming lot. New permitted
structures for a single permitted-by-right principal use and its
customary accessory uses may be constructed, reconstructed
or expanded on a nonconforming lot of record held in single
and separate ownership as a permitted-by-right use if
minimum setback requirements are met.
(b) Lot width. The fact that an existing lawful lot of record does not
meet the minimum lot width requirements of this article shall
not by itself cause such lot to be considered to be a
nonconforming lot.
(3) Expansion of a nonconforming nonresidential use. A
nonconforming use or a building used by a nonconforming use shall
not be expanded, except in accordance with the following
provisions:
(a) An expansion of more than 5% in total building floor area shall
require special exception approval from the Zoning Hearing
Board under Article I.
(b) Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same
lot that the nonconforming use was located upon at the time
the use became nonconforming.
(c) The total building floor area used by a nonconforming use, or
the total land area covered by the nonconforming use,
whichever is more restrictive, shall not be increased by greater
than 40% beyond what existed in the nonconforming use at the
time the use first became nonconforming, under this chapter or
a previously adopted zoning ordinance, whichever came first.
The above maximum increase shall be measured in aggregate
over the entire life of the nonconformity. All expansions of the
nonconforming use and/or building(s) that occurred since the
use originally became nonconforming shall count towards the
above maximum increase.
(d) Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required
setbacks and other requirements of this article, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance.
(4) Expansion of a nonconforming residential use. An existing
nonconforming residential use may be expanded as a permitted-byright
use provided that:
§ 280-58 JUNKYARDS § 280-58
170:885
(a) The number of dwelling units or rooming house units are not
increased;
(b) The expansion meets all applicable setbacks;
(c) No new types of nonconformities are created;
(d) A nonconformity is not made more severe; and
(e) All other dimensional requirements of this chapter are met.
(5) Nonconforming sign. The provisions of this article shall not be
interpreted to provide a right to expand or extend a nonconforming
sign. Instead, any expansions or extensions of a nonconforming
sign shall comply with this article.
D. Damaged or destroyed nonconformities. A nonconforming structure
that has been destroyed or damaged may be rebuilt in a nonconforming
fashion only if: the application for a building permit is submitted within
18 months after the date of damage or destruction; work begins in
earnest within 12 months afterwards and continues; and no
nonconformity may be created or increased by any reconstruction. The
property shall be properly secured during such time in such a way to
keep out trespassers and to avoid harm to neighboring properties.
E. Abandonment of a nonconformity.
(1) If a nonconforming use of a building or land is discontinued, razed,
removed or abandoned for 12 or more months, subsequent use of
such building or land shall conform with the regulations of the
district in which it is located, except as provided for in the
"damaged or destroyed nonconformities" provisions of this section.
(2) The applicant shall be responsible to provide evidence that the
nonconformity was not abandoned.
(3) An existing lawful separate dwelling unit may be unrented for any
period of time without being considered "abandoned" under this
article.
F. Changes from one nonconforming use to another.
(1) Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land shall not
revert to a nonconforming use.
(2) A nonconforming use may be changed to a different nonconforming
use only if permitted as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing
Board. However, special exception approval is not needed for a
simple change within an existing building from one lawful
nonconforming retail store use to another retail store use or from
one lawful nonconforming personal service use to another personal
service use provided that the new use complies with any Zoning
§ 280-58 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-58
170:886
§ 280-59. Dumpster screening and location.
Hearing Board conditions that applied to the previous use and is
not more objectionable in external effects than the previous use.
(3) Where special exception approval is required for a change of a
nonconforming use, the Board shall determine whether the
applicant has provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed
new use will be equal or less objectionable in external effects than
the preexisting nonconforming use with regard to:
(a) Traffic safety and generation (especially truck traffic);
(b) Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire,
hazardous substances, and explosive hazards;
(c) Amount and character of outdoor storage;
(d) Late night and early morning hours of operation if the use
would be close to dwellings; and
(e) Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
(4) A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a nonconforming
adult use.
G. District changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become
nonconforming because of a zoning district change shall be regulated
under this section on nonconformities.
A. Any newly placed solid waste dumpster shall be screened on all sides as
necessary to screen views from public streets and dwellings. Such
screening shall consist of decorative masonry walls, mostly solid
weather-resistant wood fencing or fencing of a similar appearance
(such as white vinyl vertical planks). Primarily evergreen plantings are
also encouraged in addition to the fence or wall. The fence or wall shall
include a self-latching door or gate.
B. Setback from dwellings. An outdoor solid waste container with a
capacity of over 25 cubic feet shall be kept the maximum distance that
is feasible from any abutting dwelling, in the determination of the
Zoning Officer, provided that the container is not in the minimum front
yard. In any case, an outdoor solid waste container shall be kept a
minimum of 15 feet from an abutting dwelling. A solid waste dumpster
shall not be located in a front yard.
C. If a solid waste dumpster is moved from one part of a lot to another part
of a lot, then it shall come into compliance with this § 280-59.
D. All waste containers shall be completely enclosed, and the lid shall be
kept in place. The locations of all dumpsters shall be shown on all site
plans and land development plans submitted to the Borough.
§ 280-58 JUNKYARDS § 280-59
170:887
E. This section shall not apply to dumpsters temporarily placed during
actual construction or demolition on the premises, or for recycling
containers that do not involve garbage.

§ 280-62. Airport surface zones.
In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created
and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath
the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical
surfaces. Such zones are shown on the ABE Airport Height Limitation and
Zoning District Map prepared by the PA Department of Transportation,
Bureau of Aviation, and dated Spring 1989, which is hereby included by
reference and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one of the
following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive
height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as
follows:
A. Utility runway visual approach surface zone. Established beneath the
visual approach surface. The inner edge of this zone coincides with the
width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The zone expands
outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation
of the center line of the runway.
B. Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach surface zone.
Established beneath the nonprecision instrument approach surface.
The inner edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary
surface and is 500 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary
surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line of the
runway.
C. Runway larger than utility visual approach surface zone. Established
beneath the visual approach surface. The inner edge of this zone
coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide.
The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center
line is the continuation of the center line of the runway.
D. Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than 3/4
mile nonprecision instrument approach surface zone. Established
beneath the nonprecision instrument approach surface. The inner edge
of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500
feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet
at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
center line is the continuation of the center line of the runway.
E. Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as 3/4 mile
nonprecision instrument approach surface zone. Established beneath
the nonprecision instrument approach surface. The inner edge of this
zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet
wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a

§ 280-63. Airport surface zone height limitations.
Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be erected,
altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone
created by this article to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are
hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:
F. Precision instrument runway approach surface zone. Established
beneath the precision instrument approach surface. The inner edge of
this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000
feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000
feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
center line is the continuation of the center line of the runway.
G. Transitional surface zones. Established beneath the transitional
surfaces adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on
the Height Limitation and Zoning District Map.
H. Horizontal surface zone. Established beneath the horizontal surface,
150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which
is constructed by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for visual or utility
runways and 1,000 feet radii for all other runways from the center of
each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the
adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal
surface zone does not include the approach surface and transitional
surface zones.
I. Conical surface zone. Established beneath the conical surface. This
zone commences at the periphery of the horizontal surface and extends
outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
A. Utility runway visual approach surface zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as
the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet
along the extended runway center line.
B. Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach surface zone. Slopes
20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway center line.

§ 280-62 JUNKYARDS § 280-63
170:893
§ 280-64. Airport zoning requirements.
E. Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as 3/4 mile
nonprecision instrument approach surface zone. Slopes 34 feet outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000
feet along the extended runway center line.
F. Precision instrument runway approach surface zone. Slopes 50 feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance
of 10,000 feet along the extended runway center line; thence slopes
upward 40 feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional
horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway center
line.
G. Transitional surface zones. Slopes seven feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of
150 feet above the airport elevation which is 394 feet above mean sea
level. In addition to the foregoing when an airport has a precision
instrument runway approach zone, there are established height limits
sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides
of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to
where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision
instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone,
there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet
measured at 90° angles to the extended runway center line.
H. Horizontal surface zone. Established at 150 feet above the established
airport elevation or at a height of 544 feet above mean sea level.
I. Conical surface zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface and at 150 feet
above the established airport elevation and extending to a height of 350
feet above the established airport elevation or at a height of 744 feet
above mean sea level.
J. Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this article shall be construed
as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or
growth of any tree to a height up to 45 feet above the surface of the
land.
A. Reasonableness. All airport zoning regulations adopted under this
article shall be reasonable; none shall impose any requirement or
restriction unless it is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of
this article. In determining what regulations it may adopt, the Borough
shall consider, among other factors, the character of the flying
operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the
§ 280-63 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-64
170:894
§ 280-65. Airport approach permits and variances.
terrain within the airport hazard area, the character of the
neighborhood and the uses to which the property to be zoned is put and
adaptable.
B. Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article,
no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this
article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and
aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair
visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or
otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
C. Nonconforming uses:
(1) Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or
other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming
to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming
use, except as provided in § 280-65 (relating to permits and
variances). Nothing contained herein shall require any change in
the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective
date of this article, and is diligently executed.
(2) Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or
tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and
maintenance thereon or nearby of such markers and lights as shall
be deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer acting in response to a
written recommendation by the Lehigh Valley International Airport
(LVIA) staff to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of
the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers
and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the
expense of LVIA. The Borough of Catasauqua shall not accept
responsibility to install, maintain, inspect or fund markers and
lights.
A. Future use. Except as specifically provided in Subsection A(1), (2) or (3)
hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have
been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use,
structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If
such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No
§ 280-64 JUNKYARDS § 280-65
170:895
permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall
be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with
§ 280-65E and Article I.
(1) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical
zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because
of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such
zones.
(2) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the
runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree
or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such approach zones.
(3) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall be required
for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above
the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain,
land contour or topographic feature, would extend above the height
limit prescribed for such transition zones.
B. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed
as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of
any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this article, except that no permit is required to make
maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of existing structures which
do not enlarge or increase the height of an existing structure.
C. Existing uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or rebuilt or nonconforming tree allowed to grow
higher or replanted, a permit must be secured from the Borough
authorizing the replacement or change. No permit shall be granted that
would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a
nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date of this article or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is
made.
D. Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or
tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from this
article.
E. Variance.
§ 280-65 CATASAUQUA CODE § 280-65
170:896
§ 280-66. Enforcement; notification of variance.
(1) Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of
any structure or permit the growth of any object of natural growth
or otherwise use his property in violation of airport zoning
regulations may apply to the Zoning Hearing Board for a variance
from the zoning regulations in question. A variance shall only be
granted after the requirements of § 280-66 are satisfied. A variance
may be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public
interest but would do substantial justice and would be in
accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this article. Any
variance may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions that
the Zoning Hearing Board may deem necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this article.
(2) The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the
effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Additionally, no
application for variance to the requirements of this article may be
considered by the Zoning Hearing Board unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the Airport Manager (or person
of equivalent description) for advice as to the aeronautical effects
of the variance. If the Airport Manager (or person of equivalent
description) does not respond to the application within 15 days
after receipt, the Zoning Hearing Board may act without such input
to grant or deny said application.
F. Hazard marking and lighting. In granting any permit or variance under
this section, the Zoning Hearing Board shall, if it deems the action
advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and reasonable under
the circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to require the

A. In any case in which it is desired to remove, lower or otherwise
terminate a nonconforming structure or use, or the approach protection

with respect to the height of structures or trees, and the use of land, or
any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall
govern and prevail.

standards applicable to the use when the applicant complies with
§ 280-82K.
(5) Note 5: Enhanced lot area calculation. For the purpose of density
calculations only, an applicant shall be permitted to include land in
the municipal complex tract in its calculation of lot area applicable
to the development tract or any portion thereof. The amount of
municipal complex tract land to be included in the enhanced lot

170:913
§ 280-79. Dimensional standards.
§ 280-80. Unified development standards.
area calculation shall be in the same proportion as the applicant's
land is to the development tract. By way of example, if the
applicant's land to be developed represents 50% of the total
amount of land in the development tract, then the applicant's lot
area may be enhanced by including 50% of the land in the
municipal complex tract. This note shall apply only to the initial
development of the land in the development tract. If development
tract land is developed and the lot area enhancement is not used,
it shall not be available for other development in the development
tract or to subsequent applicants without the approval of Borough
Council, which may impose conditions on such use.
A. Minimum setback for private roads, parking aisles, parking spaces and
access driveways shall be 10 feet from adjacent residential zoning
districts and zero feet from adjacent nonresidential zoning districts.

shall be 45 feet; provided, however, that the building height may be
increased up to 75 feet if the building is set back at least 100 feet from a
public street existing at the time of preliminary plan submission that
has 200 feet of frontage.
C. The maximum perimeter setback from every development tract
property line along a public street shall be 10 feet for parking
structures and 10 feet for all nonparking structures. The foregoing
setback may be enlarged for a nonparking structure where the
extended area is necessary to accommodate a use which is integral, or
accessory, to the permitted use and such use would otherwise interfere
with the functioning of the sidewalk or the pedestrian right-of-way, such
as an area to accommodate outdoor seating for a restaurant.
D. Maximum impervious surface coverage for the entire Waterfront
District: 80%.
E. Maximum building coverage for the entire Waterfront District: 65%.

shall be interrelated and interconnected.
B. The applicant may subdivide the tract in order to create separate
leaseholds, boundaries for mortgages or other purposes, provided such
subdivision is shown in a recorded subdivision plan. The above
notwithstanding, the laying out, proposal, design or construction of
public or private streets shall not in and of itself create a lot or
subdivision within a mixed use development authorized hereunder, and
the intent to subdivide shall be clearly depicted on the recorded
subdivision plan. [Amended 11-5-2018 by Ord. No. 1375]
C. All development shall be coordinated with all existing and proposed
development in the district and existing and proposed infrastructure so
that the district may generally develop harmoniously as a whole and
within the Borough. Coordination shall be required with respect to
streets, interior and exterior, whether public or private, and with
intersections, sidewalks, crosswalks, curbing, waterlines, sanitary
sewers, stormwater BMPs, park and recreation land, open space, and
other infrastructure and utilities.
