CODE OF THE CITY OF CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA 
____________ 
Published in 1985 by Order of the City Council 
____________ 
 
PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Charleston of a general and permanent nature, and is the first codification since 1975. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth section of Chapter 5 is 5-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 7-4 and 7-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 7-4.1, 7-4.2 and 7-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Sec. 1-13. - Parenthetical and reference matter.

Reference matter not in parentheses is for information only and is not a part of this Code.  
Sec. 1-14. - Effect of repeal or expiration of ordinance. 
The repeal of an ordinance, or its expiration by virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued, any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred or any proceeding commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired. When an ordinance which repealed another shall itself be repealed, the previous ordinance shall not be revived without express words to that effect. 
(Code 1975, § 1-10)

(b)  Any officer, agent or other person acting for or employed by any corporation or unincorporated association or organization, shall be subject and liable to punishment as well as such corporation or unincorporated association or organization for the violation by it of any provision of this Code, where such violation was the act or omission, or the result of the act, omission or order of any such person.  
Sec. 1-16. - General penalty; continuing violations. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or any section thereof no penalty is specifically provided for the violation of such Code or section, the court before whom an offender shall be tried may sentence him to pay a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or serve a term not exceeding thirty (30) days in jail, or both. Each day any violation of this Code or section thereof shall continue shall, unless otherwise specifically provided, constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  Whenever a person is accused of committing an act which is susceptible of being designated as several different offenses, the judge of the municipal court, upon the trial of such person, shall be required to elect which charge to prefer and a conviction or an acquittal upon such elected charge shall be a complete bar to further prosecution for the alleged offense.

It is hereby declared to be the intention of the council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional or invalid by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code, since the same would have been enacted by the council without the incorporation in this Code of any such unconstitutional or invalid phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.

Any person or entity violating any provision of the Code of the City of Charleston, or any code adopted pursuant thereto, within the corporate limits of the City of Charleston, may be issued a uniform ordinance summons.

Sec. 2-87. - Employment procedures. 
City employees shall be employed in accordance with the current classification and compensation plan of the city and with the approval of the mayor; provided, however, that the mayor is empowered in any emergency or for increased efficiency in government to refrain from filling any vacancy in any department or division, or to transfer any individual on the payroll from one department or division to another; provided, however, the mayor may delegate this authority as he may deem appropriate.

(Ord. No. 1999-75, § 1, 5-18-99)  
Sec. 2-90. - Selective Service System registration. 
(a)  Findings. Federal law requires all male citizens and all male immigrant non-citizens living in the United States to register with the Selective Service System upon the attainment of eighteen (18) years of age. While the all-volunteer military force policy has proven successful, registration with the Selective Service System remains a vital component of national security strategy. Should a draft be required in the future, such draft must be as fair as possible, and fairness dictates that all eligible persons be appropriately registered with the Selective Service System. Further, registration with the Selective Service System has value as it is a prerequisite for federal student aid, job training, government employment and U.S. citizenship. City council has determined it to be fair, reasonable and in furtherance of federal policy to require, as a condition of employment, that any male job applicant between the ages of eighteen (18) and twenty-six (26) provide proof of registration with the Selective Service System or appropriate deferment credentials. 
(b)  From and after the effective date hereof [Oct. 24, 2000], every male between the ages of eighteen (18) and twenty-six (26) who seeks employment with the City of Charleston shall submit documentation evidencing registration with the Selective Service System or documentation evidencing exemption from such registration.

Sec. 2-268. - Plan for the utilization of minority business enterprises (MBEs) and women business enterprises (WBEs). 
(a)  City council finds and declares it to be in furtherance of sound procurement practices that all business entities be accorded a real and equitable opportunity to participate in city procurements. City council further finds that it is in the best interests of the city and its residents that a program be developed to ensure that businesses owned and controlled by minorities and women have a real opportunity to compete for city purchases to provide for a balanced and healthy economy and to foster open and competitive procurement within the city. 
(b)  There is hereby established a plan for the utilization of minority business enterprises (MBE) and women business enterprises (WBE), which plan shall be administered by the manager of the office of minority business enterprise (hereinafter the "manager") in conjunction with the director of procurement or by such other individual(s) as the mayor may, from time to time, appoint. It shall be the responsibility of the manager to formulate and publish the necessary rules, guidelines and to implement this plan, including but not limited to rules and regulations regarding the certification of MBEs and WBEs so as to ensure that the benefits of this plan inure to businesses owned and controlled by minorities and women, provided however, that such rules and regulations shall be submitted to city council for approval. The manager shall also be charged with compiling, updating and distributing a directory of available MBEs and WBEs for use by city personnel in achieving the goals of this plan, and further, shall formulate and publish guidelines to be utilized by the city in assessing whether a procurement qualifies as a MBE or WBE procurement. Further, the manager shall compile data regarding the level of participation in city procurements by MBEs and WBEs and present them to council for analysis of the program. 
(c)  As utilized herein, the following terms shall have the meaning as designated, to wit: 
(1)  Controllable dollars means funds other than those budgeted for salaries of employees, fringe benefits, utility expenses, rents, taxes and any items which may be procured only from special identified sources. 
(2)  Construction means the process of building, altering, repairing, improving or demolishing any public structure, building or roadway, or any other improvement of any kind to any public real property.

(3)  A minority business enterprise (MBE) is a business concern which: (a) is at least fifty-one (51) percent owned by one (1) or more minority individuals, or in the case of the publicly owned business, at least fifty-one (51) percent of the stock of which is owned by one (1) or more minority individuals; and (b) the management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one (1) or more of the minority individuals who own it. 
(4)  An emergency purchase is a procurement undertaken from a sole source where circumstances require an immediate procurement to protect the physical well-being of the public or of any city employee, or where the appropriate and efficient functioning of government is threatened without such purchase. 
(5)  Procurement means buying, purchasing, renting, leasing or otherwise acquiring any supplies, services or construction. 
(6)  Services means furnishing of labor, time or effort by one who is not under the regular employ of the city. This term includes "professional services," but does not include employment agreements or collective bargaining agreements.

(9)  A women business enterprise (WBE) is a business concern (1) which is at least fifty-one (51) percent owned by women, or in the case of any publicly owned business, at least fifty-one (51) percent of the stock is owned by women, and (2) the daily management and business operations of which are controlled by women. 
(d)  On an annual basis, the mayor shall recommend to the city council for its approval program goals, targeting the percentage of city procurements sought to be awarded to MBEs and WBEs during a given fiscal year; provided however, that minimum goals for participation by MBEs and WBEs in procurements obtained with controllable dollars are hereby established, if the same can be justified on an annual basis as being fiscally responsible and feasible, to wit: 
     Combined 
     MBE/WBE 
(1)  Construction .....20% 
(2)  Services .....20% 
(3)  Supplies .....12% 
Methodology used in establishing such goal(s) on a year to year basis shall include a projection of the number and type of procurements to be made by the city during such fiscal year, a projection of the number and type of MBEs and WBEs certified to compete for such procurements and the experience of the city in attaining, or failing to attain, previous MBEs and WBE goals in light of the reasons for attaining or not attaining such goals. 
(e)  (1)  In any procurements sought through public advertisement other than construction procurements, the procurement director, in conjunction with the mayor and the manager of minority business enterprise, shall determine the combined percentage of the procurement, if any, that the bidder should attempt to allocate to MBEs and or WBEs, and shall cause this determination to be set forth in the bid specifications along with the necessary directions to the bidder for compliance with such goals. In setting a particular procurement goal, consideration shall be given to such factors as the ability of the procurement to be broken down into component parts which would allow for contracting and procurement opportunities to MBEs and WBEs and resources available from known MBEs and or WBEs. 
(2)  In construction procurements sought through public advertisement, the minimum construction goals as set forth in subsection (d) shall be incorporated into bid specifications utilizing the city's Good Faith Effort Program unless the manager of minority business enterprise certifies to the mayor and the procurement division that the nature or size of the procurement does not lend itself to being feasibly broken down into component parts that would allow for MBEs and or WBE subcontracting opportunities. 
(3)  In all other procurements, except emergency procurements, it shall be the responsibility of the procurement director to make affirmative efforts to ensure that MBEs and WBEs are provided an equal opportunity to compete for, or participate in city procurements.

Editor's note— Formerly numbered as § 2-267.  
Sec. 2-269. - Touring fee. 
(a)  Findings. City council finds and declares that visitors to the city utilizing the public streets and sidewalks for purposes of touring constitute a viable component to the economic well being of the city. At the same time, the influx of visitors touring the city on public streets and sidewalks has necessitated that certain regulations be put in place to balance the needs and comfort of the visitors with those of residents. These regulations include the implementation of a tourist management program, the implementation of regulations governing the use of streets by tourist operations and the employment of personnel to secure the safety, comfort and well being of visitors, all of which has burdened the general fund of the city, and but for which the same would not be required to the extent necessary. City council finds it to be in the interest of the public and in furtherance of the general welfare that a reasonable fee be imposed upon those touring the city via public streets and sidewalks to assure a means by which the city and its environs may be enjoyed by the touring public in a safe, clean and efficient manner, without undue burden on the general public. The purpose of this section is established a mechanism by which certain funds may be collected from those participating in tours conducted on public streets and sidewalks to assist in the costs of providing those services which make the City of Charleston such a desirable place to visit. 
(b)  There is hereby imposed a fee of fifty cents ($0.50) on every ticket or admission to a tour conducted on the public streets and sidewalks of the City of Charleston. 
(c)  Each tour operator shall collect the fee imposed by this section from any patron when he or she pays the admission charge. Every tour operator shall hold the fee imposed by this section in trust until the same is paid to the director as herein after provided. For purposes hereof, "tour operator" shall mean the entity or individual which or who possesses a business license to conduct tours in the City of Charleston or which or who sponsors tours conducted on the streets or sidewalks of the city, and "tour" means the conduct of a sightseeing venture, for hire, in the city from the streets and/or sidewalks of the city, unless exempt by the provisions of subsection (g) hereof. 
(d)  Prior to conducting, operating or maintaining any tour on the public streets and sidewalks of the city, which is subject to this section, each tour operator shall register with the director of revenue collections and obtain a tourism fee collection certificate. The certificate shall include, among other things, the name of the tour operator, the permanent address of the tour operator, the date upon which the certificate was issued and the statement that by obtaining a certificate, the operator agrees to collect the touring fee for the city and to comply with the city's rules and regulations for the collection of the fees. No tourism fee collection certificate may be transferred or assigned without permission of the director of business license, nor may the controlling interest in a corporation which holds a collection certificate be sold or assigned without such permission. 
(e)  Each operator shall, on the date or within the time period hereinafter prescribed, make a return to the director of revenue collections on forms provided by the director of the total number of tours conducted and the total number of tickets sold or distributed and the amount of fees collected from the patrons. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of any touring fees shall be remitted to the director. Tourism fees and required reports shall be remitted to the director of revenue collections on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month and shall include all fees collected the previous month. If the due date for reporting and payment falls on a Saturday or Sunday, or a federal, state, or City of Charleston observed holiday then reporting and payment are considered timely on the following business day. Furthermore, if the due date for reporting and payment falls during the period of a natural disaster which directly precluded the responsible party from timely submitting the reports and payments, an additional ten (10) day extension may be granted upon written request by the taxpayer to the director of the revenue collections division. A natural disaster is defined as a hurricane, earthquake, flood, or tornado. The responsible party is considered directly precluded from timely submitting reports and payments if their offices are deemed by emergency officials to be damaged to the extent of being unsafe or unavailable for use due to the disaster or postal service to the immediate area is suspended during the due date. Operators who averaged less than six hundred dollars ($600.00) annually in tourism fees over the previous twelve-month period are allowed to file on a quarterly basis with the required reports and fees due on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the following month after the quarter. The quarters are defined as January—March, April—June, July—September, and October— December. New operators are required to file monthly until a twelve-month history of tour fee filings has occurred. The failure of a tour operator to collect from patrons the fee imposed by this section shall not relieve the operator from making the required remittance to the director of revenue collections. 
(f)  There is hereby established a special account, to be known as the touring fee account, into which all monies remitted to the city under this section shall be deposited. Any and all funds in the touring fee account, including any interest as may accrue thereon, shall be used only for the purpose of offsetting, to the extent possible, the costs to the city in providing tourism management services, including but not limited to, costs necessary to provide safe travel to the touring public along streets and sidewalks, costs necessary to assure a clean and inviting appearance to the touring public, costs necessary to implement, manage and oversee the tourism industry within the city and any such other costs as may be reasonably incurred in providing for the safety, comfort and well being of tourists on the public streets and sidewalks. 
(g)  The fee imposed by this section shall not apply to tours comprised of children under the age of eighteen (18) who tour the city as part of a school or organized group activity or to tours conducted in vehicles described in section 29-173 of the Code of the City of Charleston. 
(h)  Failure to file the required reports and fees as required by this section will subject the operator to a ten dollar ($10.00) penalty or a penalty of ten (10) percent of the tourism fee due, whichever is higher. The failure of a tour operator to remit to the city the fees required by this section, as and when due, shall constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment for up to thirty (30) days, or both. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any misrepresentation of the information required by returns as set forth in subsection (e) hereof, shall subject the town operator to suspension and/a revocation of his business license and/or tour guide certificate as may be determined, after a hearing, by the business license committee. At least ten (10) days' notice of any such hearing shall be provided by the director of revenue collections to the applicable tour operator. 
(i)  If any provision of this section or application thereof to any circumstance is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions of this section or applications of this section which can be given effect without the unvalid provisions or applications, and to this end the provisions and applications of this section are severable.

(b)  Payment of municipal hospitality tax. The tax imposed by this section shall be collected from any patron when he tenders payment for his meal, food, or beverage and shall be held in trust for the benefit of the city until the same is paid to the director of the revenue collections division as hereinafter provided. Every establishment subject to this section shall, on the date or within the time period hereinafter prescribed, make a return to the revenue collections division of the city on forms provided by the office delineating gross proceeds of sales of prepared meals, food, and beverages for the previous month, and the amount of any tax due by virtue of this section. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of any tax due hereunder shall be remitted. Taxes and required reports shall be submitted to the Revenue Collections Division by the twentieth (20) day of the month and shall cover sales of the previous month. If the due date for reporting and payment falls on a Saturday or Sunday, or a federal, state, or City of Charleston observed holiday then reporting and payment are considered timely on the following business day. Furthermore, if the due date for reporting and payment falls during the period of a natural disaster which directly precluded the responsible party from timely submitting the reports and payments, an additional ten (10) day extension may be granted upon written request by the taxpayer to the director of the revenue collections division. A natural disaster is defined as a hurricane, earthquake, flood, or tornado. The responsible party is considered directly precluded from timely submitting reports and payments if their offices are deemed by emergency officials to be damaged to the extent of being unsafe or unavailable for use due to the disaster or postal service to the immediate area is suspended during the due date. Any taxes not timely remitted shall be subject to a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent. The failure to collect from patrons the tax imposed by this section shall not relieve any establishment subject to this section from making the required remittance. 
(c)  Hospitality tax account. There is hereby established a special account, to be known as the hospitality tax account, into which all monies remitted to the city under this section shall be deposited. Any and all funds in the hospitality tax account, including any interest as may accrue thereon, shall be used only for the purposes as set forth in S.C. Code Ann.

It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to fail or refuse to make available the necessary books and records during normal business hours upon twenty-four (24) hours' written notice. In the event an audit reveals that false information has been filed by the remitter, the cost of the audit shall be added to the correct amount of fees determined to be due. The director of the revenue collections division or other authorized agent may make systematic inspections of all establishments within the city to ensure compliance with this section. The director of the revenue collections division shall administer the provisions of this section and make reasonable regulations relating to its administration.

(Supp. 2001), the South Carolina Development Impact Fee Act (Act), authorizes the imposition of impact fees to fund the cost of system improvements to public facilities that are necessitated by new growth and development. The Act requires, as a condition precedent to the imposition of impact fees, that the city must have in place a comprehensive plan as set forth in Chapter 29 of Title 6 of the South Carolina Code and otherwise comply with the Act. The city has adopted a comprehensive plan in accordance with Chapter 29 or Title 6 of the South Carolina Code, and in accordance with the Act, has made available to the planning commission assistance to enable it to study and review the issue of impact fees. The planning commission has recommended that impact fees be imposed to fund certain capital improvements that are necessitated by new growth and development, and city council deems it in the interest of the public that such recommendation be adopted and enacted as law.

(3)  Annual report and termination of fees. The city shall prepare and publish an annual report describing the amount of impact fees collected, appropriated or spent during the preceding year. The public safety impact fees provided for herein shall terminate when sufficient funds to pay for the system improvements identified in Part 3, Section E-1 of the Charleston Century V City Plan to be paid for through the use of impact fees have been collected or December 31, 2015, whichever shall first occur. The environmental service impact fees provided for herein shall terminate on May 19, 2015. 
(4)  Impact fees. 
a.  In environmental service impact fee is set at eighty-two dollars ($82.00) per residential dwelling unit, and eighty-two ($82.00) per city container used by nonresidential development. The fee shall be adjusted on an annual basis through the year 2015 based on the Consumer Price Index. 
The fee was calculated using the whole of the city as the service area, maintaining the current, acceptable level of service of once a week pickup over four (4) days, the number of units served by an average truck route, the estimated number of users to be added to the system through the year 2015 and the number and costs of new trucks that will be needed to serve those units. Cost estimates were based on city departmental experience. 
The improvements to be purchased with the environmental impact fees are seven trucks, to be acquired as the number of new units necessitating an additional route come on line, anticipated to be one truck in 2004, one truck in 2005, one truck in 2006, one truck in 2008, one truck in 2010, one truck in 2012 and one truck in 2014. 
b.  A public safety impact fee is set at seventy-nine dollars ($79.00), per dwelling unit and four cents ($0.04) per square foot of nonresidential development. The fee shall be adjusted on an annual basis through the year 2015 based on the Consumer Price Index. Cost estimates were based on city departmental experience. 
The fees were calculated using the whole of the city as the service area, maintaining the current, acceptable level of service of one (1) equipped fire station within five (5) miles of a potential call and one police substation per twenty thousand (20,000) people or per geographically distinct area of the city. Applying these criteria to anticipated growth through the year 2015 demonstrated that new public safety facilities to serve the growth would be required. The type and amount of growth was estimated on the basis of land use assumptions, including zoning, building permit and census data. The cost of public safety facilities and equipment was apportioned between residential sixty-two (62) percent and nonresidential thirty-eight (38) percent, based on departmental experience as to the source and frequency of service calls. A cost per dwelling unit was derived by dividing sixty-two (62) percent of the costs of facility improvements by the estimated number of residential units to be in the city through the year 2015. A cost per square foot of nonresidential development was derived by dividing thirty-eight (38) percent of the costs of facility improvements by the estimated number of nonresidential square footage to be in the city through the year 2015. 
System improvements to be made with the public safety impact fees are a fire station and police team station for the Bees Ferry area, and a pumper truck and a ladder truck, with an estimated completion date of 2006; a fire station and police team station for the Daniel Island area, and a pumper truck and a portion of the cost of a ladder truck, with an estimated completion date of 2004; and a fire station and police substation for the Cainhoy area, and a pumper truck and a portion of the cost of a ladder truck, with an estimated completion date of 2007. 
c.  The payment of a development's proportionate share of system improvement costs by payment of the impact fees as set forth herein constitutes full and complete payment of the new development's proportionate share of those system improvements costs; 
d.  An impact fee payer: 
1.  May negotiate and contract with the city to provide facilities or services, in lieu of the impact fees; 
2.  Has the right of appeal, as hereafter set forth; 
3.  Shall not be required to pay any impact fee until the issuance of the building permit or development permit when no building permit is required. 
(5)  Exemptions from impact fees. Any claim for exemption from an impact fee must be made no later than when the applicant applies for the first building permit, or development permit if no building permit is sought, for the proposed development that creates the obligation to pay the fees. Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, only the following development shall be exempt from payment of impact fees: 
a.  Rebuilding the same amount of floor space of a structure that was destroyed by fire or other catastrophe; 
b.  Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not result in an increase in the number of service units; 
c.  Replacing a residential unit, including a manufactured home, with another residential unit on the same lot, if the number of service units does not increase; 
d.  Placing a construction trailer or office on a lot during the period of construction on the lot; 
e.  Constructing an addition on a residential structure which does not increase the number of service units; 
f.  Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses, such as a tennis court or a clubhouse, unless it is demonstrated clearly that the use creates a significant impact on the system's capacity; 
g.  The residential units in a development project if: 
1.  The development project creates affordable housing units; and 
2.  The impact fee for the residential affordable housing units is funded through a revenue source other than impact fees; and 
3.  If the revenue source to fund the fees is provided by the city, the developer has consented to submit the development to the program established to monitor creating and maintaining affordable housing, as hereafter set forth. 
h.  A development that does not utilize the service for which the impact fee was imposed, provided however, the fee shall be imposed should the development subsequently utilize the service.

DIVISION 1. - FINDINGS 
 
Sec. 17-91. - Findings. 
The streets of the peninsula area of the city, south of Carolina Street, are the traditional city center where major institutional uses are located, where professional, retail and tourism commerce is conducted and where the city's oldest and most significant architecture is located. 
The revitalization of this area of the city has taken hold and continues, as evidenced, in recent years, by the addition of lodging, restaurant and related hospitality uses, new office and retail complexes and the expansion of the technology-based digital corridor. Successful revitalization has resulted in an infusion of people in this area of the city, both during and after normal business hours. 
Some four (4) million tourists now visit the city on an annual basis. The vast majority of these visitors frequent the peninsula area of the city, particularly the King and Market Street shopping districts and the peninsula neighborhoods graced with grand architecture. 
The built environment and development pattern of the peninsula area of the city is old, and established. The streets and sidewalks in this area of the city are narrow and are often crowded. The structures in this area of the city are typically sited at the front property line, leaving little, if any, space to accommodate outdoor vending or performing on private property, thus placing further demands on the sidewalks and other public spaces on the peninsula for these purposes. 
A diversity of uses in the peninsula area of the city is critical to maintaining its vibrancy and its desirability as a place to work, live and recreate. It is vital that the streets, sidewalks and other public places in the peninsula area of the city be able to accommodate varied uses by pedestrian and vehicular traffic. It is in the interests of the public health, safety and welfare that reasonable measures be enacted to maintain safety and accommodate a free flow and exchange of ideas and goods along and on the streets, sidewalks and other public places in the peninsula area of the city.

The criteria shall be nondiscriminatory among distributors, but may make reasonable limitations on the number of publications that any one distributor, publisher or its affiliates, may have at any one location when spaces at that location are limited in number. The city may also implement reasonable regulations to promote the full utilization of spaces and to require the forfeiture of spaces when they are not fully utilized.

In determining design requirements, the city shall consider compatibility of design features with prevailing facade treatments and with streetscape improvements to the full extent newsracks having such features are reasonably available on the market. 
(11)  Each newsrack shall be maintained in a neat and clean condition and in good repair at all times. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each newsrack shall be serviced and maintained so that:

(13)  During the three (3) months after the ratification of this article, nine (9) of the thirty-three (33) locations where newsracks currently exist shall be disassembled and permanently removed by the city or its designee.

In cases where immediate removal of the newsrack is necessary to protect the health or safety of the public, the city may remove or relocate the newsrack at the distributor's expense and promptly give written notice to the distributor at the address identified on the newsrack of such removal or relocation thereafter. In all other cases, the city shall cause a notice to be placed upon the newsrack, or shall give written notice to the distributor at the address identified on the newsrack, stating that the newsrack must be removed or relocated within ten (10) days of the date of the notice and the reason for the removal or relocation.

ARTICLE VIII. - LATE NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 
 
Sec. 17-124. - Findings. 
Successful communities are those that provide desirable atmospheres for living, working and recreating. To foster strong neighborhoods and a healthy economy, it is vital that a balance between these sometimes competing interests be achieved and maintained. Viable, well-managed nightlife activities are crucial elements to the success of the city, as they provide needed recreational opportunities to visitors and residents alike. The hospitality industry is of particular importance to the city's tourist economy, and it is imperative that this industry be conducted in a manner that fosters safe, inviting entertainment so that the city remains attractive to first-time, and returning, visitors. In recent years, the number of establishments that offer on-premises consumption of beer, wine and alcoholic beverages in the early morning hours has increased. These establishments, often in close proximity to one another, provide natural places for gathering and frivolity. Due to their hours of operation, the entertainment they provide and their numbers of patrons coming and going, these establishments often generate noise, litter, traffic and other deleterious effects which disturb the peace, quietude and good order of the community and impose unnecessary burdens on public safety officers. City council finds it in the interests of public safety and good order in the community that reasonable measures be enacted to require that establishments open after midnight and which allow for the on-premises consumption of beer, wine or alcohol, outside the confines of a structure that offers accommodations, demonstrate a willingness and ability to responsibly conduct their business and monitor the activities of their patrons. 
(Ord. No. 2013-55, § 1, 5-28-13)  
Sec. 17-125. - Definitions. 
Door person means a person who is present at all times at the entrance door of a late night entertainment establishment to monitor the number of persons entering the business for compliance with its maximum occupancy load and to check the identifications of persons, if authorized by the business. 
Late night entertainment establishment means a business in existence as of July 1, 2013 that: 
(a)  Is not located in a structure that provides accommodations as that term is used in section 54-120 of the Zoning Ordinance, as the same may from time to time be amended; 
(b)  Is open after midnight; 
(c)  Is licensed to allow on-premises consumption of beer, wine or alcohol; and 
(d)  Is required to have a Class 7(a) business license. 
A business that comes into existence on or after July 1, 2013 which meets the requirements of subsections (a), (b) and (c) shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection 17-126(b) during its first business license year; provided that every one hundred twenty (120) days, beginning on the date the establishment opens for business, the establishment shall submit a report to the city business license division that separately reports the percentage of gross revenues derived from the sale of food and other items from the percentage of gross revenues derived from the sale of beer, wine and/or alcoholic beverages. If for any reporting period, the percentage of gross sales from the sale of beer, wine and/or alcohol is thirty-five (35) percent or more of the gross sales of the establishment, the establishment shall be subject to subsection 17-126(b). This reporting requirement ends when the establishment renews it business license. 
Nothing in this definition shall be deemed to be inconsistent with the provisions of the city's business license ordinance, including but not limited to the schedule of license fees. 
Maximum occupant load means the maximum number of people allowed in a late night entertainment establishment pursuant to the International Fire Code or other fire code in effect in the city, all as the same may, from time to time, be amended. 
Off-site areas used for parking means: 
(1)  Parking spaces or areas not located on the lot of record of the late night entertainment establishment; and 
(2)  Shared parking areas on the lots of record of the late night entertainment establishment, either of which are made available by the late night entertainment establishment to its personnel and patrons for parking. 
Security person means a person who monitors the entrance and other areas of the late night entertainment establishment for purposes of, among others, monitoring compliance with the business's maximum occupancy load, identifying underage and intoxicated persons, enforcing the rules and regulations of the business, and otherwise providing security for the business and its patrons. 
Security supervisor means a security person who is responsible for supervising and overseeing security persons. 
Voluntary occupant load means the maximum number of people allowed in a late night entertainment establishment after midnight, if requested by the owner of the establishment and so designated on the application for a permit for a late night entertainment establishment. The voluntary occupant load must be less than the maximum occupant load and governs the amount of security required in the establishment after midnight.

Whereas, on October 14, 2014, city council enacted Ordinance No. 2014-36, imposing a moratorium on the opening of new establishments that sell alcohol, beer or wine for on-premises consumption after midnight in certain areas of the Peninsula. 
Whereas, one purpose of the moratorium was to allow the issue of an over concentration of such establishments to be studied. 
Whereas, city council appointed a committee of citizens to study the issue and provide a report to council as to its recommendations. 
Whereas, the committee consisted of representatives from the food and beverage industry, neighborhoods and the daytime business sector. 
Whereas, the committee met on a monthly basis, and at the city council meeting held on July 21, 2015, presented its report to city council. 
Whereas, one recommendation of the report was to test, for a period of ninety (90) days, the concept of a "soft closing", whereby establishments selling alcohol, beer or wine for on-premises consumption in the study area would be given the opportunity to remain open until 3:00 a.m., to measure if allowing patrons to remain on the premises of the affected establishment an extra hour would curb noise and traffic issues related to having patrons of all such establishments vacate the affected establishments by 2:00 a.m., and weigh the effects of a soft closing as it relates to noise and traffic and the effect on public safety operations. 
Whereas, the trial period ordinance was enacted on September 8, 2015 and the trial period ran from September 8, 2015 to December 7, 2015. 
Whereas, after studying the ninety-day trial period, it is now the committee's recommendation that a new six month trial period for the program be approved with the addition of certain rules and the revision of other rules related to the program. 
Whereas, it is the intent of the city that the soft closing program offer a fair and reasonable opportunity for all interested establishments citywide to prepare and participate in the trial program for the maximum benefit of all.

Sec. 19-131. - Findings. 
City council does hereby make the following findings: 
(a)  The peninsula area of the city, south of Mount Pleasant Street, is the traditional city center, where major institutional uses are located, where professional, retail and tourism commerce is mainly conducted and where the city's oldest and most significant architecture is situated. The ambiance of this area is special and unique to the City of Charleston, and its preservation is essential for Charleston to remain a successful working, central city. 
(b)  Over the past years, significant residential and commercial revitalization has occurred in this area of the city, and while revitalization enhances the economic and social viability of the city by growing and fortifying the tax base and providing additional employment and housing opportunities, increased traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, is an inevitable by-product. 
(c)  The built environment in this area of the city includes narrow streets, crowded sidewalks and historic buildings. On street parking, the zero-setback building pattern and bustling pedestrian activity on sidewalks often obstructs vision clearances at intersections and the maneuverability of vehicular traffic in general. 
(d)  The business transacted in this area of the city is myriad and varied, as are the vehicles that serve these enterprises and their patrons. Vehicles on the streets in this area of the city run the gamut, from cars to trucks to buses to delivery vehicles, service vehicles, touring vehicles, golf carts, low speed vehicles and animal-drawn carriages. The vast differences in the design, height, speed and weight of these vehicles all operating in crowded and close conditions implicate safety considerations, particularly with respect to non-regulated means of conveyance which, by design, are often smaller in size, height and weight than standard passenger vehicles, are speed-restricted, and may not be equipped with seat restraints or other safety options. 
(e)  Businesses providing transportation services to their patrons in, out and around this area of the city are becoming commonplace, and while such are worthy services, city council finds it necessary, in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to maintain professionalism in commerce and the ambiance of the historic districts, to address the use of non-regulated vehicles in the area of the city south of Mount Pleasant Street and the use of golf carts and low speed vehicles for the purpose of transporting business patrons. 
(Ord. No. 2014-68, § 1, 5-13-14)  
Sec. 19-132. - Definitions. 
Non-regulated vehicle shall mean any vehicle or other means of conveyance, whether self- propelled or propelled by motor or battery, that is not subject to state regulation, but excluding two-wheeled bicycles, tricycles, skateboards, rickshaws and animal drawn carriages. 
(Ord. No. 2014-68, § 1, 5-13-14)  
Sec. 19-133. - Prohibited. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful to operate a non-regulated vehicle on any street on the peninsula of the city, south of Mount Pleasant Street. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person or business to provide transportation for patrons, whether for hire or not, using golf carts or low speed vehicles, unless the properties where patrons are picked up and dropped off are owned or controlled by the same person or business by way of written lease or other tangible indicia of control.

The driver of a vehicle shall not drive within any sidewalk area, except at a permanent or temporary driveway. 
(Code 1975, § 33-29)  
Sec. 19-178. - Careless operation of a vehicle. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any vehicle without care and caution and full regard for the safety of persons and property. Any person failing so to do shall be guilty of careless driving or riding. The operation of any vehicle when the same or any of its appliances is not in proper or safe condition shall be prima facie evidence of careless driving or riding. 
(Code 1975, § 33-32)  
Sec. 19-179. - Limitations on backing; signal of intent to back. 
The driver of a vehicle shall not back the same into an intersection or over a crosswalk and shall not in any event or at any place back a vehicle unless such a movement can be made in safety. Any driver intending to back a vehicle shall signal his intention to pedestrians and other traffic and shall proceed with caution.

State Law reference— Limitations on backing, S.C. Code 1976, § 56-5-3810.  
Sec. 19-180. - Driving in funeral procession. 
Each driver in a funeral procession shall drive as near to the right-hand edge of the roadway as practical and follow the vehicle ahead as close as is practical and safe. Each vehicle in such funeral procession shall have its headlights turned on during the procession.

Cross reference— Funeral procession does not constitute parade, § 19-326.  
Sec. 19-181. - Driving through funeral procession. 
No driver of a vehicle shall drive between the vehicles comprising a funeral procession. 
(Code 1975, § 33-179)  
Sec. 19-182. - Unlawful use of a handheld electronic communication device. 
(a)  Whereas, in 2010, 3,267 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver, and in 2011, the number of persons killed was 3,331. An additional 416,000 persons were injured in 2010 and 387,000 people were injured in 2011 in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver. 
Whereas, the U.S. Department of Transportation reported that at any given daylight moment across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or manipulating electronic devices while driving, a number that has held steady since 2010. 
Whereas, Distraction.gov, the U.S. Department of Transportation official website for distracted driving, recently reported that sending or receiving a text takes a driver's eyes from the road for an average of 4.6 seconds; at 55 mph of driving, that is the equivalent of driving the length of an entire football field, blind. 
Whereas, city council finds that it is in the best interest of the citizens, visitors, and residents using the city's public rights-of-way to take action to improve the safety of our streets by prohibiting the use of handheld electronic communication devices for texting and other visual-manual subtasks such as emailing by those operating a vehicle in the City of Charleston. 
Whereas, city council finds that the dangers associated with texting and performing other visual-manual subtasks such as emailing are similar for operators of motor vehicles and operators of other types of vehicles such as skateboards, scooters, golf carts, bicycles, and mopeds. 
(b)  Offense. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, no person shall operate a vehicle on a public street or highway within the city limits while using a handheld electronic communication device. 
(c)  Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the following:

(1)  Green alone means that: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn, but vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited, and

c.  Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Yellow alone when shown following the green signal or in combination with the green signal means that:

b.  Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway and any pedestrian then starting to cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles. 
(3)  Red alone means that: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain stopped until an indication to proceed is shown, except that when a sign is in place at the intersection permitting a right turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make the turn indicated by such sign after stopping. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection, and 
b.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic. 
(4)  Red with green arrow means that:

ARTICLE XIII. - NONCONSENSUAL TOWING OF VEHICLES 
 
Sec. 19-394. - Findings of council. 
City council finds in many instances when a vehicle is towed from private property without the owners knowledge or consent that vehicle owners are at the complete mercy of the tow truck operators and as such, are subjected to instances of price gouging and other overly stringent requirements for the return of their vehicles. 
City council finds that due to the unique parking arrangements in some downtown parking lots where city staff operates parking lots on leased private land many citizens and visitors alike are frequently confused over which lots are private or public; and 
City council finds that there is often inadequate signage, indicating the times when a car may be towed or of the price of a nonconsensual tow thereby inadequately apprising the public of the maximum risks of imprudent parking; and 
City council finds that owners or operators of towed vehicles believe their cars have been stolen and that the police department must respond, and to release their cars, usually late at night, owners must go to one location to pay for the cost of towing and another location to actually take possession of their cars. Car owners or operators can only retrieve their cars after paying cash. This scenario coupled with storage sites that are located on the outskirts of the city and in desolate locations tend to place the reluctant patrons in a dangerous situation; and 
Further, city council intends to exercise its police powers to ensure that the public security, general welfare, health and order of the city are adequately protected from price gouging and unscrupulous towing carriers.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2007-137, § 1, adopted July 17, 2007, amended former Art. XVI, §§ 19-461—19-475, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. XVI, §§ 19-461—19-475, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from 2000-245, § 1, 10-10-00; Ord. No. 2002-74, § 1, 5-28-02. 
 
Sec. 19-461. - The operation of rickshaws regulated. 
(a)  City council hereby makes the following findings of fact: 
(1)  The number of persons using the public streets in the Peninsula Area of the City of Charleston in the recent years has increased dramatically due to an expanded commercial use and the growing tourism industry. As a result, congestion on the streets in the Peninsula Area has increased because of a rise in the number of vehicles and pedestrians using the streets and sidewalks. 
(2)  Rickshaws pickup and discharge passengers at numerous locations in the Peninsula Area and tend to congregate at or near restaurants, places of assembly, and the market area. The continued proliferation of rickshaws in the Peninsula Area tends to create a carnival or theme-park atmosphere which is destructive of the historic and traditional ambiance of the Peninsula Area which is substantially made up of Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century structures. Therefore, in order to protect the historic and traditional ambiance of the Peninsula Area, city council finds it necessary to regulate rickshaws operating on the public right-of-ways in the Peninsula Area. 
(3)  Rickshaws, as hereinafter defined, are by their design and nature, slow moving, and pose a potential danger for those using the vehicles and the streets. The unregulated operations of rickshaws on the streets of the Peninsula Area would add to the congestion in the streets and would greatly inconvenience, if not endanger users of the streets in the area. As a result, it is in the public interest, and for the public's safety and welfare, that the users of the public right-of-ways be protected from unregulated vehicles which hinder travel or which pose dangers or distractions which give rise to accidents and inconvenience. 
(4)  The city approved a rickshaw pilot program July 20, 2010, authorizing additional rickshaw tokens to be distributed for night time use. As a result of the token pilot program, city council believes that there is an increasing demand for the use of rickshaws by residents and visitors in the district and that a limited increase in the number of rickshaws permitted in the district is in the public's best interest; 
(5)  City council further finds, for the same reasons, that electric, oil or gasoline powered rickshaws in operation in the Peninsula Area would not be in the public interest. 
(Ord. No. 2007-137, § 1, 7-17-07; Ord. No. 2011-29, § 1, 4-12-11)

Operator shall be defined as any person who operates, drives, or propels a rickshaw. 
Owner shall be defined as any person partnership, corporation, association, or other organization engaged in the business of transporting persons for hire or any other remuneration by a rickshaw.

This definition shall not include a bicycle built for two (2) where the operators are seated one behind the other, nor shall it include the operation of a bicycle with trainer or beginner wheels affixed thereto, nor shall it include a wheelchair or other vehicle with the purpose of operation by or for the transportation of a disabled person, nor shall it include a tricycle built for a child or an adult with a seat for only one (1) operator and no passenger.

DIVISION 2. - ABATEMENT 
 
Sec. 21-61. - Abatement; immediate danger. 
(a)  Whenever a complaint is made to a city department of the existence of a public nuisance, as defined in section 21-51, that department shall promptly determine whether it has proper jurisdiction over the type of nuisance to be abated or whether another city department has proper jurisdiction. If it is determined that another city department, other than the one receiving the initial complaint, has proper jurisdiction then the proper department shall be notified immediately. In any event, the appropriate city department exercising jurisdiction shall cause to be inspected the property on which it is alleged that such public nuisance exists. Should the department find that a public nuisance exists, and that the public health, safety or welfare may be in immediate danger, then summary abatement procedures shall be implemented and the department may cause the nuisance to be removed or abated. The department shall notify the chief building official if the public nuisance involves a building that appears structurally unsafe. The chief building official, upon being notified by the department shall cause the building on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists to be inspected and submit a written report of such inspection, including photographs, and the findings to the department that made the initial report. 
(b)  When summary abatement is authorized, the department shall issue a notice to the owner under the provisions of 21-62 (b) and (c) and shall simultaneously post the property.

(a)  Whenever a complaint is made to a city department of the existence of a public nuisance, as defined in Section 21-51, that department shall promptly determine whether it has proper jurisdiction over the type of nuisance to be abated or whether another city department has proper jurisdiction. If it is determined that another city department, other than the one receiving the initial complaint, has proper jurisdiction then the proper department shall be notified immediately. In any event, the appropriate city department exercising jurisdiction shall promptly cause to be inspected the property on which it is alleged that such public nuisance exists. If, after inspecting the property on which the nuisance is reported, the department declares the existence of a public nuisance, but the nature thereof is not such as to require the summary abatement of such nuisance, then, regular abatement procedures shall be followed. Photographs and reports of the findings and inspections shall be made and filed with the department. 
(b)  The department shall determine the individual, firm or corporation who, from the records in the county tax assessor's office, appears to be the titled owner of the aforesaid property and cause a written notice to be served on such individual, firm or corporation by personal service or by leaving a copy of the notice at the usual place of residence or business of such owner, or address of such owner shown in the county tax assessor's records, or by copy mailed to such owner at such place or address by United States certified mail return receipt. If service of such written notice is unable to be perfected by any of the methods described above, the department shall cause a copy of the aforesaid notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, and shall further cause a copy of the aforesaid notice to be left with the individual, if any, in possession of such property on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists, or if there is no individual in possession thereof, the department shall cause a copy of the notice to be posted at such structure, location or premises. The department shall also determine from the office of the county register of mesne conveyance, who the lienholder of the property, if any, as documented therein, is and cause a written notice to be served on such lienholder by United States mail return receipt. 
(c)  The aforesaid notice to the owner, and lienholder, if any, of the property shall state clearly and concisely the findings of the department with respect to the existence of a public nuisance. The notice shall further state that unless the owner thereof shall cause the abatement of the public nuisance, pursuant to the orders contained in the departments notice, the public nuisance shall be abated by the city at the expense of the owner. 
(d)  Any person who is the record owner of the premises, location or structure at the time an order pursuant to this article is issued and served upon him, shall be responsible for complying with that order, and liable for any costs incurred by the city therewith, notwithstanding the fact that he conveys his interests in the property to another after such order was issued and served. 
(e)  It shall not be a defense to the determination that a public nuisance exists that the property is boarded up or otherwise enclosed. 
(Ord. No. 2000-22, § 1, 2-22-00)  
Sec. 21-63. - Abatement by owner. 
(a)  Within thirty (30) days after the posting and mailing of a notice to abate a nuisance, the owner, agent of the owner, or individual in possession of the affected property shall remove and abate such nuisance or show that no nuisance in fact exists. The owner, agent of the owner, or individual in possession of the affected property shall file a written statement with the department that no nuisance in fact exists. However, the mere filing of the statement alone shall not be conclusive evidence of compliance with this ordinance, but shall be subject to verification and/or rebuttal by the department. 
(Ord. No. 2000-22, § 1, 2-22-00)  
Sec. 21-64. - Appeal procedures; hearing.

Further, in those instances where the nuisance has been abated by the city, the owner or occupant of the property who has been served with a notice pursuant to this article may, within ten (10) days after completion of the abatement, demand to the department for a hearing to review the cost of the abatement. The hearings as allowed under this section shall be held as soon as practical but in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by the department of the written demand and at least two (2) days' notice of the hearing shall be given to the individual who made the written demand for the hearing. Further, the department shall advise the owner of the time and location of the hearing and the right to present evidence and to be represented by counsel. The hearing shall be informal and the decision of the board, as defined in subsection (b), shall be final.

(d)  In those instances where the nuisance has been abated by the city, and upon application of the owner, the appeals board shall have discretion to waive the cost of abating a nuisance, in whole or in part, if, in the course of the hearing reviewing the decision, the appeals board finds that any of the following did not conform to the provisions of this article:

(2)  No person may acquire a watercraft or outboard motor, subject to the titling requirements of this Division and Title 50 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, without obtaining a certificate of title or in the case of a new watercraft or outboard motor a manufacturer's or importer's statement of origin reflecting the person acquiring the watercraft or outboard motor as the original purchaser as provided in this Division and/or Title 50 of the South Carolina Code of Laws. In the case of watercraft or outboard motors from other jurisdictions that do not require titling, a bill of sale and proof of registration may be substituted for this title. 
(3)  No person may dispose of a watercraft or outboard motor subject to the titling provisions of this division and Title 50 of the South Carolina Code of Laws without transferring to the person acquiring the watercraft or outboard motor a certificate of title reflecting the transfer of the watercraft or outboard motor.

If a security interest has been perfected, the city must notify the lienholder by certified mail allowing thirty (30) days to respond. Failure to respond within thirty days or remove the watercraft or outboard motor by the date designated forfeits the equipment to the City to be used or disposed of according to law.

(2)  The surgeon general has reported that smoking is a significant cause of cancer, heart disease and lung disorders in smokers and passive smokers (those inhaling the smoke of others); and 
(3)  The City of Charleston in furtherance of its duty to provide such regulations as may be necessary to protect the health of its citizens and minimize the incidents of disease of its population, and to provide a working environment for its employees and the general public which is reasonably free of hazards and distractions, such as smoke, and in furtherance of the objectives of the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990, deems it to be in the public interests to regulate smoking in city-owned or operated indoor facilities.

(2)  The mayor, or his designee, is hereby authorized to designate portions of lobbies, restrooms and snack bars where smoking will be permitted; provided however, the mayor may determine that no area exists within certain city-owned buildings where smoking may be permitted due to: 
a.  Lack of adequately ventilated lobbies, restrooms and snack bars; or 
b.  The small size of buildings which prevent segregating smoking and nonsmoking areas. 
(3)  The mayor is hereby authorized to designate certain individually occupied private offices as "smoking permitted" areas, provided that he has first determined that smoking in those locations will only minimally affect the adjacent working environment.

(Ord. No. 1990-115, § 1, 9-11-90; Ord. No. 2007-14, § 2, 1-23-07)  
Sec. 21-132. - Regulations and requirements relating to the smoking of tobacco products in the city. 
(a)  Findings. As an incident to the adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives, the city council ("city council") of the City of Charleston, South Carolina (the "city") makes the following findings: 
(1)  The city is an incorporated municipality and as such possesses all powers granted to municipalities by the Constitution and the laws of the State of South Carolina, including the powers enumerated in S.C. Code Section 5-7-30 relating to regulating streets, markets, and public health; and 
(2)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing second hand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute has determined that second hand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually. The Surgeon General has declared that (i) secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmokers exposed to smoke; (ii) children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for sudden death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma; (iii) adults exposed to secondary smoke have a higher risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer; (iv) there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke (v) separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does not sufficiently remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas; and 
(3)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Studies have shown that employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. 
(4)  Studies have also shown that smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. 
(5)  There are laws, ordinances and regulations in place that protect workers from other environmental hazards, including Class A carcinogens, asbestos, arsenic and benzene, but none which regulate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; and 
(6)  Prohibiting smoking in the workplace increases public awareness of the negative health effects of smoking, reduces the social acceptability of smoking and reduces harm to children and other nonsmokers; and 
(7)  The South Carolina General Assembly at Section 44-95-10 et seq. (the "Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990") imposed certain limitations on smoking. For example, it limited smoking in government buildings (the definition of which includes city-owned buildings) except where the owner of such building shall designate smoking areas. Consistent with the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990, city council previously adopted section 21-131 of the City Code. In that ordinance, city council made the following finding: 
The City of Charleston in furtherance of its duty to provide such regulations as may be necessary to protect the health of its citizens and minimize the incidents of disease of its population, and to provide a working environment for its employees and the general public which is reasonably free of hazards and distractions, such as environmental tobacco smoke, and in furtherance of the objectives of the Clean Indoor Act of 1990, deems it to be in the public interest to regulate smoking in city-owned or operated indoor facilities. 
City council has now determined that additional regulation of smoking in areas beyond those addressed in the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990 and section 21-131 is appropriate in furtherance of its duty to protect the health of its citizens and employees in the workplace and therefore enacts this ordinance. 
(b)  Intent. City council finds that it is in the best interest of the people of this city to protect nonsmokers from involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace. Therefore, city council declares that the purpose of this act is to preserve and improve the health, comfort and environment of the people of this city by limiting exposure to tobacco smoke in the workplace.

( Ord. No. 2018-061, § 2, 5-8-18 )  
Sec. 21-134. - Outdoor smoking—Medical University and Roper Hospital facilities. 
(a)  Findings. The Medical University of South Carolina and Roper Hospital are contiguous health care facilities located in the downtown area of the city. The governing board of each of these facilities has designated their respective campuses, indoor and outdoor, to be smoke-free. These facilities are comprised of buildings larger, taller and more massive than in other areas of the city. The public streets and sidewalks within and abutting these complexes are narrow and heavily used by the employees, patients and visitors of these facilities. The U.S. Surgeon General has advised that exposure to secondhand smoke, even for brief periods of time, may adversely affect the heart and respiratory systems and increase the severity of asthma attacks, especially in children. And research substantiates that secondhand smoke is a toxic outdoor air pollutant that may cause or contribute to an increase in deaths or serious illness. Heretofore, in accordance with home rule powers devolved by the state constitution and general law, and in recognition of the danger posed by smoking tobacco or tobacco related products, city council enacted an ordinance prohibiting indoor smoking in workplaces. In light of the heavily used built environment of the Medical University and Roper facilities, and to promote the missions of each to discourage the use of tobacco and tobacco related products so as to protect the health of those seeking and providing medical treatment from the dangers posed by smoking and second smoke, and to protect the public from the effects of smoking and smoking-related litter and pollution, the city council deems it necessary and appropriate and in furtherance of the public health, safety and welfare that smoking be prohibited on certain streets and sidewalks in and abutting the Medical University of South Carolina and Roper Hospital facilities. 
(b)  Definitions. 
Smoking means the inhaling, exhaling, burning, lighting or carrying of a lighted cigarette, cigar, pipe or similar device or any other lighted tobacco product.

(e)  Severability. If any provision, clause, sentence or paragraph of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect the other provisions of this section which can be given effect without the invalid provision, clause, sentence, paragraph or application, and to this end, the provisions of this section are declared to be severable.

ARTICLE XI. - DECEPTIVE, MISLEADING AND AGGRESSIVE COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION 
 
Sec. 21-230. - Findings and purpose. 
This article is based on the following findings and purposes: 
(a)  The primary purpose of the public streets and sidewalks is use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
(b)  The number of persons using the public streets and sidewalks in the City of Charleston in recent years has increased dramatically due to an expanded commercial use and a growing tourism industry. As a result, the streets and sidewalks in the City of Charleston are more congested with vehicles and pedestrians. 
(c)  Solicitors have begun to utilize deceptive, misleading, and aggressive commercial solicitation in the City of Charleston, adjacent to or upon the streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way, by urging upon residents and visitors the use of their services through oral communication and distributed materials and by abruptly approaching residents and visitors. Such solicitors have refused to discontinue their actions despite being asked to cease by the residents and visitors of the City of Charleston. 
(d)  The deceptive, misleading, and aggressive commercial solicitation by such solicitors in the City of Charleston has negatively affected visitors' enjoyment of the City of Charleston and as a consequence visitors have expressed an intention not to return to the City of Charleston. 
(e)  City council finds that the success of such deceptive, misleading, and aggressive commercial solicitation requires that persons congregate and respond to such solicitation, thereby impeding pedestrian and vehicle travel.

Sec. 23-20. - Land development agreements. 
(a)  Findings. City council finds that the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina has enacted legislation known as the "South Carolina Local Government Development Agreement Act", State Act codified in Section 6-31-10, et seq. of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, (Supp. 1993), which legislation authorizes, in certain circumstances, the execution of land development agreements to encourage comprehensive and capital facilities planning, to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities for development, to encourage the efficient use of resources, and to reduce the economic cost of development. City council finds and determines that land development agreements may be useful to both the private and public sector by providing certainty in zoning, by setting forth a reasonable schedule of development and by enhancing the opportunity for comprehensive, planned development, and enacts this ordinance in furtherance of the authority evolved upon it by the South Carolina Local Development Agreement Act.

The application shall also include the current, and if applicable requested, zoning of the property and a site analysis, prepared by a registered engineer or surveyor, showing the location of existing manmade features, the location, size and type of grand trees, as defined in the zoning ordinance, where major circulation systems are proposed; general topographic information from topographic maps or other suitable maps using a contour interval not exceeding two (2) feet; and the location and description of identified cultural resources.

Subsequently enacted laws shall be applicable to property subject to a land development agreement, unless the agreement specifies otherwise, or unless, after a public hearing, city council determines that the application of such laws would materially alter or disrupt the development of the property as contemplated by the agreement, or as otherwise provided by the South Carolina Local Government Development Agreement Act, S. C. Code, Ann; Sec. 6-31-80(b)(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) (Supp. 1993).

At such review, the parties subject to the agreement must demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms and provisions of the development agreement, and must provide such information as the zoning administrator may request, and as may be otherwise provided in the agreement. If as a result of any periodic review, it appears that a person subject thereto has a committed a material breach of the terms or conditions of the agreement, such circumstance shall be reported to city council by the zoning administrator. Upon receipt of such report, city council, or such committee to which the matter may be referred by council, if it concurs with the zoning administrator's report, shall serve written notice to the applicable party, setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and determination of breach, and providing the applicable party a reasonable time in which to cure the breach. 
If such party fails to cure the material breach within the cure period, city council or the committee to which the matter has been referred, may unilaterally terminate or modify the land development agreement, provided that council or the committee, as appropriate, has first given the applicable party an opportunity to either rebut the finding and determination or to consent to an amended development agreement to address the concerns of city council or the committee with respect to its findings and determination, and has otherwise complied with the provisions of the development agreement pertaining to a material breach. 
(k)  Amendments/cancellation. Any land development agreement may be amended or cancelled by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement, or by their successors in interest.

In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the state act, or any part thereof, invalid or unenforceable, or in the event that the South Carolina General Assembly shall amend or repeal the state act, in whole or in part, each development agreement shall be reviewed to determine if such change in the state act results in a substantial impairment of the rights or obligations of any of the parties to such development agreement. Any part whose rights or obligations under a development agreement have been substantially impaired by a change in the state act shall have the right to immediately terminate the agreement as to all parties thereto by written notice to the parties to the development agreement.

Sec. 27-3. - Findings. 
City council hereby makes the following findings of fact: 
(a)  Uncontrolled stormwater runoff may have significant, adverse impacts on the health, safety, and general welfare of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. The potential impacts of uncontrolled stormwater can lead to the degradation of water quality and general riverine ecosystem through excessive or illegal pollutant discharges, erosion, and flooding thereby limiting or removing its designated and potential uses; 
(b)  Redevelopment of parcels exhibiting existing impervious surfaces greater than twenty (20) percent of the total site area is becoming common practice within the city, and is encouraged to provide community benefit and reduce urban sprawl. As such, the city desires to implement practices for these parcels to reduce stormwater runoff, control peak flow and improve water quality' for the betterment of the community and protection of downstream property and natural resources. 
(c)  The city is required by federal law [33 U.S.C. 1342(p) and 40 CFR 122.26] to obtain a NPDES permit from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control ("SCDHEC") for stormwater discharges from the city's stormwater system. The NPDES permit requires the city to impose controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants in stormwater to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) using management practices, control techniques and systems, design and engineering methods; and such other provisions which are determined to be appropriate for the control of such pollutants; and 
(d)  Additionally, certain facilities that discharge stormwater associated with an industrial activity, including construction, development, and re-development activities, are required by the South Carolina Code of Regulations 61-9-122 to obtain NPDES permits for such activities.

DIVISION 2. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 
 
Sec. 27-99. - Low lots or grounds constituting public nuisance or health hazard. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any owner with low lots which shall be found by the department of stormwater management to be a public nuisance or health hazard, to fail to eliminate such nuisance or hazard in such manner and within such times as the department of stormwater management shall direct. 
(b)  Inspections. Whenever it shall appear to the department of stormwater management that any low lots are in a condition to constitute a public nuisance or health hazard, it shall be the duty of the department of stormwater management to enter upon and thoroughly examine the low grounds in question to determine whether such lots should be drained, filled up, leveled, cleared or otherwise so improved as to remove the nuisance and health hazard there complained of or existing. 
(c)  Determination of hazard; order to correct. Should the department of stormwater management be of the opinion that the low lots in question ought to be filled up, leveled, cleared or drained, or otherwise improved as to remove the nuisance and health hazard, the department of stormwater management shall forthwith order and direct the owners of such low lots to take such action in such manner and with such materials and within such reasonable times as the department of stormwater management may prescribe. In no event shall the time prescribed be less than ten (10) days. 
(d)  Service of notice. Such notice shall be served on the owner or owners of the low lots in writing either in person, by registered mail, or by publication. Where a notice by registered mail is sent to the last known address of the owners it shall be deemed a service upon the owners of such lots. 
(e)  Noncompliance with notice; work done by city. In case of neglect or refusal of an owner to obey a notice as provided for in paragraph (d) of this Section, it shall be the duty of the department of stormwater management to cause the low lots in question to be filled up, leveled, cleared, drained or otherwise so improved as to remove the nuisance and health hazard. 
(f)  Costs of work done by city to constitute lien against property. The expenses and charges paid or incurred in case low lots shall be filled up, leveled, cleared, drained or otherwise improved by the department of stormwater management shall be paid in the first instance out of the city treasury and such expenses and charges shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred, which lien shall be enforced and collected in the same manner as municipal taxes. 
(g)  Nothing herein shall prevent the enforcement of any other remedy or remedies in other provisions of this Code or other laws and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2007-158, § 2, 8-21-07; Ord. No. 2018-150 , § 2, 11-27-18)

On all new construction, developments, or redevelopments required by the Standard Building Code to conform to requirements for new buildings, it shall be unlawful for any person to collect rainwater for deposit on any street, sidewalk or right-of-way, or otherwise suffer or permit, or by mechanical means propel, rainwater on such street, sidewalk or right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 2007-158, § 2, 8-21-07)  
Sec. 27-101. - Flood hazard areas. 
(a)  If, upon the determination and written notice of the building code official or any other responsible city official, a proposed structural use in any zone district of the city lies within an area of suspected flood hazard to public health or safety it shall be the duty of the building code official to withhold approval of building permits until one of the following requirements has been met: 
(1)  Documented, written evidence by a registered engineer that the proposed development does not place in hazard public health or safety, either on the subject property or upstream, or downstream. 
(2)  Documented, written evidence by the owner of the land or his agent further certified by a registered engineer that proposed improvements or standards such as flood proofing, filling, excavating, etc., will be instituted to overcome encroachment upon the normal water-carrying functions of adjacent streams resulting in hazards to public health and safety. 
(3)  Written evidence by the owner of the land or his agent that the development shall be confined to the following permitted uses with normal safeguards to public health and safety: 
a.  In or adjacent to residential developments: 
i.  Agricultural uses permitted under the provision of the zoning ordinance. 
ii.  Railroads, streets, bridges and public utility wire and pipe lines for transmission and local distribution purposes.

However, upon the event of a negative decision additional documentation may be presented which starts another thirty-day period. 
(Ord. No. 2007-158, § 2, 8-21-07)  
Sec. 27-102. - Stormwater management systems. 
(a)  Stormwater management systems for development in the city shall adhere, at a minimum, to the requirements as established by S.C. Code § 48-14-10, et. seq. (Supp. 2000), the Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, as the same may from time to time be amended. 
(b)  Consistent with requirements of the Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act, in areas of the city deemed by the director of stormwater management or his designee to require more stringent design specifications due to reoccurring flooding conditions, stormwater management systems shall be required to adhere to such development and design criteria as deemed necessary by the director of stormwater management or his designee. 
(c)  Within the area of the city delineated as the Church Creek Basin in the Master Drainage and Floodplain Management Plan dated May 1984, on file in the offices of the department of stormwater management, city council finds that because of the topography and the limited stormwater infrastructure, homes and other developed properties in the basin have experienced severe flooding during rainstorms that did not exceed the design rainfall event. The infrastructure now in place is not sufficient to adequately handle the stormwater discharge of the development that has occurred to date, and stands to be further adversely impacted as additional development occurs. It is evident that absent the implementation of reasonable regulations and specific criteria for the design and construction of permanent stormwater management systems associated with new development in the basin, both existing and planned, will be threatened. 
A special stormwater management area is established within which all new development shall adhere to special stormwater management design standards, which shall be designated as the Church Creek Special Stormwater Management Area and shall be defined as only that portion of the Church Creek basin that lies north of the existing railroad right-of-way, which is more specifically shown in the Master Drainage and Floodplain Management Plan dated May 1984 and the Stormwater Master Plan for the Church Creek Watershed on file in the offices of the department of stormwater management (hereinafter referred to as the "Church Creek Special Stormwater Management Area"). 
Within the Church Creek Special Stormwater Management Area, all permanent stormwater management systems associated with new development shall be designed and constructed to maintain the post-development peak flow rates at or below the pre-development peak flow rates, and to detain the excess runoff volume difference between the pre-development and post-development conditions for the design storm having a duration of 24-hours and frequencies of 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 years for a period of twenty-four (24) hours, with tolerances for a peak flow rate match for the 25- and 50-year storm events being plus or minus ten (10) percent, with all others matching pre post-development conditions. Detention facilities meeting these standards shall be designed and constructed to contain the excess volume for the twenty-four-hour period and the volume required to release the post-development peak flow at or below the pre-development peak flow rates, all as are more fully explained and specified in the Stormwater Master Plan for the Church Creek Watershed maintained on file in the office of the director of stormwater management or his designee, and which is incorporated herein by reference.

c.  There shall be no placement of any manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured park or existing manufactured home subdivision. 
(6)  High hazard areas—V or VE zones. Specific standards high hazard areas V or VE zones located within the areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash, and therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  All new construction within zones V and VE on the Charleston FIRM shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
b.  Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements in zones V and VE, if base flood elevation data is available on the Charleston FIRM, are elevated on pilings and columns so that: 
i.  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) of new construction is elevated to or above two (2) feet above the base flood level; and 
ii.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by the International Building Code or International Residential Code as adopted and periodically amended by the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. A registered professional engineer or architect licensed in South Carolina shall develop the structural design, specifications and plans for construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (6)b.i. and ii. of section 27-117 of the Code of Ordinances, of the City of Charleston, South Carolina. 
c.  New construction and substantial improvements within zones V and VE on the Charleston FIRM have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood latticework, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purposes of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect licensed in South Carolina certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
i.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
ii.  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundations system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. Such enclosed space shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. 
d.  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The building official shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist licensed in South Carolina which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
i.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
ii.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
iii.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
e.  Manmade alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands within zones VE and V on the Charleston FIRM which would increase potential flood damage shall be prohibited. 
f.  The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes is prohibited. 
g.  A modular building (manufactured) may be installed in a V or VE zone, providing the requirements in this subsection are met, and the building meets the standards of the South Carolina Modular Building Construction Act (S.C. Code 1976, § 23-43-10 et seq.) as may be amended from time to time, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
h.  Preconstruction and as-built design and breakaway wall certifications, where applicable, shall be provided by registered professional engineers and/or architects licensed in South Carolina for new and substantially improved structures in V or VE flood zones on the Charleston FIRM. These certificates shall also be provided for all lateral additions to structures in V or VE flood zones. 
i.  Enclosed areas below the lowest floor shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles, limited storage, and access to the primary occupancy (stairways and/or elevator). 
j.  Appurtenant features, defined as swimming pools, decks, gazebos, fences, and other features as determined by the building official as potentially causing an obstruction in the coastal high hazard area, must comply with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Technical Bulletin 5-93, Free of Obstruction Requirements, or any revisions thereto, incorporated herein by reference. 
(7)  Recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
a.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
b.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 27-117(4), Manufactured homes. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached structures.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2008-58, § 3, adopted April 8, 2008, renumbered former Art. III, §§ 27-109—27-126 as §§ 27-132—27-149. 
 
Sec. 27-132. - Findings. 
City council hereby makes the following findings of fact: 
(a)  The management of stormwater runoff and sediment is necessary to reduce pollution, siltation, sedimentation, local flooding and stream channel erosion, all of which impact adversely on land and water resources and the health, safety, property and welfare of the residents of the city; 
(b)  The city maintains a system of stormwater management facilities, including but not limited to, inlets, conduits, manholes, channels, ditches, drainage easements, retention and detention basins, infiltration facilities, and other components as well as natural waterways; 
(c)  The stormwater management facilities and components of the city need to be regularly rehabilitated, upgraded or expanded, and additional stormwater management facilities and measures need to be installed throughout the city; 
(d)  The city needs to upgrade its capability to maintain existing and future stormwater management facilities and measures; 
(e)  Every parcel of improved real property in the city both uses or benefits from the stormwater management system; and the improvement of existing facilities and construction of additional facilities in the system will directly benefit the owners of all improved real estate; 
(f)  Continued growth in the city will contribute to the need for improvements to and maintenance of the stormwater management system; 
(g)  The extent of use of the stormwater management system by each parcel of improved real property is dependent on factors that influence runoff, such as land use, intensity of development, amount of impervious surface, and location in a particular watershed or basin; 
(h)  Owners of improved real property and users should finance the stormwater management system to the extent they contribute to the need for the system, and derive special benefits therefrom, and charges therefore should bear a substantial relationship to the cost of the service; 
(i)  It is in the best interests of the citizens of this city and, most specifically, the owners of improved property, that a stormwater management utility and stormwater management utility fee system be established by ordinance and implemented as part of the city's utility enterprise system; 
(j)  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 12-37-250 (1976) persons sixty-five (65) years of age or older and certain persons who are totally and permanently disabled, or are legally blind are entitled to a reduction of ad valorem taxes upon application for a homestead exemption; 
(k)  City council finds that it is the public policy of the State of South Carolina that consideration be accorded those persons who are sixty-five (65) years of age or older and certain persons who are totally and permanently disabled or are legally blind in the payment of monies for the operation of local governments and their agencies, in recognition of the fact such persons are often on fixed incomes and least able to afford such payments; and 
(l)  City council is desirous of exempting from the payment of stormwater utility fees all properties that are designated for homestead exemptions on the Charleston County and Berkeley County tax records, and city council finds that an exemption from stormwater utility fees is in accordance with that public policy.

(b)  Multi-family residential property shall be charged a fee of seventy-five (75) percent of the base rate for each dwelling unit. 
(c)  Non-residential property shall be charged the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area of the property, as determined by the director of stormwater management or his designee, by one (1) equivalent residential unit (2,200 square feet). The numerical factor will be rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.01) of a unit. The minimum fee for any non-residential property shall be no less than the base rate. 
(d)  Undeveloped property shall be exempt from the fee. 
(Ord. No. 2007-158, § 2, 8-21-07; Ord. No. 2008-58, § 3, 4-8-08; Ord. No. 2018-150 , § 3, 11-27-18)

Sec. 27-142. - Fee adjustments. 
After the numbers of ERU's have been calculated based on existing site development and when certain criteria are met non-residential properties may be eligible for adjustments. Retention/detention adjustments are available for properties where private stormwater facilities exist. Self-contained stormwater system adjustments are available for properties that have self-contained stormwater facilities which do not directly discharge to any stormwater conveyance facility maintained by the city. However, no parcel shall be assigned an ERU of less than one (1) per parcel to reflect the costs of maintaining those parcels in the stormwater database, and to reflect the benefit each parcel receives through the incremental improvement of stormwater management throughout the city. It is the stormwater utility customer's responsibility to provide proof that conditions exist that may qualify a property for a particular adjustment. 
(a)  Retention/detention adjustments. The city may allow adjustment of stormwater charges for privately maintained retention and/or detention facilities upon inspection and approval of facilities by the director of stormwater management or his designee. The amount of the adjustment and requirements for receiving and maintaining those adjustments are as follows: 
(1)  The rate of the adjustment for privately maintained retention/detention stormwater facilities is based on the amount of reduced impact that the privately maintained stormwater facilities achieve. Rates of adjustment are as follows: 
a.  Where stormwater management facilities are constructed and maintained which reduce the maximum instantaneous rate of discharge from the property from a ten-year, twenty-four-hour storm event to less than or equal to the predevelopment rate, the utility customer shall receive a reduction of the fee by twenty-five (25) percent. 
b.  Where stormwater management facilities are constructed and maintained which reduce the maximum instantaneous rate of discharge from the property from a twenty-five-year, 24-hour storm event to less than or equal to the predevelopment rate, the utility customer shall receive a reduction of the fee by twenty-five (25) percent. 
c.  Where stormwater management facilities are constructed and maintained which reduce the maximum instantaneous rate of discharge from the property from a one hundred-year, 24-hour storm event to less than or equal to the predevelopment rate, the utility customer shall receive a reduction of the fee by twenty-five (25) percent. 
(2)  A non-residential property with private stormwater retention/detention facilities shall be eligible for an adjustment of fees when the following conditions are met: 
a.  Private stormwater facilities exist; 
b.  The utility customer has provided proof of reduced impact by submitting hydraulic/hydrologic calculations and topographic maps signed and sealed by an engineer registered in the State of South Carolina to the director of stormwater management or his designee; 
c.  The utility customer has provided a copy of a valid NPDES stormwater permit or a statement that no permit is required for the activity on the parcel; 
d.  The utility customer has entered into a maintenance agreement with the city for continued maintenance of the private stormwater facilities; 
e.  The proof of reduced impact upon city-owned or maintained stormwater facilities has been approved by the director of stormwater management or his designee; and 
f.  The owners of the parcel receiving adjustments of the city stormwater charges agrees that, prior to receiving such adjustments, it will provide maintenance on all private drainage structures, consistent with the requirements of the city and the city's maintenance practices for public drainage structures. 
(b)  Self-contained stormwater facilities adjustments. The city may allow adjustment of stormwater charges for self-contained stormwater facilities that reduce the amount of impact on city maintained stormwater facilities upon inspection and approval of facilities by the director of stormwater management or his designee. The amount of the adjustment and requirements for receiving and maintaining those adjustments are as follows: 
(1)  The rate of the adjustment for self-contained stormwater facilities is based on the amount of reduced impact that the privately maintained stormwater facilities achieve. The city may allow exemption from stormwater charges for any portion of the parcel that can be demonstrated to directly discharge into any drainage conveyance facility not maintained by the city. The adjustment in fee shall be one hundred (100) percent for that portion of the parcel that meets this criteria. 
(2)  A non-residential property with private stormwater facilities shall be eligible for an adjustment of fees for self-contained stormwater facilities when the following conditions are met: 
a.  Private stormwater facilities exist; 
b.  The utility customer has provided to the city information demonstrating its facilities qualify as self-contained facilities, including hydraulic/hydrologic calculations, topographic maps and other necessary information signed and sealed by an engineer registered in the State of South Carolina. 
c.  The utility customer has provided a copy of a valid NPDES stormwater permit or a statement that no permit is required for the activity on the parcel; 
d.  The utility customer has entered into an agreement with the city in which the property owner agrees to provide continued maintenance of the private stormwater facilities; 
e.  The proof of reduced impact upon city-owned or maintained stormwater facilities has been approved by the director of stormwater management or his designee; and 
f.  The owners of the parcel of property receiving adjustments of the city stormwater charges agrees that, prior to receiving such adjustments, it will provide maintenance on all private drainage structures, consistent with the requirements of the city and it's the city's maintenance practices for public drainage structures. 
(c)  Combining fee adjustments. Fee adjustments, as described in subsection (a)(1)a., through (a)(1).c. are cumulative and may be combined. A fee adjustment as described in subsection (b)(1) is not cumulative and may not be combined with the adjustment described in subsection (a) of this section. 
(d)  Multi-family residential property may be treated as non-residential property: When requested by the utility customer stormwater utility charges may be determined and billed based on requirements for non-residential property. 
(e)  "In-kind" payments allowed: The city and the utility customer may enter into an agreement in which (a) the utility customer agrees to maintain its private stormwater facilities that receive discharge from city stormwater facilities located on or adjacent to the owner's property, and (b) the city accepts the utility customer's maintenance services "in-kind" in place of payment of city stormwater utility charges. Valuation of any "in-kind" services provided by the utility customer shall be made based on the cost savings realized by the city.

Sec. 28-36. - Findings of city council. 
City council finds it necessary to promulgate standards to govern encroachments on public property including rights-of-way. Such public property is an integral component of the public realm, that should and must be available for public use, access and enjoyment without undue interference by private sector interests. The purpose of this article is to promote the public health, safety and welfare by establishing reasonable regulations to govern the placement, type, appearance and servicing of encroachments on public rights-of way so as to: 
(1)  Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience; 
(2)  Restrict unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress and egress from any residence or place of business, or from the street to the sidewalk by persons exiting or entering parked or standing vehicles; 
(3)  Provide for public and property safety during adverse weather conditions; 
(4)  Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of poles, posts, traffic signs, signals, hydrants, mailboxes, and access to locations used for public transportation purposes; 
(5)  Relocate and/or replace encroachments which result in visual blight and/or excessive space allocation on the public rights-of-way, or which unreasonably detract from the aesthetics of store window displays, adjacent landscaping and other improvements, as well as to have abandoned or neglected encroachments removed; 
(6)  Maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties; 
(7)  Reduce unnecessary exposure of the public to personal injury or property damage claims, 
(8)  Treat all applicants equally according to the standards set forth in this article and all applicable regulations promulgated in furtherance hereof; and 
(9)  Provide uniformity as to the type of encroachments and the means by which they are permitted.

Sec. 28-45. - Promotion of civil sidewalks. 
(a)  Findings. The King and Market Street corridors in the downtown area of the city are places of gathering and commerce, where patrons, residents and visitors conduct business, shop, sightsee and recreate. Being in the heart of the peninsula, these corridors offer an array of services to support residents living nearby and those coming into the peninsula to enjoy the urban core of the city, to include shopping, dining and art venues. Being in the heart of the tourism district, these corridors are heavily impacted not by just visitors, but also by vendors and service providers tending to the needs of the industry businesses. Being adjacent to the College of Charleston campus, these corridors are also impacted by students tending to daily needs or seeking places to recreate. The sidewalks of these corridors, part of an urban street grid established in the eighteenth century, are narrow by modern standards and are incapable of being enlarged in any meaningful way. It is imperative that pedestrian flow along the sidewalks of these corridors be safe, effective and efficient during times of heavy use. The primary purpose of a sidewalk is to provide a means of conveyance by foot. Interferences with that purpose should be minimized to the extent feasible. Sitting or lying on the sidewalks of the King and Market Street corridors during times of heavy use poses a threat to safe pedestrian passage, especially for the elderly, disabled, vision-impaired and small children. As there exist alternate public places in the vicinity of the King and Market Street corridors that accommodate sitting or lying down, council finds it necessary and in furtherance of the public peace and good order that sitting or lying on the sidewalks of the King and Market Street corridors be regulated in a manner that promotes safety but which preserves these areas for traditional constitutional expression and other lawful activity on sidewalks consistent with any city permitting requirements. 
(b)  Prohibition. During the hours between eight (8:00) a.m. and two (2:00) a.m., it is unlawful to sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk: 
(1)  On King Street, between Line Street and Broad Street; 
(2)  On streets crossing King Street for one (1) block in either direction of King Street between and including Line Street and Broad Street; 
(3)  On North and South Market Streets, between King Street and East Bay Street; and 
(4)  On streets crossing North and South Market Streets for one (1) block in either direction from North and South Market Streets between and including King and East Bay Street. 
(c)  Exceptions. The prohibitions in subsection (b) shall not apply to any person: 
(1)  Sitting or lying on a public sidewalk due to a medical emergency; 
(2)  Using a wheelchair, walker, or similar device as the result of a disability; 
(3)  Operating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to a sidewalk use permit; 
(4)  Participating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally, demonstration, meeting, picketing, or similar event conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to and in compliance with a street use or other applicable permit; 
(5)  Sitting on a fixed chair or bench located on the public sidewalk supplied by a public agency or by the abutting private property owner; 
(6)  Sitting in line for goods or services unless the person or person's possessions impede the ability of pedestrians to travel along the length of the sidewalk or enter a doorway or other entrance alongside the sidewalk; or, 
(7)  Who is a child seated in a stroller. 
(d)  Warning. No person shall be cited under this section unless the person engages in conduct prohibited by this section after having been notified by a police officer that the conduct violates this section. 
(e)  Other laws and orders. Nothing in any of the exceptions listed in subsection (c) shall be construed to permit any conduct which is prohibited by City Code sections 17-93, 17-98, and 21-109, which prohibit willfully and substantially obstructing the free passage of any person. 
(f)  Penalties. 
(1)  First offense. Upon conviction for a first offense of this section, the court shall impose a fine of not more than twenty-five dollars ($25.00). 
(2)  Subsequent offenses. Upon conviction for a second offense of this Section, the court shall impose a fine of not more than fifty dollars ($50.00). All further violations of this section maybe handled in a manner consistent with the City's general penalty provision as provided in section 1-16 of this Code. 
(3)  Trespass. In addition to these penalties, a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation of this section may be prohibited from returning to the streets and sidewalks delineated in subsection (b) for a period of sixty (60) days from the date such notice is given. Notice of this prohibition may be given by any code enforcement officer, police officer, city attorney or judge of municipal court. Upon conviction of this provision a person may be sentenced in a manner consisted with the city's general penalty provision as provided in section 1-16 of this Code in addition to the penalties set forth above. 
(g)  Reporting. One (1) year after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives, and every two (2) years thereafter, the police department shall make a written report to the mayor and the city council members that evaluates the effectiveness of enforcement of this section in the King and Market Street Corridors as set out herein. 
(h)  Outreach. The city shall maintain an outreach plan summarizing the city's efforts with assisting those that are chronically found sitting or lying down on a public sidewalk. The outreach plan must outline what assistance the city supplies to connect individuals in need of social services with providers of the social services. The plan must also include, but not be limited to, health care and social service capacity, evaluation of service delivery and identification of areas for improved service delivery. 
(i)  Severability. If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this Section be for any reason declared unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall not affect the validity or the effectiveness of the remaining portions of this section or any part thereof which can be given meaning without the offensive subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 29-1. - Findings of fact. 
The city council finds and declares that because the number of tourists coming to the city in recent years has increased dramatically, it is in the public interest that sightseeing vehicles, tour guides and certain commercial passenger vehicles which travel in the old city district and old and historic district of the city be regulated under the police power of the city. It is the purpose of such regulation to maintain, protect and promote the tourism industry and economy of the city and, at the same time, to maintain and protect the tax base and land values of the city, to reduce unnecessary traffic and pollution and to maintain and promote aesthetic charm and the quality of life for the residents of the city. The city council finds, further, that the numbers of unregulated tour vehicles and other commercial vehicles entering the city for the purpose of touring the historic districts are having adverse effects upon the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and that traffic accidents, damage to property, traffic congestion and other problems require the enactment by the city of a comprehensive tourism management ordinance. The council also finds that responsibilities for tourism management are of sufficient scope and complexity to justify a separate ordinance and organizational entity from that required for the administration of the arts and history interests of the city.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 1998-174, § 16, adopted Sept. 22, 1998, amended former Division 4, §§ 29-125—29-129 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Division 4 pertained to charter buses and derived from Ord. No. 1998-32, §§ 23—36, 5-10-83; Ord. No. 1985-148, § 4, 12-17-85. 
 
Sec. 29-125. - Findings of council. 
(a)  City council hereby makes the following finding of fact: 
(1)  The number of persons using the public streets in the Old and Historic District and the Old City District (the districts) in the recent years has increased dramatically due to an expanded commercial use and the growing tourism industry. As a result, the streets in the districts have increased congestion because of a rise in the number of vehicles, motorized and pedestrian, using the streets. 
(2)  To protect the historic and traditional ambiance of the districts, which not only promotes the welfare of the residents living therein, but also the welfare of the community at large due to the economic benefits generated by a viable and healthy tourism industry, and to promote and protect the safety of those using the streets in the districts, whether they be visitors or citizens, city council finds it necessary to restrict access to the streets in the districts to certain vehicles. 
(3)  Articulated vehicles and theme vehicles, as defined in section 29-2, are, by their design and nature, distracting, elongated, slow moving, bulky and cumbersome and, by their appearance, not in keeping with the ambiance of the Old City District or Old and Historic District. 
(4)  Control of access to and from such vehicles by users or pedestrians to and from the sidewalks or public streets is not readily manageable, thereby posing a potential danger for those using the vehicles and for those using the streets and sidewalks, be they pedestrians or persons in or on other vehicles. 
(5)  Articulated vehicles and theme vehicles on the streets of the Old City District and Old and Historic District would be detrimental to the ambiance and environment of the districts, and would add to congestion in the streets and would greatly inconvenience, if not endanger, users of the streets and sidewalks in the districts, all to the detriment of the character of the districts, the residents of the districts and the visitors to the districts. 
(6)  It is in the public interest, and for the public safety and welfare, that the streets in the districts, and the users thereof be protected from unreasonable encroachments or vehicles which hinder travel or which pose dangers or distractions which give rise to accidents and inconvenience. 
(Ord. No. 1998-174, § 16, 9-22-98)

Editor's note— Formerly numbered as section 29-202.  
Sec. 29-202. - Franchise agreement required; restrictions. 
(a)  Findings of fact: 
(1)  City council finds that certain of the operators of animal drawn vehicles in the old and historic district of the city have begun to utilize aggressive solicitation practices, adjacent to or upon the streets, sidewalks and public properties, urging upon citizens and visitors the use of their services; have abruptly approached citizens and visitors and thrust brochures in their hands, which are often unwanted and end up on the streets and sidewalks; have utilized solicitors, pamphleteers, persons holding signs, hawkers and pullers-in and have even placed fixed structures upon or adjacent to the streets, sidewalks and public properties to solicit business and/or distribute materials urging the use of their services. 
(2)  City council further finds that the success of such commercial practices requires that persons congregate and respond to such solicitation, thereby impeding pedestrian and vehicle travel. 
(3)  City council further finds that such practices have an adverse impact on the ambiance of the city and its old and historic district; tend to create confrontations with citizens and visitors; adversely impact pedestrian and vehicle traffic flow; create litter; tend to create nuisances; adversely impact the health, safety and well being of the public; and otherwise have a negative impact on the tourism industry and economy of the city. 
(4)  City council further finds that it is appropriate that, as a condition of operating animal-drawn vehicles in the old and historic district, all persons must obtain a franchise, and must agree to desist from the aforesaid business practices, which agreement shall be a condition of the franchise. 
(5)  City council further finds that the operation of animal drawn vehicles on the public streets is a privilege and not a right and such operation is for the benefit of the public. 
(6)  City council further finds in the adoption of this section, that this is part of an ongoing effort to reasonably regulate the conduct of business upon the streets and sidewalks of the central business district and the market area for the benefit of the general public. 
(b)  Franchise required: No person shall operate or cause to be operated upon the streets or sidewalks of the old and historic district of the city any animal-drawn vehicle, without first entering into a franchise agreement with the city. Such franchise agreement shall be granted for a period of one (1) year and shall expire on the anniversary of the date of execution; provided, however, upon compliance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and Chapter 29, Articles V and VI, the agreement shall be automatically renewed. The franchise agreement shall contain the following provisions, which provisions are material and go to the essence of the franchise agreement: 
(1)  The franchisee shall maintain a current business license. 
(2)  The franchisee shall agree to operate its business strictly in accordance with the ordinances of the city, applicable thereto, as from time to time amended. 
(3)  The franchisee shall agree that it will not carry out the following business practices, or suffer them to be carried out on its behalf, upon the sidewalks, streets and public properties in the old and historic district, or upon private property adjacent to such streets, sidewalks and public properties, but directed at persons upon such streets, sidewalks and public properties: 
a.  The distribution of pamphlets or other printed materials to solicit or advertise for business. 
b.  The use of hawkers, pullers-in, pamphleteers, or persons holding signs to solicit or advertise the business or inviting the public to make inquiries to such persons. 
c.  The placement of fixed structures for the purpose of sales, solicitation, hawking, pullers-in, pamphleteering or the support of signage or advertising. 
d.  The parking or storage of animals or equipment on the public streets and sidewalks, except to load or unload passengers in approved loading zones. Nothing herein shall regulate the parking or storage of animals or equipment on private property. 
(4)  Nothing herein shall prohibit the solicitation of business immediately alongside an animal-drawn vehicle in an approved loading zone so long as such solicitation is not done in a raucous manner. 
(5)  The franchise shall be nonexclusive. 
(6)  The franchisee shall agree that, upon the violation of the provisions of this section by the franchisee, its agents, employees, or persons acting on its behalf, the right to operate animal-drawn vehicles in the old and historic district shall be suspended as follows: 
a.  Upon two (2) violations within a six-month period, the franchise shall be suspended for a period not to exceed seven (7) days. 
b.  Upon three (3) violations within a one-year period, the franchise shall be suspended for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. 
c.  Upon four (4) violations within a one-year period, the franchise shall be suspended for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days. 
(c)  Administration and appeals. This section shall be administered by the director of tourism. All appeals from an interpretation or determination by the director of tourism shall be made to the tourism commission, within fifteen (15) days of notice of such interpretation or determination. All appeals from an adverse decision by the tourism commission shall be made to the Court of Common Pleas within thirty (30) days of such decision. 
(d)  Execution of agreement. City council, by the adoption of this section, authorizes the mayor to enter into a franchise agreement with any and all persons who desire to operate animal-drawn vehicles in the old and historic district. Unless otherwise stated, each franchise agreement shall automatically renew on January 1 of every year so long as the franchisee is in good standing.

a.  The lawful use of land existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter, or of an amendment thereto, although such use does not conform to the provisions thereof, may be continued, except for rental of amusement and recreational vehicles, which shall be governed by Section 54-223; but if such nonconforming use is discontinued, as evidenced by lack of use for a period of at least three years or by substitution of a conforming use, any future use of said land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
b.  The lawful use of a building or structure, existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter, or an amendment thereto, although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof, may be continued except for signs, which shall be governed by Article 4, and rental of amusement and recreational vehicles which shall be governed by Section 54-223, and establishments located within 500 feet of a residential zoning district and which allow for on-premise consumption of alcohol, beer or wine after midnight, which shall be governed by Section 54-206, and such use, with the exception of accommodations uses, bed and breakfast uses, two-family dwelling uses and multi-family dwelling uses, may be extended throughout the building or structure provided such extension does not displace a conforming use and provided no structural alterations are made, other than those necessary to assure the safety of the building or structure. 
c.  A non-conforming use of a building or lot cannot be changed to another non-conforming use unless the Board of Zoning Appeals, after a duly advertised public hearing, finds that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards for the protection of the public interest and the value of neighboring properties, including, but not limited to, limitations on the days and hours during which the proposed use may be open to the public. 
d.  Whenever a non-conforming use of a building has been changed to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed back to a non-conforming use. 
e.  Whenever a non-conforming use of a building, or a portion thereof, has been discontinued, as evidenced by the lack of use, or vacancy for a period of at least three years, or by substituting a conforming use, such non-conforming use shall not thereafter be re-established and the future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

a.  The total mining area, work zone and construction access road is shown on a scaled site plan of the property, and is intended as preparation for residential use, recreational use or agricultural use. 
b.  The mining use will not last more than one (1) year from the date of approval. 
c.  The mining work zone, as shown on the scaled site plan, will be located at least fifty (50) feet from any property boundary and at least one hundred (100) feet from any dwelling. 
d.  A mining operation has not occurred on the subject property within three (3) years prior to the date of the application. 
e.  Variances and/or special exceptions from Article 3, Part 6: Tree Protection Requirements, if required, have been approved. 
f.  Existing vegetation will be maintained and adequately protected as a natural buffer between adjacent dwellings, existing water bodies or wetlands and the mining work zone.

h.  The applicant will not use any office facilities at the mining location except in the LI and HI zone districts. 
i.  A stabilized access road for mining vehicles will be constructed and maintained to the specifications of the City Engineer and to a minimum depth of 50 feet from the public right-of-way. 
2.  Mining operations exceeding two (2) acres in area shall be allowed in the Light Industrial (LI) and Heavy Industrial (HI) zone districts as an exception where the Board, after review, finds that: 
a.  The applicant agrees in writing to restrict the hours of operation for mining operations to between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday through Saturday. 
b.  Variances and/or special exceptions from Article 3, Part 6: Tree Protection Requirements, if required, have been approved. 
c.  The size, shape and location of the area to be mined are such that it will allow for the conversion of the mining area into an amenity for the eventual use of the property. Evidence for this finding shall require the submittal of a plat of the property which 1) complies with the preliminary plat requirements of Section 54-810; 2) indicates the limits of clearing and excavation for the mining operation; 3) indicates the intended post-mining use of the mining area and other areas of the tract in conjunction with the Zoning Ordinance; and 4) indicates the depth of the mined area and the final slopes of the sides.

PART 4 - ACCESSORY USES 

Sec. 54-208. - The following provisions shall apply to all residential short term rentals ("STR"). 
a.  General Requirements. A residential short term rental use may be permitted as a Category 1, Category 2, or Category 3 STR Permit, if the zoning administrator determines the STR to be an accessory use to the principal residential use on a property which satisfies the requirements of Section 54-208.1, 54-208.2, or 54-208.3, as applicable, and issues a permit for such STR use. 
b.  Operational Requirements. In all cases, Category 1, 2 or 3 STR uses shall adhere to the following operational requirements: 
1.  The residential STR shall be operated by the record owner of the subject property who shall also be a resident of the subject property and who shall be residing overnight on the property while residential STR guests are present; and 
2.  The property shall not contain signs advertising the STR use; and 
3.  If meals are served by the resident owner, no meals other than breakfast may be served to the paying guests; and 
4.  The record owner of the subject property must keep in full force and effect during all times the STR is operated a general liability policy with a company authorized to do business in the State of South Carolina insuring against personal injury (including death) and property damage with limits of no less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence; and 
5.  The resident owner shall keep a current guest register including names, addresses, telephone numbers and dates of occupancy of all guests; and 
6.  The resident owner shall comply with all business license and revenue collection laws of the City of Charleston, Berkeley County or Charleston County, whichever is applicable, and State of South Carolina; and 
7.  The resident owner shall provide a rental packet containing applicable city rules and restrictions specified in the Residential STR Permit application materials, as well as pertinent unit safety information and contact information to guests when they book the STR and shall prominently display the STR Permit, rules, safety and contact information within the STR; and 
8.  Each Category 1, 2, or 3 STR permittee is entitled to rent, list with a booking or listing service, advertise, make available for STR use, or otherwise market only one (1) STR unit; and 
9.  The resident owner and the owner's agent shall list the Residential STR Permit number on all advertisements, listings with booking services, and marketing materials, including without limitation, Airbnb, VRBO/Homeaway, FlipKey, and any other online websites and listing or booking platforms or services. 
10.  The residential STR shall not be expanded in any respect beyond the specific rooms which were designated as part of a residential STR unit on plans relied upon by the city in approving a residential STR permit or beyond the maximum number of guests listed on the residential STR permit, nor shall the use be changed to any other use not permitted by the Zoning Ordinance without reapplication to and approval by the zoning administrator. 
c.  Application Procedure. 
1.  New Applications. Applications for new Category 1, 2 or 3 STR Permits shall be notarized and include the following: 
(a)  The location and name of the record owner of the property; and 
(b)  An application fee; and 
(c)  Floor plans drawn to scale of the habitable structures on the property that clearly designate all rooms to be used by STR guests, and the specific room or rooms to be used by guests for sleeping; and 
(d)  A site plan of the lot showing the location of the proposed Residential STR unit and the required off-street parking spaces and driveways; and 
(e)  A photograph or photographs of the current principal view or views of the structure where the residential STR unit is to be located; and 
(f)  A statement which the resident-owner must sign acknowledging that he or she has reviewed and understands the requirements of this section and the applicable section for the category of permit requested. 
Upon receiving a complete application and prior to the issuance of a new STR permit, the zoning administrator shall cause notice to be posted on the property upon which the proposed STR use is to be located for fifteen (15) consecutive calendar days, advising that the Resident-owner of the property has applied for a zoning permit to establish a STR use at the location and supplying a phone number to call for further information. During this fifteen (15) calendar day period, the zoning administrator shall determine if the application meets the requirements as set forth in this section. If, at the end of the fifteen (15) day posting period, the zoning administrator determines that the application meets the requirements for the STR use requested, the zoning administrator shall notify the applicant that the application is approved and shall, after waiting an additional five business days to allow for appeals, issue the STR Permit, which shall be valid for one (1) year from the date of issuance, and shall be renewable annually unless revoked. Any appeals filed within the five-day period shall cause the issuance of the STR Permit to be stayed pending resolution of the appeal. 
2.  Renewal Applications: 
(a)  For renewal of an STR permit, a property owner shall be required to recertify compliance with this section for the STR use with the zoning administrator. An application for annual recertification of the STR permit must include the application fee, an affirmation by the applicant that the nature of the STR use at the property has not changed, and must be notarized, filed with, and approved by the zoning administrator to continue the STR use. 
(b)  Upon a change in ownership of a property, and prior to the issuance of a new business license to allow continuation of an existing, permitted STR use upon said property, the new property owner shall be required to recertify compliance with this section for the STR use and submit plans reaffirming the specific room or rooms to be used for the STR unit with the zoning administrator. An application for recertification of the STR use must include the required plans and be notarized, filed with, and approved by the zoning administrator prior to the STR use by the new property owner. 
3.  On an annual basis the zoning administrator shall determine whether each STR use permitted under this section remains in compliance with all the terms of this chapter, and shall initiate such enforcement procedures as may be appropriate. All operators of STR uses permitted under this Section shall cooperate fully with the zoning administrator and his designees, including, but not limited to, providing pertinent information upon request and affording access to that portion of the property which is used for the STR use for reasonable site inspections. 
d.  Existing Approved Bed and Breakfast Uses. All approved, legal bed and breakfast uses that are operating on the effective date of this ordinance or that are entitled to be in operation on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives on properties outside the Short Term Overlay Zone shall be issued a Category 1 or Category 2 STR Permit, depending on their location. Such previously approved uses shall adhere to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance in effect prior to April 10, 2018.

7.  Such occupation shall be carried on by a resident, members of his family living on the premises, and no more than one full-time or part-time nonresident employee who works at the residence used for the home occupation. The home occupation may have other employees who are not working at the residence, but work at other off-site locations, if applicable. For the purpose of this section, the term "nonresident employee" includes an employee, business partner, co-owner, or other person affiliated with the home occupation, who does not live at the site, but who may work at the site as a part of the home occupation. 
8.  Display of products shall not be visible from the street and only articles made on the premises may be sold on the premises.

13.  Nothing in this section shall allow zoning approval for a home occupation which creates or causes to be created noises, noxious odors, or conditions injurious to the health, safety, morals, or welfare of the community. The Board of Zoning Appeals-Zoning shall review all appeals to decisions of the Zoning Administrator. Such zoning approval shall be revoked upon a finding that any home occupation established under this Chapter fails at any time to meet the requirements prescribed herein. 
In granting the zoning approval for a home occupation, the Zoning Administrator may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations, conditions or safeguards, as deemed necessary to fulfill the purposes and intent of this Chapter. 
b.  Expiration. The Zoning Permit for a home occupation shall expire under the following conditions: 
1.  Whenever the applicant ceases to occupy the premises for which the home occupation was issued. No subsequent occupant of such premises shall engage in any home occupation until a new permit has been issued through proper application. 
2.  Whenever the applicant fails to exercise the use permitted for any period of twelve (12) consecutive months. 
3.  Whenever in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator the home occupation exceeds the limitations of this Chapter or the restrictions stated on the zoning approval, a notice which revokes the Home Occupation zoning approval shall be mailed by certified mail to the licensee stating the date the permit is to be voided. The licensee may request a hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals-Zoning for a reinstatement of the Home Occupation zoning approval.

Sec. 54-230. - Purpose of creating districts. 
In order to promote the economic and general welfare of the city and of the public generally, and to insure the harmonious, orderly and efficient growth and development of the city, it is deemed essential by the city council of the city that the qualities relating to the history of the city and a harmonious outward appearance of structures which preserve property values and attract tourist and residents alike be preserved; some of these qualities being the continued existence and preservation of historic areas and structures; continued construction of structures in the historic styles and a general harmony as to style, form, color, proportion, texture and material between structures of historic design and those of more modern design.

Sec. 54-237. - Application and review procedure. 
Pre-Application Conference: Applicants are required to meet with staff prior to applying for Conceptual Approval for projects exceeding 10,000 square feet to assure the applicant is acquainted with and has an understanding of the Board's Guidelines. Applicants for projects of 10,000 square feet or less are encouraged, but not required, to likewise meet with staff prior to applying for Conceptual Approval. 
Conceptual: Review of the general height, scale, mass and three dimensional form of a building, or an addition to an existing building, and the general architectural direction and quality of the project as it relates to its site, its neighborhood, its immediate surroundings and the City of Charleston. This phase defines the overall quality and architectural character of the project. 
Preliminary: Review of the development of the conceptual design and its relationship to its context in terms of the project's details, finishes and materials. This phase defines the level of quality of construction, and the relationship of the building's components to surrounding buildings and to one another. 
Final: Review of the completion of the preliminary design based on completed construction documents and material specifications for consistency with the level of quality of the previous phases. Final Review of BAR-L projects shall be by the Board, unless the Board delegates the review to staff. Final Review of BAR-S projects shall be by staff; provided however, at its discretion, staff may require Final Review to be undertaken by the Board; and provided further that the BAR-S, in its discretion, may request to undertake Final Review. Any final review that is delegated to staff is for the purpose of assuring that for-permit construction drawings comply with the approved design. 
Comparative Reviews: For each review after Conceptual approval, or if the applicant is required to submit more than one conceptual submittal, the applicant shall show on the same sheet the previous proposal for comparison to the current proposal 
Courtesy Review: At the discretion of staff, an applicant may be requested to submit to a courtesy review of a project by the Board to receive informal initial feedback as to the direction of the project. 
Affordable/Workforce Housing Projects: Projects which include affordable or workforce housing units that are submitted by the application deadline and which comply with all submittal requirements shall be placed on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, subject to Rules of the Board if any, that limit the number of items on agenda. 
In the case of very minor projects involving repair or alterations to existing structures, the Board of Architectural Review, if the preliminary drawings and other data are sufficiently clear and explicit, may grant preliminary and final approval at one review session. Should said data indicate alterations, remodeling, or repairs not changing the exterior appearance, the administrative officer may exempt the application from provisions of this section and approve a Certificate of Appropriateness.

b.  In reviewing an application to demolish, or demolish in part, or remove, or alter the exterior architectural appearance of any existing structure, the Board of Architectural Review shall consider, among other things, the historic, architectural and aesthetic features of such structure, the nature and character of the surrounding area, the historic or culturally important use of such structure and the importance to the city. 
c.  In reviewing an application for new construction in the Old and Historic District, Old City District or Historic Corridor District, the Board of Architectural Review shall consider, among other things, the general design, the character and appropriateness of design, the height, scale and mass of the structure, the arrangement, texture, materials and color of the structure in question, and the relation of such aspects, features and elements to similar aspects, features and elements of structures in the immediate surroundings. Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter to the contrary, in passing upon an application, the Board of Architectural Review is empowered to require the use of architectural techniques such as building façade and mass modulations or adjustments to the footprint of a structure on a site to achieve appropriate form and proportion of a structure in relation to its immediate surroundings, so long as such techniques do not unreasonably restrict the use of a site in light of its underlying zoning. The Board of Architectural Review shall not consider interior arrangement or interior design; nor shall it make requirements except for the purpose of preventing designs of developments which are not in harmony with the prevailing character of Charleston, or which are obviously incongruous with this character. 
d.  Among other grounds for considering a design inappropriate and requiring denial or deferral and resubmission are the following effects: Arresting and spectacular effects, violent contrasts of materials or colors and intense or lurid colors, a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance, the absence of unity, visual compatibility and coherence in composition, form and proportion not in consonance with the dignity and character of the present structure (in the case of repair, remodeling or enlargement of an existing structure) or with the prevailing character of the immediate surroundings (in the case of a new structure).

f.  The Board of Architectural Review may refuse a permit or Certificate of Appropriateness for the erection, reconstruction, alteration, demolition, partial demolition, or removal of any structure within the Old and Historic District, which in the opinion of the Board of Architectural Review, would be detrimental to the interests of the Old and Historic District and against the historic character and public interest of the city. 
g.  Upon receiving an application for the demolition or removal of a structure over fifty (50) years old and within the limits of the Old City District, the Board of Architectural Review, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the application, shall either approve or deny such application, or find that the preservation and protection of historic places and the public interest will best be served by postponing the application for a designated period, which shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from the receipt of the application, and notify the applicant of such postponement. 
h.  In any case involving the demolition or partial demolition or removal of a structure, before granting approval or requiring a postponement, the Board of Architectural Review may call on the chief building official to provide it with a report on the state of repair and structural stability of the structure under consideration. 
i.  In all applications involving the demolition or partial demolition or removal of a structure, provision shall be made for a public hearing as set forth in this article. 
j.  Within the period of postponement of such demolition, partial demolition or removal of any structure, the Board of Architectural Review shall take steps to ascertain what the City Council can or may do to preserve such structure, including consultation with private civic groups, interested private citizens and other public boards or agencies and including investigation of the potential use of the power of eminent domain when the preservation of a given structure is clearly in the interest of the general welfare of the community and of certain historic and architectural significance. The Board of Architectural Review shall then make such recommendations thereabout to the City Council as the board may determine to submit. 
k.  The Board of Architectural Review shall have the power to delay for a period of 180 days or deny outright the demolition, partial demolition or removal of a structure over 50 years old in the area bounded to the north by Mount Pleasant Street or the extensions thereof into the waters of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, to the east by the waters of the Cooper River to the south by the Old City District and to the west by the waters of the Ashley River.

Former Part 7 derived from this codification of the zoning ordinance and the following: Ord. No. 1999-54, § 4, 4-27-99; Ord. No. 2009-205, §§ 1, 2, 10-13-09; Ord. No. 2007-230, § 1, 12-6-07. 

Sec. 54-250. - PUD defined. 
A planned unit development consists of a tract or tracts of land planned and developed as a whole in a single development stage or phased series of development stages according to an approved PUD Master Plan. 
(Ord. No. 2013-125, § 1, 11-6-13) 
Sec. 54-251. - Intent. 
A planned unit development (PUD) is intended to provide flexibility in the design of developments; to encourage comprehensive planning of developments; to permit innovation in neighborhood design that includes incorporation of open space, preservation of natural features and other amenities; to provide opportunity for a mixture of uses within a development, and to insure compatibility of developments with surrounding areas. 
(Ord. No. 2013-125, § 1, 11-6-13) 
Sec. 54-252. - General application. 
a.  A tract or tracts of land is eligible for a PUD if the tract or tracts of land under consideration total five (5) or more contiguous acres. A PUD may include less than five (5) acres or contain non-contiguous parcels, if City Council, upon a recommendation of the Planning Commission, determines the PUD is an appropriate zoning classification because of the unique constraints of the land owing to the size, shape, topography or other physical conditions of the tract or tracts or because the proposed PUD is consistent from a land use and development perspective with an adjoining PUD. A PUD may consist of tracts of land owned by different owners provided that all owners agree in writing to the PUD Master Plan and provided that residential units and open space acreage requirements are allocated by tract in the PUD Master Plan and all subsequent plats and plans. PUD rezoning applications shall include the signatures of all property owners. 
b.  No person shall erect or alter any building, structure or sign on any tract of land or use any tract of land within a PUD except in conformance with the requirements and limitations of the ordinance approving the PUD Master Plan. No Site Plan, Phasing Plan, Subdivision Concept Plan, Preliminary Plat, Road Construction Plans or Final Plat shall be approved except in conformance with this Article and the ordinance approving the Master Plan. 
(Ord. No. 2013-125, § 1, 11-6-13) 
Sec. 54-253. - Procedures for review. 
a.  Generally. The procedure for approving a PUD application is divided into three steps which may be combined as described below. 
Step 1. PUD Pre-Application Plan Review is intended to provide city staff with an introduction to the proposed development and a chance to comment on the proposal before the expenditure of funds in preparation of a Master Plan. 
Step 2. Approval of a Master Plan and accompanying rezoning ordinance requires review by the Technical Review Committee and two public hearings, one with the Planning Commission, and one with City Council. Approval of a Master Plan and accompanying rezoning ordinance by City Council constitutes a rezoning of the property and establishes all site development regulations for future development on the property. Where applicable, the Subdivision Concept Plan, in accordance with Article 8, may proceed concurrently with this step. 
Step 3. Subdivision Concept Plan Approval begins the process of subdividing property and building public improvements to serve the site. This step requires review by the Technical Review Committee and approval of the Planning Commission after a public hearing. After Subdivision Concept Plan approval, applications for preliminary plat and road construction plans approval shall be approved by the Technical Review Committee. Final Plat is approved by the Plat Review Committee. 
b.  Administration. All petitions, applications and supporting documents for a PUD shall be filed with the office of the Zoning Administrator, who shall maintain and make available for public inspection records of all applications and related actions. The PUD rezoning application must be signed by the owner(s). 
c.  Fees. All applications shall be accompanied by payment for applicable fees as set forth in the fee schedule for the Department of Planning, Preservation and Sustainability. 
d.  PUD Pre-Application Plan Review. 
1.  Applicants for a PUD shall schedule a meeting with the Director of the Department of Planning, Preservation and Sustainability and representatives from other City departments to present their proposal and receive staff comments. Twelve (12) sets of the PUD Conceptual Plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Division in the Department of Planning, Preservation and Sustainability at least ten working days prior to the scheduled meeting. 
2.  The Planning Director shall consult with other appropriate City departments and advise the applicant of the application's conformance with relevant plans adopted by City Council and shall provide comments within ten days following the meeting with the applicant. 
e.  Master Plan Review. 
1.  Applicants for a Master Plan PUD shall submit twelve (12) sets of the information required for Master Plans prior to the deadline for the next scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission. Applicants wishing to receive Subdivision Concept Plan approval concurrently with Master Plan approval in accordance with Article 8, shall submit eight (8) sets of the Subdivision Concept Plan which satisfies the information requirements in Article 8. 
2.  The Zoning Administrator shall first determine if the application is complete. If complete, the Zoning Administrator shall refer the application to the Technical Review Committee and Planning Commission for the next scheduled meetings, and advertise a public hearing on the proposed Master Plan PUD application. 
3.  The Technical Review Committee shall review the application and provide the Planning Commission with written comments at the public hearing. Utility providers and regulatory agencies may also be consulted. 
4.  The Planning Commission shall review the application, hold a public hearing, and make a recommendation to the City Council to approve, approve with modifications and/or conditions, or disapprove the application. 
5.  After the Planning Commission has made its recommendation, the Zoning Administrator shall forward the application with the recommendation to the Clerk of Council. The Clerk of Council shall then set the date for, and advertise the public hearing on the application, to be held at a scheduled meeting of City Council. 
6.  Following the public hearing, the City Council shall approve, approve with modifications and/or conditions or disapprove the application for Master Plan PUD subject to Article 9: Part 3 Changes and Amendments. 
7.  Approved Master Plans shall be filed with the Department of Planning, Preservation and Sustainability. 
f.  Subdivision Concept Plan Approval. 
1.  Applicants shall submit eight (8) sets of the Subdivision Concept Plan prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 8. The Subdivision Concept Plan may be submitted after PUD Master Plan approval or concurrently with the PUD Master Plan per Article 8. 
2.  The Zoning Administrator shall first determine if the application is complete. If complete, the Zoning Administrator shall refer the application to the Planning Commission for the next scheduled meeting and advertise a date for the public hearing by the Planning Commission. If not complete, the Zoning Administrator shall advise the applicant in writing why the application is not complete within ten (10) business days. 
3.  The Technical Review Committee shall review the application to insure compliance with the Master Plan and provide the Planning Commission with written comments. 
4.  The Planning Commission shall review the application, hold a public hearing, and approve, approve with modifications and/or conditions, or disapprove the application. Planning Commission approval of the Subdivision Concept Plan submitted with the PUD Master Plan shall be considered contingent upon City Council approval of the PUD Master Plan. 
5.  After Subdivision Concept Plan approval, the applicant shall then submit the Preliminary Plat, Road Construction Plans and Site Plans to the Technical Review Committee for approval. Final plats shall be submitted to the Plat Review Committee and the approved final plat shall be recorded in the RMC office and also filed with the Department Planning, Preservation and Sustainability and the Department of Public Service. 
(Ord. No. 2013-125, § 1, 11-6-13) 
Sec. 54-254. - Criteria for Review.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2011-45, § 1, adopted June 21, 2011, amended former Part. XI, §§ 54-266-54-273, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Part 11 pertained to the Commercial Corridor Design Review District. See the Zoning Ordinance Comparative Table for a listing of ordinances which have amended former Part. 11. 

Sec. 54-266. - Purpose for creating district. 
The purpose of the Design Review District is to establish a review process that will protect and improve the visual and aesthetic character and economic value of development within the City of Charleston. The City Council finds that excessive uniformity, dissimilarity, inappropriateness, or the poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of structures and signs, and the lack of proper attention to site design in the major commercial corridors of the city outside the Old and Historic District and Old City District hinders the harmonious development of the city, impairs the desirability of residence, investment or occupation in the city, limits the opportunity to attain the optimum use and value of land and improvements, adversely affects the stability and value of property, produces degeneration of property in such areas with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the peace, health and welfare of the city, and destroys a proper relationship between the taxable value of property and the cost of municipal services therefore. 
(Ord. No. 2011-45, § 1, 6-21-11) 
Sec. 54-267. - Design Review District objectives. 
(a)  Encourage originality, flexibility, and innovation in site planning and development, including the architecture, landscaping, and graphic design of said development; 
(b)  Discourage monotonous, drab, unsightly, dreary and inharmonious developments; 
(c)  Protect and enhance the appearance of development; 
(d)  Protect and enhance the city's natural beauty, visual character and charm by insuring that structures, signs, and other improvements are properly related to their sites, and to surrounding sites and structures, and that proper attention is given to the exterior appearance of structures, signs, and other improvements; 
(e)  Protect and enhance the city's appeal to residents and visitors and thus support and stimulate business and industry and promote the desirability of investment and occupancy in residential, commercial and industrial properties; 
(f)  Stabilize and improve property values and prevent blighted areas and, thus, increase tax revenues; 
(g)  Implement design guidelines that have been included in plans adopted by City Council and design policy statements adopted by the Design Review Board; 
(h)  Sustain the comfort, health, tranquility, and contentment of residents; and thus, promote and protect the peace, health and welfare of the city.

Sec. 54-272. - Design review standards. 
a.  The following standards shall be utilized by the board and the administrative officer in reviewing the plans, drawings, sketches and other documents required under Section 54-273. These standards are intended to provide a frame of reference for the applicant in the development of site and building plans as well as a method of review for the board and the administrative officer. These standards shall not be regarded as inflexible requirements. They are not intended to discourage creativity, invention, or innovation. The specification of one or more particular architectural styles is not included in these standards. These standards are not intended to affect the use of property or any by right entitlement of applicable zoning regulations, with the exception of the siting of development. 
1.  Building features and appearance. The shape, configuration, design, color, and types of material of proposed buildings, and/or alterations and additions to existing buildings, must establish an identifiable character for the development and not detract from neighboring properties. To this end, all elevations of a building must be in harmony one with another in terms of scale, proportion, detail, material, color, and design quality, and all buildings and accessory structures within a proposed development, including gasoline canopies, must be designed to create a harmonious whole. The use of loud, garish colors must be avoided except when the use of colors so characterized is essential for creating a successful design which complies with all other standards. 
Structures shall not dominate, in an incompatible way, any general development or adjacent building which is substantially in compliance with this article. This may be accomplished by the use of proper site design, architectural features, and/or landscaping to reduce the appearance of excessive and inappropriate height or mass of proposed structures. Long, monotonous facade designs including, but not limited to those characterized by unrelieved repetition of shape or form or by unbroken extension of line shall be avoided. Excessive ornamentation shall be avoided to prevent visual clutter. 
2.  Site design. The relationship of structures to their environment, and the location and design of driveways, parking, and circulation areas shall be given special consideration. Proposed structures shall be sited to relate harmoniously to the terrain and to existing structures in the vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed structures. The achievement of such relationship may include the enclosure of space in conjunction with other existing buildings or other proposed buildings, and the creation of focal points with respect to avenues of approach, terrain features, or other buildings. With respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives, and parking, special attention shall be given to location and number of access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient and, in so far as practicable, do not detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties. 
3.  Utility service. Whenever feasible, on-site electric, telephone, and other utility lines shall be underground. Any utility installations remaining above ground shall be located so as to have a harmonious relation to neighboring properties and the site. 
4.  Special features and accessory structures. Exposed storage areas, exposed machinery installations, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings, and structures and similar accessory areas and structures shall be subject to such design standards, setbacks, screen plantings, or other screening methods as shall reasonably be required to prevent their being incongruous with the existing or contemplated environment and the surrounding properties. 
5.  Signs. The shape, configuration, location, design, color, texture, lighting and materials of all exterior signs and outdoor advertising structures or features should not detract from the design of proposed or existing buildings and structures and the surrounding properties. 
6.  Application of design standards. The standards of review outlined in 54-27.2 a.1. through 5., shall also apply to all accessory buildings, structures, exterior signs and other site features, however related to the major buildings or structures. 
7.  In reviewing a proposed structure, specific consideration shall be given to its compatibility with adjacent structures where such structures are substantially in compliance with 54-27.2 a.1. through 5. 
8.  Application of Board policy statements. All design policy statements formally adopted by the Board shall be applied in reviewing the plans, drawings, sketches and other documents required under Section 54-273. 
b.  Neither the Board nor the administrative officer shall have the authority to waive or modify the site development requirements of this ordinance, or the requirements of any other applicable city ordinance. 
c.  Review authority granted by this ordinance shall only apply to exterior elements of developments.

1.  Right-Of-Way Design Modifications -Right-of-way narrowing devices including, but not limited to, curb extensions, bulbouts, neckdowns and corner bulges shall not be permitted unless approved by the Design Review Committee. Minimum right-of-way width may need to be increased to accommodate utilities. Thoroughfare types may be incorporated into a divided right-of-way design provided that the center median includes street trees and has a minimum width of 10' (width may include curb). 
2.  Travel Lanes -Travel lane width is designed for low to moderate vehicular speeds (25 MPH or less); higher vehicular speeds may require design modifications. Travel lane width is inclusive of the gutter and up to the face of the curb. 
3.  On-Street Parking -On-street parking may exist on both sides of Type 1, 2, 3 and 4 streets. On-street parking width is inclusive of the gutter and up to the face of the curb. For thoroughfares with high levels of parking usage and parking turnover (i.e. Type 1 GP Commercial Street) on-street parking lanes shall be increased to 8 feet. 
4.  Curb Radii -Curb radii are applicable to the face of curb and apply to street intersections, not driveway intersections. Curb radii are designed for low vehicular speeds; higher vehicular speeds may require design modifications. Rear alley intersection may incorporate a "driveway" intersection design rather than a curbed street design if approved by the Department of Public Service. 
5.  Street Trees -Street tree spacing may vary depending on tree species and development infrastructure. Street tree spacing shall be reviewed and approved by the Department of Parks at construction plan submittal. Street trees shall be installed prior to final plat approval and recordation. Tree wells are encouraged on the Type 1 GP Commercial Street. 
6.  Bicycle Travel -The Gathering Place District should provide opportunities for bicycle travel. A bicycle path is an independent bicycle way that is to be provided off-street and outside of the vehicular thoroughfare. A bicycle route shall be provided within the vehicular thoroughfare where suitable for shared use of bicycles and vehicles traveling at low speeds and may be indicated with the use of "sharrows". A bicycle lane is a dedicated marked lane with a moderate-speed vehicular thoroughfare. (See Figure 280:2) 
d.  Thoroughfare Design Flexibility. Gathering Place thoroughfare design standards may be modified to accommodate unique design elements that are project-specific provided that such modifications are made part of the official concept plan and are approved by the Planning Commission. The concept plan must show the proposed layout and corresponding right-of-way cross sections. Modified design standards shall not compromise thoroughfare right-of-way safety or function and must be able to provide appropriate locations for utilities. Modified design standards shall accommodate all required right-of-way components, shall provide appropriate pedestrian and vehicle mobility options and shall be designed to support adjacent future development.

This district authorizes neighborhoods that include a mix of uses to facilitate locating neighborhood services and workplaces in proximity to the primary users thereof. The district is intended to allow and encourage a variety of residential uses and to promote alternative modes of transportation by requiring interconnected street networks and pedestrian oriented designed streets. Density in the district is governed by location, if the district constitutes the base zoning of a property, and by the base zoning of a property, as applicable. 
(Ord. No. 2007-213, § 1, 11-20-07) 
Sec. 54-287. - Applicability and minimum neighborhood size. 
The Neighborhood District regulations shall apply to any undeveloped conservation, residentially or commercially zoned parcels that meet the minimum size requirements as set forth herein, and any parcels developed under Neighborhood District regulations. Each neighborhood shall be a minimum of thirty (30) net acres to include, outdoor space, streets and building lots, but excluding submerged land, jurisdictional freshwater wetlands and saltwater marsh. Parcels between ten (10) net acres and thirty (30) net acres may be developed as a Neighborhood District if the proposed property is physically connected and adjacent to an existing Neighborhood District. 
(Ord. No. 2007-213, § 1, 11-20-07) 
Sec. 54-288. - Approval of Neighborhood District plans and plats. 
Properties developed using Neighborhood District regulations shall be subdivided in accordance with a plan which covers the entire Neighborhood District area and has been granted concept plan approval by the Planning Commission.

Sec. 54-289. - Density. 
a.  As described in Section 54-286, this district is intended to promote mixed-use neighborhoods that provide a variety of housing options. Within the Neighborhood District, there are no minimum lot size requirements. Neighborhood density is based on net acreage and is allocated along a continuum, from more dense to less dense, depending on location: 
Higher Density Lower Density Adjacent or close to gathering place Adjacent or close to rural boundary line Has access to public transportation Located on two-lane highway  
b.  In base zoning districts, Neighborhood District densities are applied: 
Neighborhood District Code Neighborhood-Wide Density Existing Zoning Districts the Neighborhood District Matches Up With N-1 Up to 1 unit per acre SR-7 and C (Conservation) N-2 Up to 5 units per acre RR-1, SR-1, and SR-8 N-3 Up to 7 units per acre SR-2, SR-3, DR-3, DR-6, RO, and GO N-4 Up to 9 units per acre SR-4, SR-6, STR, and DR-9 N-5 Up to 20 units per acre SR-5, DR-1, DR-1F, DR-2, DR-2F, DR-12, CT, and LB N-6 20 + units per acre DR-4, GB and UC  
c.  Density distribution within a Neighborhood District: Each neighborhood shall have at least one center and an edge. A center is that part of the Neighborhood District where mixed uses are concentrated.

a.  Each building must front on a Neighborhood District street or outdoor space. 
b.  Building frontage requirements. Buildings shall be designed appropriately to address the corresponding neighborhood street type(s), outdoor space and neighborhood land use type. Buildings must front on a public street or outdoor space. Building frontage is the side of the building parallel to, or most closely parallel to the front property line. Neighborhood centers should be defined by building frontages, screen walls and landscaping and not by parking lots. 
c.  Build-to, height and frontage ratio requirements. There shall be no minimum requirements for side or rear setbacks with the exception that minimum building code standards must be met. Though every lot must have frontage on a neighborhood street or outdoor space, there shall be no minimum width requirement for lot frontage. There shall also be no maximum lot occupancy requirement. Front build-to, height and frontage ratio requirements of the Neighborhood District are based on the type of street a lot abuts. Front build-to, height and frontage ratio requirements, per street type, are: 
Street Type Front Build-To Zone 1 Height 2 Frontage Ratio 3 Type 1 0-5' 50' max. 90% min. Type 2 0-25' 31/2 stories 60% min. Type 3 0-25' 31/2 stories 60% min. Type 4 n/a 31/2 stories n/a Type 5 5' 31/2 stories n/a Type 6 25' min. 3 1/2 stories n/a  
1.  The front build-to zone is the area inside and across the lot measured from the front property line within which the building frontage must be placed. Building frontages may be placed anywhere within the front build-to zone. Buildings, including attached units in a continuous row, may be sited outside the required build-to zone, where necessary, for the preservation of natural features and grand trees (including grand tree protective zones) subject to approval by the Zoning Administrator. Utility easements shall not be permitted within the front build-to zone of lots fronting on Type 1 Streets. 
2.  The maximum height permitted for properties in a FEMA flood zone shall be the height allowed per street type measured from base flood elevation, provided the area below base flood elevation is floodproofed in nonresidential buildings. Ground floor parking shall count as a story. 
3.  The frontage ratio is the amount of building frontage as a proportion of the front line of the lot, exclusive of a front-loaded garage. Utility easements, side setbacks (maximum 12 feet for residential lots) for driveways, required buffers and grand trees (including grand tree protective zones) shall be excluded from the building frontage ratio calculations. 
d.  Corner lot requirements. On corner lots within the Neighborhood District mixed-use center(s), the building frontages shall be at least ninety (90) percent of the frontage on the primary street and no less twenty-five (25) percent on the secondary street with the remainder of the frontage on the secondary street being occupied by an appropriate screen wall. Fences or walls three (3) feet six (6) inches to six (6) feet zero (0) inches may count as building frontage, not to exceed twenty (20) percent of the building frontage ratio. On corner lots, the abutting building frontages must extend to the corner or have a corner entrance. Corner lots in areas other than the Neighborhood District center(s) shall not be required to meet building frontage requirements on the secondary street. 
e.  Driveway and alley requirements. The maximum driveway width for residential lots shall be ten (10) feet within the front ten (10) feet of a lot. Alleys are required for parking access to single-family detached units on lots having forty (40) feet of lot frontage or less, and on all, single-family attached, duplexes, triplexes, and quadroplexes. However, to encourage a mixture of residential building types on a Neighborhood District street the following exception may be allowed: 
-  When no more than three (3) lots with one of the aforementioned building types are planned in a block, the lots may be accessed by an 11-foot driveway instead of an alley. Lots with one duplex building may have two (2) driveways. Common parking areas for single-family attached, duplexes, triplexes and quadroplexes shall be located behind the building(s). 
f.  Parking requirements. There shall be no minimum parking requirements for residential uses in the Neighborhood District. All other uses in the Neighborhood District shall meet all parking requirements per Section 54-315 through Section 54-320 with the exception that up to twenty-five (25) percent of the required parking for multi-family residential or mixed uses may be non-hard surfaced utilizing slag, gravel, ROC, grasscrete or similar pervious material, subject to site plan approval. One hundred (100) percent of the required parking for designated outdoor spaces and amenity areas may be non-hard surfaced utilizing slag, gravel, ROC, grasscrete or similar pervious material, subject to site plan approval. 
g.  Lots fronting on outdoor space. Lots and buildings shall be permitted to have frontage on a defined outdoor space instead of a defined street type provided that the following requirements are satisfied:

Sec. 54-299.2. - Land uses. 
The permitted land uses in these districts are those listed under Article 2, Part 3, Table of Permitted Land Uses, in the column headings having the applicable district designation to wit: MU-1/WH or MU-2/WH, modified as follows: 
a.  Every development in the MU-1/WH or MU-2/WH zoning district that has five (5) or more residential units must include owner occupied workforce housing units and/or rental workforce housing units. Every development in the MU-1/WH or MU-2/WH zoning district that has less than five (5) units must include at least one (1) owner occupied or rental workforce housing unit or nonresidential use(s) that face the street on the ground level in accordance with the provisions of subsection b. 
b.  The number of owner occupied workforce housing units and/or rental workforce housing units per development shall be the greater of: (1) one unit; or (2) twenty (20%) percent of the number of residential units in the development, rounded up to the next whole number, whichever is greater. The workforce housing units shall be sized, in terms of square footage and number of bedrooms, comparable and proportional to the square footage and number of bedrooms of the market rate units in the development as a whole. The smallest workforce housing unit by bedroom count shall not be smaller than the smallest market rate unit with the same number of bedrooms. The workforce housing units shall be integrated and intermixed within the market rate units in a development and not clustered together or segregated from the market rate units. Developments that contain multiple buildings shall incorporate in each building workforce housing units comparable and in proportion, square footage and bedroom wise, to the number of market rate units in the building. Exterior finishes of workforce housing units shall be the same type and quality as the development's market rate units. 
Developments that do not include owner occupied and/or rental workforce housing units must dedicate the greater of: (1) fifty (50%) percent of the square footage of the ground level or one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet for nonresidential uses. Nonresidential uses in the MU-1/WH district are the nonresidential uses allowable in the Limited Business (LB) district, and nonresidential uses in the MU-2/WH district are the nonresidential uses allowable in the General Business (GB) district. 
c.  Fee payment in lieu of units (rental units only): In lieu of providing on site rental workforce housing units, a developer may choose to contribute a fee, on a per unit basis, to the City's Affordable/Workforce Housing Account for any or all of the number of workforce housing units required for the development. 
The fee, per unit, shall be a sum equal to the number of gross square footage in the development, whether residential, retail, commercial or otherwise, and inclusive of all heated and unheated spaces (but excluding parking garages) multiplied by $5.10, then divided by the number of required workforce units in the development. Square footage initially used solely as a grocery store or pharmacy may be excluded from gross square footage for purposes of calculating the fee; provided however, if at any time during the period of twenty-five (25) years after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development, the use of the square footage as a grocery store or pharmacy lapses for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, or is utilized for any other purpose, the then owner of the development shall be required, as a condition of occupancy of such space, to pay a sum equal to the difference between fee per unit that would have been payable had the space not been excluded from the per unit calculation and the fee per unit initially. 
Fees shall be calculated at the time of building permit application, and paid in full prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any part of the project. 
d.  Land donation in lieu of units: Upon approval of City Council, and in its sole discretion, land may be donated to the City for Workforce Housing to satisfy some or all of workforce housing units required by the development. The size, configuration and location of any land proposed for donation shall be capable and appropriately zoned to support, at minimum, the number of units it is intended to replace, and is subject to the sole approval of City Council, which may be withheld for any or no reason. Should the City elect to accept a land donation in lieu of construction of units, the developer shall be wholly responsible for the costs of acquisition of the land and transfer to the City, including but not limited to costs of surveys, plats, environmental investigation, title insurance, City attorneys' fees and recording costs. Title to the land proposed for donation shall be transferred to the City prior to the issuance of a building permit for any part of the development. 
e.  Prior to receiving a building permit for any portion of a development, the owner thereof shall provide, in writing, to the satisfaction of the City of Charleston Department of Housing and Community Development, or its successor, information identifying the total number of one bedroom units, two bedroom units, etc., and the respective square footages of the same, the total number of one bedroom workforce housing units, two bedroom workforce housing units, etc., and the respective square footages of the same, and the location of the workforce housing units in the development. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any portion of a development, the owner thereof shall identify, in writing, to the City of Charleston Department of Housing and Community Development, or its successor, the units designated as owner occupied workforce housing units and/or rental workforce housing units. 
f.  i.  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any portion of a development, the owner shall execute covenants satisfactory to the City that identifies the owner occupied workforce housing units and/or rental workforce housing units and which restrict such units to occupancy, and if applicable ownership, by qualified households for a period of no less than twenty-five (25) years, and submit a copy of the recorded covenants to the City of Charleston Department of Housing and Community Development, or its successor. 
ii.  As for the owner occupied workforce housing units, the covenants shall identify the initial maximum allowable sales price, and provide that the initial maximum allowable sales price may be adjusted annually for inflation based on the increase in the area median income (AMI) or Consumer Price Index, whichever is greater. Each owner of such units, prior to initial occupancy, shall be required to submit to the City of Charleston Department of Housing and Community Development, or its successor, a verified income report of household income of all members of the household. The covenants shall require notice to the City of Charleston Department of Housing and Community Development, or its successor, of any transfer of the owner occupied workforce housing units and verification that the purchaser is a qualified household. Owner occupied workforce housing units shall be subject to resale restrictions for no fewer than twenty-five (25) years from date of initial sale of the property. Such restrictions will be recorded as deed restrictions. 
iii.  As for rental workforce housing units, the covenants shall require the owner to provide proof to the City of Charleston Department of Housing and Community Development, or its successor, at inception of every tenancy, and on an annual basis thereafter, that no more than affordable rent is being charged for the unit(s), and verified income reports of household income of all occupants of rental workforce housing units. Rental workforce housing units shall be subject to these restrictions for no fewer than twenty-five (25) years from the initial occupancy as workforce housing. 
iv.  The covenants for rental workforce housing units shall provide: 
If a workforce housing unit is converted from rental occupied to owner occupied occupancy during the term of the rental workforce housing covenants, the unit shall be subject to the owner occupied workforce housing unit requirements as set out in subsection f (ii) (to include an Initial Maximum Sales Price) for a term of months equal to the number resulting when subtracting from 300 months the number of months the unit has been subject to rental workforce housing covenants. 
Conversion of a workforce housing unit from owner occupied to renter occupied occupancy shall not be permitted. 
Covenants shall require written notice to the City prior to any conversion taking place. 
g.  The covenants shall accord the City of Charleston, or its assignee, rights to enforcement by any legal and/or equitable means, including the revocation of a certificate of occupancy, and in all events be subject to approval by corporation counsel. 
h.  If the development is to be phased, each phase shall include workforce housing units concurrently with the market rate units in the particular phase. A phasing plan that brings the workforce housing units on line at the end of build out is not permitted. 
i.  The upkeep of rental workforce housing units shall be of the same quality as the upkeep of the other market rate rental units of the development.

a.  Section 54-299.2 (b): First paragraph: the number of owner occupied workforce housing units, and/or rental workforce housing units, shall be no less than fifteen (15%) percent of the number of units in the development, rounded up to the next whole number. 
b.  Section 54-299.2 (c): Fee payment in lieu of workforce rental units is optional. If the fee in lieu option is selected, the fee, per unit shall be a sum equal to the number of gross square footage in the development, whether residential, retail, commercial or otherwise, and inclusive of all heated and unheated spaces (but excluding parking garages) multiplied by $3.40, then divided by the number of required workforce units in the development (calculated at a 15% requirement). Square footage initially used solely as a grocery store or pharmacy may be excluded from gross square footage for purposes of calculating the fee; provided however, if at any time during the period of twenty-five (25) years after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development, the use of the square footage as a grocery store or pharmacy lapses for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, or is utilized for any other purpose, the then owner of the development shall be required, as a condition of occupancy of such space, to pay a sum equal to the difference between fee per unit that would have been payable had the space not been excluded from the per unit calculation and the fee per unit initially paid. 
If a certificate of occupancy has been issued for the development or applicable phase, the fee per unit shall be prorated to account for the number of months the unit has already been subject to rental workforce housing covenants.

PART 17 - UPPER PENINSULA DISTRICT[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-142, § 1, adopted October 13, 2015, added a new Part 17, §§ 54-300-54-312. Inasmuch as these sections already exist in Article 3, to avoid duplication of section numbers, these sections have been renumbered as §§ 54-299.21-54-299.33 at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 54-299.21. - Findings. 
Numerous studies and plans suggest the area of the Peninsula lying generally to the east of Interstate 26 and north of Huger Street (Upper Peninsula District) is well suited for greater density and increased building height due to its connectivity to major transportation routes such as I-26, Highway 17, Highway 52 and Highway 78, the expansive nature of its existing infrastructure and its relatively sparse population as compared to other areas of the Peninsula. The character of the Upper Peninsula District is distinct and different from other areas of the Peninsula in that there is not a predominance of historic buildings, thus presenting an opportunity for buildings to be sized and designed in a manner that incorporates architectural features characteristic to Charleston but which also take advantage of the geographic features of the area, as the potential for views of both the Ashley and Cooper Rivers exist. After receiving valuable input from various sectors of the public, including residents, neighborhood leaders, area businesses and nonprofit groups, preservation organizations, developers, real estate professionals, designers and green building experts, City Council finds it to be in the public interest that this area of the Peninsula be developed in a manner that reflects the built environment, makes advantageous use of technology to protect the natural environment and which provides opportunities for diverse housing and commercial activities. 
(Ord. No. 2015-142, § 1, 10-13-2015) 
Sec. 54-299.22. - Purpose. 
The purpose of the Upper Peninsula District is to preserve the character and quality of the existing residential neighborhoods and to accommodate responsible growth and redevelopment through the use of incentives designed to promote and protect the built and natural environments. 
(Ord. No. 2015-142, § 1, 10-13-2015)

(d)  Each point approved may only be redeemed once. 
(e)  Owners may choose to implement incentive options onsite in advance of development, allowing for projects to be phased. Any preexisting incentive options will still be verified for compliance. 
(f)  Each incentive option has its own specific requirements regarding where on the site the option may be implemented as some are building specific and some are site specific; please refer to each individual section for this information. 
(g)  Each incentive option has its own specific requirements regarding how its points may be redeemed on the site as some are building specific and some are site specific; please refer to each individual section for this information. 
(h)  All incentive options used toward height and/or density bonuses shall remain in place and be maintained for the life of the building utilizing the bonus, unless otherwise noted. 
1)  Stormwater Management. Urban landscapes often feature expansive areas of impervious surfaces such as roadways, parking lots, sidewalks and rooftops that increase surface runoff and reduce infiltration. Management of stormwater as close to its source as possible by way of low impact development infiltration techniques recharges the water table via infiltration and reduces stormwater runoff. Reducing stormwater runoff lessens the amount of water entering the City's stormwater system, thus reducing the potential for flooding issues and the demand on City infrastructure. Low impact development systems recreate the predevelopment site hydrology through site design techniques that promote storage, infiltration, evaporation, and treatment of stormwater runoff onsite. Low impact development can be both an aesthetically pleasing and a functional way of managing stormwater at the source. 
Requirements: Decrease Stormwater Runoff and Impervious Surfaces 
For two (2) points, design, construct, and maintain low impact development stormwater management systems that handle rainfall onsite, and prevent the offsite discharge of at least one (1) inch of stormwater runoff from the site's total area. Impervious surfaces shall not exceed sixty five (65%) percent of the surface area of the entire site. 
For purposes hereof, impervious surfaces means a surface that does not allow water to penetrate. Examples of impervious surfaces include asphalt, rooftops and concrete. For purposes hereof, all other surfaces shall be considered pervious surfaces. 
The design, construction and maintenance of the system shall adhere to the recommendations of the Guide, a copy of which is available in the Department of Planning, Preservation and Sustainability (hereafter the "Department"). Approved systems include, but are not limited to, bioretention cells, permeable pavement, stormwater infiltration, vegetated green roofs, rainwater harvesting and impervious surface disconnection. 
No more than two (2) points per site may be awarded for this incentive option. 
General requirements 
(a)  The design of all low impact development systems shall follow the specifications and guidelines listed in the Guide, to include specifications pertaining to contaminated soils and guidelines for plant selection and installation. Runoff reduction rates provided for the Coastal Zone Credit Approach as outlined in the Guide will be recognized for meeting the prevention of the above offsite discharge requirement. 
(b)  The creation of wetlands, open channels and surface retention or detention facilities (i.e. ponds), as defined in the Guide, are not permitted. 
(c)  All low impact development systems shall have appropriate stormwater educational signage, approved by the Department and any applicable review boards, displayed in a prominent location. 
(d)  Owners availing themselves of this incentive shall be required to sign a Maintenance and Operation Agreement which, among other things, will require continued maintenance of the system and a yearly inspection and report on the condition and functionality of the system by an engineer licensed by the State of South Carolina, the cost of which shall be borne by the property owner. Any deficiencies revealed by the inspection shall be corrected in a timeframe established by the City. The Agreement shall be in recordable form, and at the option of the City, may be recorded in the RMC Office for Charleston County. The City may choose to perform additional inspections at its discretion at no cost to the property owner. 
(e)  Certificate of occupancy. If the committed points in this category are not achieved, the owner shall be required to substitute incentive options and earn all points necessary to justify bonuses before a certificate of occupancy will be issued.

PART 2 - OLD CITY HEIGHT DISTRICTS AND VIEW CORRIDOR PROTECTION 

Sec. 54-305. - Applicability of requirements for Old City Height District. 
a.  Defined. The Old City Height District includes all of peninsular Charleston lying south of Mt. Pleasant Street, and the extension thereof across the entire peninsula, as described on the map adopted as part of ordinance #1978-80 establishing the Old City Height District. 
b.  In any zone district, the maximum heights of buildings or structures, the minimum setbacks, courts and other open spaces, the area of lot required per family housed thereon and the percent of lot to be occupied by buildings shall be as shown on Table 3.1: Height, Area and Setback Regulations, as modified by special provisions, exceptions, conditions and general regulations contained elsewhere herein; provided, however, that the requirements set forth in Article 3: Part 2, for the Old City Height District shall prevail over Table 3.1 to the extent that they conflict with said Table, but in all other respects, the accompanying Table shall apply in all zone districts. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, heights of buildings and structures on properties located in the Tech Corridor (TC) overlay zone and the Old City Height District shall be governed by the provisions of Section 54-229.1.d. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, heights of buildings and structures on properties located in the Upper Peninsula (UP) District and the Old City Height District shall be governed by the provisions of Section 54-300. 
(Ord. No. 2014-125, § 2, 9-23-2014; Ord. No. 2015-142, § 12, 10-13-2015) 
Sec. 54-306. - Old City Height Districts. 
The requirements of this section have resulted from a contextual study of building height and architectural patterns in the Old City Height District. The requirements of this section reflect the predominant building height trends of the areas to which they are applied, and reinforce the principles cited in the Downtown Plan, adopted in 1999, that higher structures be located along spine streets of the Peninsula, with heights of structures tapering down towards the waters' edges. The requirements of this Section are intended to clarify acceptable heights of buildings in areas of the Old City Height District, subject to the right of the Board of Architectural Review to adjust heights in limited circumstances when based on architectural merit. 
General requirements: 
1.  Heights shall be measured in stories or feet, as specified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, height shall be measured in feet in the following districts: 3X, 85/200, 85/125, 85/30, 100/30, 80/30, 55/30S, 55/30, 56/30V, 120/30, 50W, W and WP. 
2.  For maximum height specified in feet, the measurement shall be taken from the highest curb elevation adjacent to the site to the highest point of the structure. For maximum height specified in stories, the measurement shall be taken from the main floor finished elevation. 
3.  Where heights are specified in stories or feet, the measurement shall be from finished floor to finished floor. 
4.  If a building is required to be raised per FEMA requirements, that same height shall be added to the maximum height allowed, up to a maximum of six feet. This measurement shall be taken from the highest curb elevation. 
5.  Any area under a structure in excess of six feet shall be counted as a story. 
6.  The BAR is empowered to require a downward adjustment of one-half story in the number of stories based on the number of stories of structures that predominate in the structure's immediate surroundings, as defined in Section 54-231. 
7.  Floors shall be measured in the following manner: 
i.  The maximum height of any residential floor shall be 12 feet, unless otherwise specified. Any dimension above this shall constitute a second floor. The BAR may grant a waiver up to 14 feet on the first or second floor, based on architectural merit and context. 
ii.  The minimum height of any residential floor shall not be less than 10 feet; however, there is no minimum height for floors in a single family residence, duplex or townhouse. 
iii.  The maximum height of any nonresidential story shall be 20 feet, unless otherwise specified. Any dimension above this height shall constitute a second floor. The BAR may grant a waiver up to 25 feet on the main floor based on architectural merit and context. 
iv.  The minimum height of any nonresidential floor shall not be less than 14 feet, unless otherwise specified. 
v.  The BAR is empowered to require downward adjustments to floor heights, based on context of the structure with its immediate surroundings, as defined in Section 54-231. 
8.  Half stories shall be permitted as specified by zone. Half stories shall constitute a maximum 50% habitable use of the attic space or 50 percent of the buildable area, whichever is less. For purposes of this section, in nonresidential structures, a half-story means an area no larger than 50 percent of the footprint of the structure, regardless of whether that area is under a roof or not. For purposes of this section, in single family residences, duplexes or townhomes, a half-story means finished attic space under a sloping roof. 
9.  Building height to roof eave shall not exceed twice the building width of the primary façade of habitable space fronting the street; provided Board of Architectural Review may waive this provision based on architectural merit and context. 
10.  There shall be no minimum building height requirement, unless required by the applicable height district. 
11.  Appurtenances to a building shall not be permitted to exceed the maximum height, unless otherwise specified. 
12.  If any portion of a structure subject to the jurisdiction of the BAR is within fifty (50) feet of an existing structure rated "exceptional" (Group 1) or "excellent" (Group 2) on the Historic Architecture Inventory, adopted by Section 54-235, or a structure in the Landmark Overlay district, such portion of that structure shall not exceed the height of such existing structures unless approved by the Board of Architectural Review based on architectural merit and context. 
13.  Mechanical equipment on a roof shall be visually screened from the street with parapets or other types of visual screens of the minimum height necessary to conceal the same. 
14.  Additional buildings that are not accessory buildings, additions to buildings, and accessory buildings that include dwelling units that are subject to the jurisdiction of the BAR shall be subordinate in height, scale and mass to the existing building; provided this provision may be waived by the Board of Architectural Review when it deems such appropriate based on architectural merit and context or existing lot conditions. 
15.  Parking garages shall not exceed the height of the principal building on the site. Parking garages shall not be constrained by floor to floor height requirements, but stand-alone parking garages shall appear from the street to conform to the number of stories permitted in the height district in which it is located. 
16.  In the height districts where additional height may be awarded on the basis of architectural merit and context, if the property is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Architectural Review, the owner requesting the additional height must submit the plans to the Board of Architectural Review for review and approval. 
17.  An applicant seeking a height rezoning shall only be able to request a rezoning to the next higher height district. 
18.  An applicant requesting additional height as may be authorized per the applicable height district shall adhere to submittal requirements as adopted by the Board of Architectural Review. 
19.  Communication towers shall not exceed the maximum building height limits of districts that include a maximum height limit in feet, or a height limit equal to 10 feet per story for districts that do not specify a maximum height in feet. 
20.  "Architectural merit" means a project that reflects exemplary architectural and urban design, utilizes the highest level of materials and finishes and contributes to the public realm.

Height District 56/30 V. 
In this district: 
1.  FEMA Velocity Zone regulations impose significant restrictions on the developable volume of properties that fall within its influence, and are particularly restrictive regarding street-level development. The success of the traditional urban fabric of Charleston is highly dependent upon the activation of the public realm, and street-level uses are a key element of this activity. The 56/30V Height District is intended to encourage a continuation of Charleston's urban traditions by providing incentive for development of street-level activity within FEMA Velocity Zones. 
2.  No part of a structure shall exceed the height of fifty-six (56) feet unless permitted as a result of the following clauses, nor shall any principal structure be lower than thirty (30) feet. 
3.  Allowances for additional enclosed habitable space above fifty-six (56) feet but not to exceed a height of seventy (70) feet shall be permitted when the development in question provides for contributory occupation of the ground floor at the street frontage(s) of the property. Such contributory occupation must be designed to abide by FEMA requirements for development in Velocity Zones as approved by the city's Floodplain Administrator. For every square foot of approved contributory occupation of the ground floor, the development will be permitted an equivalent square foot of habitable space above fifty-six (56) feet, up to a limit of twenty-five (25) percent of the total rooftop area. Contributory occupation is defined as any activity that is deemed by the Zoning Administrator to be consistent with and supportive of the goal of street-level activation within the FEMA V-Zone. Such activity might include, but is not limited to: outdoor dining (covered or open-air), temporary shops or merchant stands; manned vending carts; green spaces (physically open to the sky); building access stairs or lobbies, storefront displays, etc. In addition, the areas dedicated to contributory occupation must be located with a majority of its frontage on the street or public sidewalk, and must be specifically designed to support contributory occupation. Under no circumstances will parking, mechanical or storage areas be considered contributory occupation. 
4.  Allowances for additional height above fifty-six (56) feet but not to exceed seventy (70) feet may be permitted for architectural features such as parapets, towers, pergolas, or other roof elements, and mechanical rooms, elevator penthouses and stair towers. Mechanical rooms, elevator penthouses and stair towers must be designed as integrated architectural elements. The design of such features is further limited as follows: they shall not contain enclosed habitable spaces (unless such habitable spaces are permitted as a result of the previous clause); the total rooftop occupation (including allowed enclosed habitable spaces and uninhabitable architectural features) shall not exceed 50 percent of the total rooftop area; the existence and design of any such features is subject to review and approval of the Board of Architectural Review. 
5.  Notwithstanding the above, no portion of a structure, which structure is within fifty (50) feet of an existing building rated "exceptional" (Group 1) or "excellent" (Group 2) on the Historic Architecture Inventory adopted by Section 54-235 shall exceed the height of such existing building unless approved by the Board of Architectural Review.

2.  All portions of a structure above the seventy (70) foot height level shall set back at least thirty (30) feet from all street right-of-way lines. 
3.  All principal structures fifty (50) feet or less in height shall have no set back from street right-of-way lines, subject to provisions of Article 3: Part 10; except such structures may be set back from street right-of-way a distance no greater than the least such set back of the two adjoining buildings on either side. 
4.  Notwithstanding the above, no portion of a structure, which structure is within fifty (50) feet of an existing building rated "exceptional" (Group 1) or "excellent" (Group 2) on the Historic Architecture Inventory adopted by Section 54-235 shall exceed the height of such existing buildings unless approved by the Board of Architectural Review.

    The maximum width of driveways, and the minimum curb radius shall be based upon the speed limit of the street to which the driveway is to be connected, and shall be as shown on Table 3.2. Driveways shall be a minimum distance of 50 feet from the intersection of the right-of-way lines to the edge of driveways. The distance between the proposed driveway and an existing adjacent driveway shall be the greatest distance feasible. For parcels with a right-of-way frontage equal to or less than 130-feet in length the development is limited to one driveway and for parcels with a frontage greater than130-feet in length the development may have multiple driveways, but no more than three driveways. For parcels with a right-of-way frontage equal to less than 130-feet in length, two single lane driveways may be allowed if the inbound drive is upstream from the outbound drive. In cases of new development and/or redevelopment, the driveways shall be located in a manner where they can be shared between parcels, if feasible. See Figures 3.1 and 3.2 for an illustration of how to measure these dimensions.

PART 4 - OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 54-315. - Intent. 
The purpose of this section is to establish minimum requirements for off-street parking based on the typical needs of various types of land uses, the pattern of development in the city, and the physical characteristics of the land and environment in the Charleston area. 
Sec. 54-316. - Applicability of requirements. 
At the time any building, structure, or outdoor commercial space (a use not utilizing a structure) is constructed, reused, enlarged, or increased in capacity by the addition of dwelling units, guest rooms, floor area, or seats, the required number of off-street automobile parking spaces with adequate provisions for ingress and egress by an automobile of standard size shall be provided for the new or enlarged use(s) pursuant to Table 3.3. Properties within the GP zoning district shall be exempt from all provisions of Part 4: Off-Street Parking Requirements, with the exception of Section 54-317, subsection b. relating to the maximum area of paved parking spaces and aisles. 
Applications for determining compliance with parking requirements shall include a scaled site plan, showing the existing and proposed location of structures, trees, monuments, signs, and other improvements, and the location of existing and proposed parking. Applications may be subject to the requirements under Article 6: Site Plan Review (Technical Review Committee), where applicable.

a.  Protection of Grand Trees. The removal, relocation, destruction or abuse in any manner of any grand tree (24? or greater D.B.H., excluding pine trees and sweetgum trees) is prohibited on any parcel of non-exempt land unless a variance, special exception, or staff approval has been obtained pursuant to Section 54-329. For subdivisions, the siting of a lot so as to place a grand tree at or near the center of a lot in a location that will require the removal of the grand tree for construction of a dwelling unit, shall be prohibited. 
b.  Protected Trees Prior to Development. Where a building permit or subdivision approval has not been issued, the removal, relocation, destruction or abuse in any manner of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the protected trees (8? or greater D.B.H.) on any one (1) parcel of non-exempt land within any five (5) year period shall be prohibited. The total number of protected trees existing on any one parcel shall not be reduced below a total number equal to fifteen (15) protected trees per acre. 
c.  Protected trees during or after development. The removal, relocation, destruction or abuse in any manner of protected trees required to be saved by this Chapter is prohibited. For parcels of land proposed for development, a minimum number of protected trees on the entire parcel equal to fifteen (15) protected trees per acre shall be saved. For parcels containing less than fifteen (15) protected trees per acre, the total number of protected trees required to be saved shall equal the total number of protected trees existing on the parcel. Grand trees to be saved may be used to calculate the total number of protected trees to be saved. 
d.  Protection of Tree Colonnades and Allees. The removal, relocation, destruction or abuse in any manner of any protected tree within a colonnade or allee is prohibited on any parcel of non-exempt land. For the purpose of this ordinance, a colonnade or allee is defined as any two (2) or more parallel rows of trees of the same species with a minimum of four (4) trees total and a minimum of two (2) trees measuring twenty inches (20?) or greater D.B.H., except for pine trees and parallel rows of trees with a public right-of-way in the center which are exempt from this definition. 
e.  This Ordinance shall not restrict the ability of the City of Charleston, public utilities, and electric suppliers from maintaining safe clearance around utility lines. 
f.  The area of existing utility and drainage easements may be subtracted from the total site area for the purpose of calculating the number of protected trees required to be saved. 
g.  The following standards shall apply regarding the removal and disposal of trees and vegetation associated with land development approved by the Subdivision Review Committee and/or the Technical Review Committee: 
Definitions. For the purpose of this subsection, the following items shall be defined as follows:

All other tree surveys shall be prepared by a landscape architect, surveyor or engineer registered in South Carolina and shall have an accuracy of plus or minus three feet ( 3'); 
2.  Limits of areas proposed to be clearcut for proposed structures, improvements, rights-of-way, and easements. Clearcutting beyond the limits as shown on the plat or site plan shall not be permitted. 
3.  A tree protection plan showing how grand trees located in development areas are to be protected during development in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 54-330. 
Sec. 54-329. - Standards for approval to remove trees. 
a.  The removal of a protected tree, that is not a grand tree, in violation of the standards set forth in Section 54-327 shall be approved if the Zoning Administrator finds that one or more of the following conditions exist. Trees removed under the following conditions shall require replacement with two (2), two and one-half inch (21/2?) caliper recommended trees (see Appendix A). This section shall not apply to grand trees. 
1.  The protected tree is located at least twenty-five feet (25') away from the property line and where a proposed building or accessory structure is to be placed in accordance with other City standards; or 
2.  The protected tree creates unsafe vision on a public street or right-of-way as defined by Section 54-351. 
3.  The protected tree has a D.B.H. of eight inches (8?) to fifteen inches (15?), is located at least twenty-five feet (25') from the property line within a parking lot providing no more than the maximum number of hard surfaced parking spaces allowed by this chapter, and the Zoning Administrator determines that no other design alternative exists to save the tree. 
b.  Removal of a grand tree shall require approval of a variance, except for grand trees listed under category III or category IV in Section 54-331 which shall require approval of a special exception where the Board finds that the grand tree is in poor health, that removal of the grand tree will allow protection of a specimen tree, as defined herein, which would otherwise be removed if the grand tree is saved, or that the grand tree is located within a proposed building footprint, street, road, driveway, drainage way, or parking area and no other reasonable design or economically reasonable alternative exists to save the tree. 
c.  Each protected or grand tree that is determined by the Zoning Administrator to be hazardous, diseased or injured to the extent it is irreparably damaged shall be approved for removal. The burden of providing proof of the extent of the hazard, disease or injury shall rest with the applicant, who must provide documentation from a qualified arborist. When there is a question of tree hazard, the Zoning Administrator may require documentation, including strength loss calculations for the portion of the tree creating the hazard, from an arborist who has been certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or who is otherwise qualified. Each live tree which is approved for removal shall require replacement with one (1) recommended tree of an equivalent species. 
d.  Each protected or grand tree that is determined by the Zoning Administrator to be causing structural damage to a habitable building where said damage cannot be remedied without removing the tree shall be approved for removal. When there is a question of whether tree removal is necessary, the Zoning Administrator may require documentation from an arborist who is certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or, who is otherwise qualified, that said damage cannot be successfully halted through root pruning and installation of a root barrier while maintaining the structural integrity of the tree. Each tree removed shall require replacement with one (1) recommended tree of an equivalent species. 
(Ord. No. 2002-19, § 5, 2-12-02) 
Sec. 54-330. - Tree protection requirements. 
a.  Protective Barricades Required. Protective barricades shall be placed around all protected trees and grand trees located in development areas, and designated to be saved, prior to the start of development activities, and shall remain in place until development activities are complete or construction in accordance with standards set forth in this Section commences. The area within the protective barricade shall remain free of all building materials, dirt or other construction debris, vehicles and development activities. Barricades shall be erected at a minimum distance from the base of protected trees and grand trees according to the following standards: 
1.  For Protected Trees Twenty-Three Inches (23?) or Less D.B.H. Protective barricades shall be placed a minimum distance of ten feet (10') from the base of each protected tree; and 
2.  For Protected Trees Greater Than Twenty-Three Inches ( 23?) D.B.H. and Grand Trees. Protective barricades shall provide a diameter of protection around the tree equal in feet to the diameter breast height of the tree (i.e., a 24? diameter tree would require a 24-foot diameter protective barricade). 
b.  Construction within the protective barricade. Changes in grade or construction of impervious surface or utilities within the required protected barricade shall be permitted subject to the following guidelines: 
1.  Changes in grade or construction within protected zones must be approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to beginning construction. Plans must be submitted which illustrate in detail protective measures necessary as described in Section 2.10 of Erosion and Sediment Control Practices for Developing Areas by the South Carolina Land Resources Conservation Commission, Erosion and Sediment Control Division; and 
2.  A minimum setback, to be determined using the following guidelines, shall be maintained between impervious surfaces and the bases of all protected and grand trees, except where the zoning administrator finds that a proposed encroachment of an impervious surface will not adversely affect a tree, or that special construction methods and tree care, including but not limited to mulching, root pruning, soil aeration, and fertilization/bio-stimulant treatment, will reduce the potential for adversely affecting a tree: 
(a)  Trees of eight inches (8?) to sixteen inches (16?) D.B.H.: a minimum clearance of eight feet ( 8') is required. 
(b)  Trees of seventeen inches (17?) to twenty-three inches (23?) D.B.H.: a minimum clearance of ten feet (10') is required. 
(c)  Grand Trees: a minimum clearance of twelve feet is required, plus an additional one foot (1') of clearance for every three D.B.H. inches (3?) in excess of twenty-four (24) (i.e., a tree having a D.B.H. of thirty-six inches [36?] must have a minimum clearance of sixteen feet [16'] between its base and any impervious surface). 
c.  All roots outside the protective barricade to be removed during development shall be severed clean and a two inch (2?) layer of mulch shall be applied over the surface of exposed roots during development. 
d.  All pruning of protected trees and grand trees shall be done by a qualified tree service during development according to the National Arborists Association, Pruning Standards for Shade Trees. 
(Ord. No. 2002-19, §§ 6, 7, 2-12-02)

For existing trees, the Board of Zoning Appeals-Site Design is authorized to grant variances or special exceptions to allow their removal as specified in Section 54-327 and 54-329, and to require the planting of replacement trees of at least two and one-half inches (21/2?) caliper measured at six inches (6?) above grade with the total caliper inches per removed tree not to exceed the amount specified in Section 54-331.b. 
2.  For trees removed unlawfully, without approval, the Board of Zoning Appeals-Site Design is authorized to grant after-the-fact approval, and require mitigation for trees removed with replacement trees of at least two and one-half inches (21/2?) caliper measured at six inches (6?) above grade. The total caliper inches, type and size of replacement trees required by the Board shall be based on the health and specimen quality of the tree(s) removed, the site specific conditions, and the factual circumstances under which the tree was removed. For trees removed unlawfully from a single-family zoned lot or a lot used exclusively for a single-family home, the Board is authorized to require up to three (3) times the total D.B.H. of the tree(s) removed in caliper inches of replacement trees and the minimum size of the replacement trees to be planted on-site shall be four inches (4?) caliper. For trees removed unlawfully from all other properties, the Board is authorized to require up to ten (10) times the total D.B.H. of the tree(s) removed in caliper inches of replacement trees and the minimum size of the replacement trees to be planted on-site shall be four inches (4?) caliper. 
3.  In all cases, the Board is authorized to require up to fifty (50) percent of the total caliper inches of replacement trees to be planted off-site at a location in the general area of where the tree removal(s) occurred, and to allow off-site replacement to be accomplished through a contribution to the City of Charleston Street Tree Planting Program in an amount equivalent to the City's cost for the type, size and number of trees to be planted off-site. 
4.  In certain circumstances, the Board may require mitigation for trees removed in the form of specific arboricultural services to be rendered to remaining trees on the site. 
b.  Mitigation Requirements. The Board is authorized, upon the granting of a variance or special exception for removal of a grand tree, to require mitigation with replacement trees.

PART 8 - LANDSCAPE BUFFER REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 54-344. - Intent. 
All subdivisions, residential or otherwise, and site improvements shall require the installation of landscape buffers pursuant to this Article. Existing buffers which satisfy the requirements of this Article, either partially or completely, shall be maintained. Proposed improvements to properties developed prior to this Article shall only require buffer improvements for the section(s) of the lot being improved, unless the cost of the proposed building additions and site improvements exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the current value of the existing land and improvements thereon, in which case the entire lot shall be brought into compliance with landscape buffer requirements of this Article. 
Sec. 54-345. - Applicability of requirements. 
Landscape buffer requirements listed herein shall apply to all real property within the City limits of Charleston. 
Sec. 54-346. - Plan review and approval requirements. 
Whenever any property is affected by these landscape buffer requirements, the property owner or developer shall submit a plan for review and approval by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall follow the requirements of this Article in approving or disapproving any plan required herein. 
a.  The contents of the plan shall include the following: 
1.  Dimensions and acreage of each lot or plot or portion thereof to be built upon or otherwise used; 
2.  Layout of the entire project, including the proposed uses of all buildings and their relationship to surrounding properties; 
3.  Layout of all off-street parking and loading areas, including the location of entry and exit points, the internal vehicular circulation pattern and the location and dimension of required parking and loading spaces; 
4.  Location and dimensions of existing and proposed streets and highways; 
5.  Location, name (botanical and common), size and spacing of all existing plant materials to be retained and proposed plantings and screenings. The plan shall clearly distinguish between existing plant materials to be retained and proposed plantings; 
6.  Location of walls, fences and railings and an indication of their height and construction materials; 
7.  Details illustrating landscaping installation; and 
8.  Title; north arrow; scale, names of owner, developer and person responsible for plan preparation; and the date that the plan was drawn, including subsequent revision dates. 
b.  No building permit shall be issued until the required landscaping plan has been submitted and approved, and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the landscaping is completed as certified by an on-site inspection by the Zoning Administrator. 
Sec. 54-347. - Landscape buffer requirements. 
Buffers are landscaped areas of varying depths intended to separate and screen incompatible land uses from one another or provide green areas along major roadways and rivers, and in some instances, screen development entirely from roadways or rivers. 
a.  Generally 
1.  Buffers shall vary in depth and in landscaping requirements according to the zone district of the adjoining property or the classification of the adjacent road or river. (See attached road and river classification chart). 
2.  Buffers shall be located along the perimeter of a lot or parcel and shall extend to the boundary line of the lot or parcel. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing public or private street right-of-way. Where utility or drainage easements exist along property lines, the buffer shall be located adjacent to the easement and may be reduced by the width of the easement on the property where the buffer is required or twenty-five percent (25%) of the required buffer width, whichever is smaller. 
3.  Buffers which are required pursuant to this Article shall be indicated as such on all plats of new and expanded developments. 
4.  With the exception of the improvements as listed below in subsection 5., no new structures, impervious surfaces, unpaved vehicular use areas or other improvements shall hereafter be constructed within designated buffer areas. 
5.  Sidewalks pursuant to Section 54-361, fences, gates, mailboxes, community boat ramps, necessary driveways, and permitted signs may be installed in designated buffer areas, subject to applicable permits. 
b.  Non-conforming buffers. All developed lots and all undeveloped but recorded single-family house lots on (effective date) which do not comply with the buffer requirement of this section shall be grandfathered as legal non-conforming lots, except that existing landscaping on these legal non-conforming lots which satisfies, either partially or wholly, the buffer requirements of this Article, shall be required to be maintained. 
c.  Schedule of required buffers. Table 3.5 shows the required buffers. Compliance of planted buffers will be evaluated on the basis of "Required Plantings per one Hundred Feet" as specified on buffer diagram text. 
Existing vegetation may be combined with or substituted for new plant material in order to satisfy "Required Plantings per One Hundred Feet." 
Where deemed appropriate by the Zoning Administrator, non-vegetative screening devices, including fences, walls and earthen berms may be substituted for a portion of the "Required Plantings per one Hundred Feet" in buffer types B, D, F, J and K. 
d.  Exceptions. 
1.  All properties located within the City limits on the peninsula of Charleston shall not require installation of landscape buffers along street frontages; and landscape buffers required pursuant to Table 3.5: Schedule of Required Buffers, to separate and screen incompatible uses, shall only be required to consist of a landscaping area with a minimum width of five (5) feet in which a wall of at least six (6) feet in height is placed and one (1) recommended non-deciduous tree is planted for each twenty-five (25) feet linear feet of landscaping area. For the purposes of this Section, "peninsula" shall mean the area of the City of Charleston bounded by the Cooper River to the east, the Ashley River to the west and south, and the Charleston City Limits to the north. 
2.  Design Review District. In order to allow for new buildings to relate harmoniously with the streetscape and to other structures in the vicinity, when deemed appropriate by the Design Review Board, buildings may encroach into Class I Road Buffers (Buffer Type A), Class II Road Buffers (Buffer Type C), and Class VI Road Buffers (Buffer Type H). In Gathering Place Districts, the Design Review Board may allow buildings to encroach into any street frontage buffer, except for properties along I-26, I-526, the James Island Connector, and the Glenn McConnell Parkway. These exemptions shall not apply to parking lots or any other vehicular use areas. 
3.  Board of Architectural Review. In order to allow for new buildings to relate harmoniously with the streetscape and to other structures in the vicinity, when deemed appropriate by the Board of Architectural Review, buildings may encroach into Class I Road Buffers (Buffer Type A) and Class II Road Buffers (Buffer Type C). This exemption shall not apply to parking lots or any other vehicular use areas.

PART 3 - EXCEPTION TO VISION CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 54-510. - Exceptions to vision clearance requirements. 
In recognition of the historical character and intensity of land uses occurring within the city limits on the peninsula, south of a line running along Mount Pleasant Street extended from the Ashley River to Town Creek, the Department of Traffic and Transportation is authorized to grant a total or partial exemption to the vision clearance requirement of Section 54-351, upon a finding by the department that the proposed building encroachment will not create a traffic hazard. Applicants requesting an exemption shall submit to the Department of Traffic and Transportation surveys of the existing conditions at the street intersection(s), including sight distance requirements for the intersection(s) and further traffic studies as deemed necessary by the Department of Traffic and Transportation, and construction drawings showing the proposed encroachment(s).

PART 4 - EXCEPTIONS TO PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 54-511. - Exceptions to off-street parking requirements. 
a.  The number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter shall not be reduced except with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals upon a determination by the Board of Zoning Appeals that the enforcement of the required number of spaces would prevent reasonable use of a lot. In making the determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider each of the following: 
1.  Whether the proposed use is an allowed use in the applicable zoning district; 
2.  Whether the existing building(s) as configured on the lot, or the existing building(s) as configured on adjoining lots, make it feasible to provide off-street parking; 
3.  Whether street frontage of an existing lot is so limited that a driveway for access to a parking area would unreasonably or impracticably reduce the area available for occupancy by structures; 
4.  Whether grant of the special exception will adversely affect neighboring properties; 
5.  Whether the applicant has pursued good faith efforts to provide off-street parking. 
b.  The type of paving required for parking areas shall not be changed or eliminated except with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals, upon a determination by the Board of Zoning Appeals that the requirement for the paving type is unreasonable given the temporary nature of the parking area, the volume of traffic using the parking area, or the lack of adequate stormwater drainage in the area. In making a determination of what type of paving would be suitable, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the type of vehicles which will typically use the parking lot, the anticipated amount of daily or weekly traffic, the drainage conditions of the site and surrounding area, and the character of the property, historic or otherwise, and the surrounding neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 1999-54, § 4, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 54-512. - Exceptions to off-street loading requirements. 
No designated off-street loading space shall be encroached upon by another use nor shall the number of loading spaces be reduced except upon a finding of the Board of Zoning Appeals that the character of an existing lot and the character of intensely developed surrounding properties renders the strict application of the regulations impossible without denying a reasonable use of a particular lot. 
(Ord. No. 1999-54, § 4, 4-27-99) 
PART 5 - EXCEPTIONS TO BUFFER REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 54-513. - Exceptions to buffer requirements.

a.  There is a stormwater management plan which addresses, to the satisfaction of the Board based upon a review of the plan by the Technical Review Committee, the design, construction, future maintenance and future monitoring of storm water runoff resulting from the development of the Lot, which has been certified by an engineer licensed by the State of South Carolina. 
b.  The project's engineer certifies that the adverse impact on water quality in the adjacent water body of the project is equal to, or less than, what the impact would have been with compliance with the critical line buffer requirements. 
c.  The Board shall consider the project's stormwater management plan, the project engineer's certification and such other information as the Board shall elect, in its sole discretion. The Board shall have the right, but not the obligation, to have such information reviewed by an independent engineer and the project applicant shall bear the reasonable cost of such review.

The purpose of this article is to provide for the identification and reservation of land for the future location, expansion or improvement of streets, roads, highways or other public ways in order to promote and preserve the public safety, economy, order, appearance, convenience, prosperity and general welfare and is adopted pursuant to the authority of South Carolina Code Section 6-7-1210, et seq (1976), as amended. 
Sec. 54-702. - Establishment of official road plan maps. 
There is hereby established an official map to be known as the "Official Road Plan Map," which map, as may be hereafter supplemented, shall designate existing or proposed public streets or ways within the City that are targeted for creation, expansion or other improvements. The Official Road Plan Map shall initially consist of a series of eight (8) separate maps which are hereby adopted as the Official Road Plan Map and which shall be deemed a part of the Zoning Ordinance and filed in the office of the Department of Planning and Urban Development, with a duplicate copy being filed in the Department of Traffic and Transportation. 
The Official Road Plan Map may be modified or supplemented pursuant to the procedure for modifying or supplementing the Zoning Ordinance; provided however, that the Planning Commission shall report to City Council on proposed changes or modifications within thirty (30) days of its receipt of such proposed change or modification, and failing to do so, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval of such proposed change or modification. 
The adoption of the Official Road Plan Map shall not be deemed to constitute the opening, establishment, improvement or expansion of any street or other public way or the taking or accepting of any land for such purpose. 
(Ord. No. 1999-54, § 4, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 54-703. - Applicability of regulations. 
After the effective date hereof, no permit shall be issued for the construction, improvement, repair or moving of any building or structure and no change in land use shall be made on any land located within the lines of those streets or public ways designated on the Official Road Plan Map. 
After the effective date hereof, all subdivision plats and site plans which include properties that are shown on the Official Road Plan Map as proposed or improved streets or other public ways shall designate such on the subdivision plat or site plan. 
To the extent that an owner of property refrains from utilizing such part of his land that is located within the lines of the proposed streets or public ways designated on the Official Road Plan Map in order to accommodate the creation, expansion or other improvement to the street or public way that is not required as a result of the owner's proposed development or use of this property, then such owner shall nonetheless be entitled to utilize such land for purposes of signage, overflow parking and the applicable portion of landscaping requirements; provided however, that applicable setback provisions shall be measured from the boundary of the proposed created, expanded or improved street or public way. Nothing herein shall be construed, however, to relieve an owner of property from bearing all costs incident to a right-of-way dedication, including engineering and construction costs, when such dedications are required to serve the additional traffic as may be generated by the owner's development. Under no circumstances shall an owner of property be required to pay the expense of any creation or improvement to any street or public way which is not directly related to the owner's proposed use of his property. 
Sec. 54-704. - Appeal. 
In cases where any permit has been refused under the provisions of Section 54-703, the following appeal procedure may be utilized by any affected property owner: 
a.  An appeal, delineating such grounds as the applicant may deem worthy, shall be presented to the Planning Commission. 
b.  The Planning Commission shall evaluate the appeal and make a report, within thirty (30) days, to City Council and to any other appropriate public agency. If no report is made within thirty (30) days, the Planning Commission shall be deemed to have recommended that the appeal be granted. 
c.  The Planning Commission's report shall recommend: 
1.  That City Council take official action to exempt the affected land from the restrictions of the Official Road Plan Map; or 
2.  That City Council take official action to authorize the issuance of desired permits, subject to specified conditions accepted by the owner; or 
3.  That City Council initiate the appropriate action to acquire the property. 
d.  Upon receipt of the report of the Planning Commission, the City Council shall, within one hundred (100) days:

3.  Either enter into an agreement to acquire or institute condemnation proceedings to acquire the property affected. 
Action to acquire such property may be instituted by City Council or such other public agency, as may be appropriate. 
Failure of City Council to act within one hundred (100) days of the receipt of the report of the Planning Commission shall be deemed to constitute approval of the proposed appeal. Thereupon, a denied permit shall be issued upon demand. 
(Ord. No. 1999-54, § 4, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 54-705. - Exemption.

Sec. 54-808. - Subdivision procedures. 
1.  Generally. The City shall approve, pursuant to the procedures described herein, any subdivision of land as defined in section 54-803, except that the subdivision of land into parcels of five (5) acres or more where no new street is involved and where the resulting lots meet the requirements of this chapter shall not require the approval of the City but shall be reviewed by the Administrator for compliance with this chapter prior to being recorded. All subdivisions shall meet the requirements of this chapter before such subdivision or rights-of-way shall be platted, recorded, or have lots offered for sale. No plat of a subdivision, with the exception listed above, shall be filed or recorded in the Office of the Register Mesne Conveyance or Register of Deeds of the appropriate county until such plat shall have been approved by the Administrator and City Engineer, pursuant to the procedures described herein, and the approval entered in writing on the plat by the City Engineer. 
2.  Classification of subdivisions. All subdivisions shall be classified as either a major subdivision, or a minor subdivision. A concept plan shall not be required when the proposed plan of subdivision for the property is deemed to be a minor subdivision. 
a.  Major subdivision. Means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into five (5) or more lots, or includes all division of land involving any of the following: 
(1)  A new or extended public or private right-of-way, but not including future street alignments illustrated in a plan of resubdivision as required by section 54-814. 
(2)  Improvement(s) within an existing street right-of-way, other than repair of streets, or repair or construction of sidewalk(s) or other pedestrian connections required by these regulations, fire hydrants or other types of minor improvements necessary to serve the lots being created. 
(3)  A future public school site, park site, greenway corridor or open space site. 
(4)  The dedication of a right-of-way or easement for construction of a public water or sewer transmission line. 
(5)  Dedications, reservations, improvements, or environmental conditions that, in the opinion of the administrator with advice from reviewing agencies, require construction documents to be reviewed prior to final plat approval in order to insure the public health, safety, and welfare. 
b.  Minor subdivision. A division of land where the conditions for major subdivision review, as set out in section 54-808.2.a are not present. 
3.  Major subdivision review procedures. Before any major subdivision is recorded, the owner of the property proposed to be subdivided, or an authorized agent, shall, upon payment of applicable fees as determined by the City Council, apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedures: 
a.  Discussion at a required pre-application conference of the subdivision requirements and procedures for the proposed project, and possible issues related to the development of the property. 
b.  Submittal of the concept plan prepared in accordance with section 54-809 or the PUD site plan prepared in accordance with section 54-255.c for Planning Commission Review and approval and the securing of required approvals from other public agencies and any affected utility districts and companies. 
c.  Submittal of a development plan as described in section 54-810 to the Zoning Division for review and approval by the Technical Review Committee. 
d.  Submittal of the final subdivision plat, prepared in accordance with Section 54-811, to the Zoning Division for review and approval by the Plat Review Committee and City Engineer in preparation for recording with the Register of Mesne Conveyance or Register of Deeds. 
4.  Minor subdivision review procedures. Before any minor subdivision is recorded, the owner of the property proposed to be subdivided, or an authorized agent, shall, upon payment of applicable fees as determined by the City Council, apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedures: 
a.  Submittal of a preliminary plat that contains the information required in section 54-810, 1, a, (2), to the Zoning Division for review by the Plat Review Committee. 
b.  Submittal of the final subdivision plat, prepared in accordance with section 54-811, to the zoning division for review and approval by the Plat Review Committee and City Engineer in preparation for recording with the Register of Mesne Conveyance or register of deeds. 
5.  Coordination of rezoning application with subdivision application. It is the intent of these regulations that the review of a subdivision concept plan may be carried out simultaneously with the review of a rezoning application made under the Zoning Ordinance. In addition to the application required for the requested rezoning, an application for concept plan approval may be submitted for a coordinated review. 
a.  General requirement. Whenever a rezoning is requested and development would require the subdivision of a tract, vacant or improved, into two (2) or more lots or the consolidation of lots, the concept plan application may be considered simultaneously with the rezoning application. 
b.  Procedure to be followed: 
1.  Concept plan approval required. The application for concept plan approval shall be made pursuant to the requirements of section 54-809 and shall accompany the rezoning application on the forms required for a rezoning available from the Zoning Division. The Administrator shall then coordinate and send the concept plan and rezoning application submittals to the Planning Commission for concurrent review. Any approval of the concept plan by the Planning Commission shall be conditioned upon ratification of the rezoning application by the City Council. 
2.  Resubmission of concept plan if major revisions required. After completing its review of the rezoning application and the concept plan, and approving, approving with conditions, or disapproving the concept plan, the Planning Commission shall forward its recommendations on the rezoning application to the City Council for their final decision. If the City Council approved zoning requires major revisions to the concept plan as described in section 54-809.5.b, the applicant shall resubmit the concept plan for Planning Commission approval. A rezoning and approved concept plan for a subdivision entitle the developer to make application for development plan approval, and subsequently, for approval of a final subdivision plat approval. 
6.  Reserve parcels. Small parcels not conforming in size or shape with all regulations shall not be platted, except in the case of utility and drainage lots. All land within a tract proposed for subdivision shall be incorporated in lots, lands held in common, or rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 2007-35, § 1, 2-13-07; Ord. No. 2013-143, §§ 2, 3, 12-3-13; Ord. No. 2017-150, § 1, 12-11-17 ) 
Sec. 54-809. - Concept plan or PUD site plan. 
1.  Pre-application conference. Before preparing the concept plan or PUD site plan for a major subdivision, it is required that the applicant schedule a pre-application conference through the Zoning Division within the Department of Planning, Preservation and Sustainability. 
2.  Application procedure and requirements. A request to subdivide land shall be made by the owner of the land, or an authorized representative, by filing an application for approval of a concept plan or PUD site plan with the Planning Commission. 
a.  Application requirements. The application shall: 
(1)  Be made on forms available from the Zoning Division and shall be accompanied by a fee as determined by City Council. 
(2)  Be accompanied by the concept plan or PUD site plan and include all information described on the Concept Plan Submittal Checklist For Subdivision Applications available from the Zoning Division. 
(3)  For subdivisions where the total area to ultimately be developed permits fifty (50) or more single-family or two-family dwelling units, a full traffic impact study shall be required unless the Department of Traffic and Transportation deems that a traffic impact study is not required, on the basis of the Department's prior studies, analysis, and evaluation of transportation facilities; except that this requirement for a traffic impact study shall not apply to subdivisions of land zoned "PUD" where a traffic impact study was completed with the approved master plan. Similarly, and depending on the type and size of the subdivision, the Department of Traffic and Transportation may require a basic level of traffic impact study as opposed to a full traffic impact study. 
(4)  For each subdivision where the total area to ultimately be developed is ten (10) or more acres, a preliminary drainage study and plan shall be required; except that this requirement for a drainage study shall not apply to subdivisions of land zoned "PUD" where a drainage study was completed with the approved master plan. A full basin study may be required as part of the preliminary drainage study and plan in basins with known drainage problems, as determined by the Engineering Division. The drainage study and plan shall be of sufficient detail to assess the preliminary sizing and location of all major drainage facilities proposed and the associated easements. The plan shall locate all existing easements and intended outfalls. The study and plan shall support compliance with all current drainage policies of the City. 
b.  Complete applications forwarded. No application shall be accepted or forwarded to the Technical Review Committee until all requirements of section 54-809.2.a are satisfied. 
3.  Approval procedures. 
a.  Staff review and determination of subdivision category. The administrator shall initiate a review of the concept plan and any exhibits submitted in conformance with these regulations and shall determine whether the concept plan constitutes a major or minor subdivision as described under section 54-808.2. 
b.  Technical Review Committee. A review shall be performed by the Technical Review Committee. Representatives of the state, or boards or commissions may be included in the review as appropriate. The review shall be conducted in accordance with the published review schedule. The findings of the review process shall be presented to the Planning Commission.

In addition, the property to which such application applies shall be posted with a sign along each public thoroughfare that abuts the property at least six (6) days prior to any public hearing when the application will be considered. 
b.  Planning Commission Review and decision. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing and review the concept plan or PUD site plan, supplemental data, and the results of the administrative reviews, and advise the applicant of any required changes or additions. 
c.  Time limitations for the Planning Commission to act. The Planning Commission shall have not more than sixty (60) days from the date of the receipt of the concept plan or PUD site plan with all documentation required by this chapter to act. The sixty-day time limit may be extended by mutual agreement. Failure of the Planning Commission to act upon an application within the prescribed time shall be deemed approval of the concept plan or PUD site plan. In such event, a notice to proceed shall be issued by the Administrator, upon demand, and the applicant may proceed to apply for development plan approval in the manner prescribed by section 54-810. If no development plan is required, the applicant may proceed to final subdivision plat approval in the manner prescribed in section 54-811. The applicant is cautioned that such default approvals shall not exempt a subdivision from compliance with the Zoning Ordinance provisions. 
d.  Planning Commission action. After the Planning Commission approves, conditionally approves, or disapproves the concept plan or PUD site plan, a letter containing the resolution of the Planning Commission shall be sent to the developer or owner with the date of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval. If a concept plan is disapproved, the planning Commission shall state specific reasons for disapproval that shall be entered into the minutes of the meeting. 
e.  Sixty (60) days to submit revised plans. Any application that receives conditional approval from the Planning Commission shall be followed, within sixty (60) days from the date of the Planning Commission's decision, by submission of revised plans, or the commission's approval shall expire. This deadline may be extended by the Planning Commission. 
f.  Effective period of concept plan or PUD site plan approval. The approval of a concept plan or PUD site plan results in a vested right from the date of Planning Commission approval that lasts for two (2) years plus on going construction that proceeds in a timely manner. A lapse of six (6) months or more in construction after two (2) years from the date of approval will end this vested right term. Upon application by the landowner of property with a vested right at the end of the two (2) year vested right term to the Planning Commission, the term shall be extended on an annual basis for up to five (5) annual extensions, provided there have been no amendments to this chapter which precludes or prohibits any aspect of the approved plan. 
g.  Reapproval for expired concept plans or PUD site plans. Should concept plan or PUD site plan approval expire for any reason, any submittal for Planning Commission reapproval shall be subject to current Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations in effect at the time reapproval is sought. 
5.  Revisions to approved concept plans or PUD site plans. The applicant shall submit proposed revisions to the approved concept plan or PUD site plan to the Administrator. The Administrator shall initiate a review of the proposed revisions to be performed by the Technical Review Committee. For all revisions determined to be major revisions, Planning Commission approval shall be required. 
a.  Minor revisions. If the Administrator, with the advice of the Technical Review Committee, deems the revision(s) to be minor, the Administrator is authorized to approve the revisions to the concept plan. Minor revisions are insignificant shifts in street and open space locations, minor changes to lot size, minor changes to unit size and distribution of intensity not inconsistent with a final PUD or overlay approval and its associated concept plan, if applicable; minor shifts in lot lines; and other changes which do not alter the general layout and intensity of the approved concept plan, violate the requirements of this chapter, or have a significant impact on proposed or existing infrastructure. 
b.  Major revisions. All other revisions, including revisions that are determined by the administrator not to be minor revisions, shall be deemed to be major revisions. At the request of the applicant, any revised concept plan or PUD site plan shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for decision, including reversal of the decision of the Administrator. The Administrator may, at his or her discretion or on the advice of the Technical Review Committee direct any revised concept plan or PUD site plan to the Planning Commission. For all revisions determined to be major revisions, Planning Commission approval shall be required. The Planning Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the proposed major revision to the concept plan. Procedures for considering a major revision to a concept plan shall be the same as required for an initial application for concept plan or PUD site plan approval. 
c.  Failure of the Planning Commission to act. Failure of the Planning Commission to act in the prescribed time shall be deemed approval. The procedures contained in section 54-809.4.c shall be followed.

b.  Complete applications forwarded. No application shall be forwarded to the Technical Review Committee until all requirements of Section 54-810.1.a are satisfied. 
2.  Staff review. The Administrator shall initiate an administrative review of the development plan by the Technical Review Committee. Representatives of the state, or boards or commissions may be included in the review as appropriate. The review shall be conducted in accordance with the published review schedule. The purpose of the review shall be to verify that the required information has been submitted, all applicable regulations and standards have been met, and it complies with the approved concept plan or PUD site plan. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and construction feasibility of the development plan. 
3.  Decision on development plan. Upon completion of a review (see section 54-810.2), the applicable approval procedure below shall be followed. 
a.  Minor revisions. If the Administrator, with the advice of the Technical Review Committee, deems that the development plan shows no revisions or minor revisions to the approved concept plan or PUD site plan as described in section 54-809.5.a, and meets all the regulatory requirements, the Administrator is authorized to approve the development plan on behalf of the Planning Commission. The Administrator may direct a development plan to the Planning Commission according to the procedures of section 54-810.3.b. At the request of the applicant, a development plan shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for decision, including reversal of the decision of the Administrator. 
b.  Major revisions. All other revisions, shall be deemed to be major revisions as described in section 54-809.5.b.

The procedures contained in section 54-809.5.b for major revisions to the approved concept plan or PUD site plan shall be followed for any major revisions to the development plan. 
c.  Failure of the Administrator to act. Failure of the Administrator to act upon a development plan submitted under section 54-810.3 within sixty (60) days after receipt of the development plan with all required information shall be deemed approval of the plan, and in such event, a certificate of approval entitling the applicant to proceed shall be issued, upon demand, by the Administrator. Caution should be exercised in that such default approval shall not exempt the subdivision from compliance with the Zoning Ordinance provisions. 
4.  Appeal of staff decisions to Planning Commission. Staff decisions may be appealed to the Planning Commission by any party in interest if an appeal is filed with the Zoning Division within ten (10) business days after actual notice of the decision. The Planning Commission shall act on the appeal within sixty (60) days from receipt of the appeal and the action of the Planning Commission is final. 
5.  Effective period of development plan approval. The approval of a development plan results in a two-year vested right from the date of approval. Upon application by the landowner of property with a vested right at the end of the two-year vested right term to the Administrator, the term shall be extended on an annual basis for up to five (5) annual extensions, provided there have been no amendments to this chapter which precludes or prohibits any aspect of the approved development plan. 
6.  New information. When new information related to the natural characteristics of the land is discovered during construction, the project engineer shall promptly advise the appropriate City agency of details of the found conditions, the impacts, and the modifications to the infrastructure which are to be made. Such found conditions may include, but are not limited to, the presence of archaeologically, culturally, or environmentally sensitive or geologic hazard areas. If the modifications to the development plan are determined to be major, as described in section 54-810.3.b and the development plan no longer complies with the concept plan or PUD site plan, Planning Commission approval shall be required for a revision to the concept plan or PUD site plan to comply with the revised development plan based on the new information. 
(Ord. No. 2007-35, § 1, 2-13-07; Ord. No. 2013-143, § 2, 12-3-13)

(Ord. No. 2007-35, § 1, 2-13-07) 
Sec. 54-813. - Phasing major subdivision plats. 
Phasing major subdivision plats. The Administrator may permit a subdivision that has been given concept plan approval to be divided into two (2) or more phases for development plan and final platting purposes and may impose such conditions upon the filing of each phase, as it may deem necessary, to assure the orderly development of the subdivision. Each phase shall be bonded independently of the other phases, unless expressly stated otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 2007-35, § 1, 2-13-07) 
Sec. 54-814. - Resubdivision of land. 
Procedure for subdivision where future resubdivision is foreseen. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided, and the subdivision plat shows one (1) or more lots containing more than one (1) acre of land or double the minimum required area for the zoning district in which the lot is located, and the Administrator has reason to believe that such lots shall be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the Administrator shall require that the subdivision and development of such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets by restricting building locations. A plan of resubdivision shall be depicted on a concept plan drawing unless the applicant can demonstrate that the need for such future street connection is unnecessary. The Administrator shall require that future dedications providing for the opening and extension of such streets be so indicated on the plat. 
(Ord. No. 2007-35, § 1, 2-13-07) 
Sec. 54-815. - Miscellaneous platting situations. 
Converting parcels to building sites. A land parcel created by deed or land parcel identified as a reserve parcel on a plat may be converted to a building site within the limits set forth in this chapter. Removal of the reserve status shall require Planning Commission approval.

Secs. 54-817-54-819. - Reserved. 
PART 3 - SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 54-820. - Design standards for terrain. 
a.  No platting of land for residential use or purpose shall occur in areas subject to periodic flooding by normal tides, swamps, marshes, or other undrained areas, unless suitable provision is made for satisfactory drainage. 
b.  Drainage improvements shall be required pursuant to approved drainage studies and plans, and the drainage policies of the City of Charleston. 
(Ord. No. 2003-70, § 5, 8-19-03) 
Sec. 54-821. - Street design standards. 
a.  The layout of streets as to arrangement, character, width, grade, and location may be required to conform to the general plan of the entire tract where completed, to adjoining street systems of adjoining properties, to the major thoroughfare plans of the city, and to the topography, natural features, and drainage systems to be provided. 
b.  Local streets shall be designed as an interconnected street system while incorporating lower speed geometries. 
c.  Subdivisions which abut or have included within the proposed area to be subdivided any limited access, major thoroughfare, or arterial streets shall provide: 
1.  A marginal access street, or 
2.  Reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, or 
3.  Lots with rear service drives, or 
4.  Other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
The city engineer shall specify which of the above requirements apply to each individual case based upon adequate service to the public interest. 
d.  Reserve strips or parcels controlling access to streets shall be prohibited, except where justification is shown by the developer. 
e.  Street jogs, with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided. 
f.  A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet shall be introduced between reverse curves on major traffic streets. 
g.  When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than one hundred (100) feet for minor and collector streets, and of such greater radii as the city engineer shall determine for special cases. 
h.  Streets shall be so laid out as to avoid acute angles as nearly as practicable between streets at their intersections, except in the case of merging streets. 
i.  Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of not less than fifteen (15) feet. Larger radii may be required by the city engineer when, in his opinion, such design is advisable to permit the construction of curbs of large radius. 
j.  Streets shall be defined according to the following functional classifications and right-of-way widths, pavement widths and curb radii shall be as follows: 
1.  Definitions of Functional Classifications of Streets 
(a)  Access Street: Sometimes called a place or lane, the access street is designed to conduct traffic between dwelling units and higher-order streets. As the lowest-order street in the hierarchy, the access street carries some through traffic and includes short streets, cul-de-sacs and courts. 
(b)  Subcollector Street: The subcollector provides passage to access streets and conveys traffic to collectors. Like the access street, the subcollector provides frontage and access to residential lots but also carries some through traffic to lower-order (access) streets. The subcollector is a relatively low-volume street. 
(c)  Collector Street: A street which collects internal traffic movements within an area of the city, such as among subdivisions, and connects this area with the arterial street system. It does not handle long through trips, but performs the same land service function as a local street. 
(d)  Arterial Street: A facility designed mainly for through traffic, but it also normally performs a secondary land service function. Parking and loading may be restricted or prohibited to improve the capacity for moving traffic. It accommodates major movements of traffic not served by expressways and brings traffic to and from expressways. 
2.  Minimum right-of-way widths and pavements widths (exclusive of curb and gutter). See Table 8.1. 
3.  Minimum radii. See Table 8.2. 
k.  Half streets along property lines shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and where the city engineer finds that it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half street exists adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
l.  Dead-end streets designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than eight hundred (800) feet except where land cannot be subdivided otherwise practicably and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having a street property line diameter of at least eighty (80) feet. 
m.  No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street names proposed by the subdivider shall be subject to check by the GIS Division and where duplication or confusion with names of existing streets occurs, the GIS Division shall require the subdivider to substitute names free from duplication or confusion.

n.  Streets and intersection approaches shall not be excessive in grade nor be less than three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) in the gutter profile. Variation from these grades may, however, be permitted by the city engineer where advisable, to adjust to topographical conditions. 
o.  Alleys shall be permitted where required to provide for service access, such as off-street parking, loading, and unloading, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Such alleys shall have a minimum right-of-way of twenty (20) feet with a minimum pavement width of twelve (12) feet. 
p.  All streets shall be paved in accordance with minimum requirements on file in the office of the city engineer. Final approval, however, may be granted prior to paving, provided adequate bond or escrow of funds conditioned on said paving being completed within one year of the final approval is filed with the city treasurer. 
q.  Roads of an existing subdivision shall not be used as the sole means of ingress and egress in developing a new subdivision or extending an existing one, when other access can be made available and when in the opinion of the city engineer such use would create a safety hazard or otherwise be detrimental to the residents of the existing subdivision due to increased traffic and noise. 
r.  No street shall be located within a critical area or freshwater or saltwater wetland unless the applicant shall supply to the City the written approval of OCRM or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or both, as appropriate. 
s.  Street connectivity requirements: An interconnected street system is necessary in order to provide for access between developments without returning to major roadways, in order to provide access for emergency and service vehicles, in order to enhance and encourage non-vehicular travel, in order to plan for future development and transportation needs and in order to create neighborhoods. 
The following street connectivity requirements shall apply: 
1.  All subdivisions and developments shall include improved street connections to other streets within the development and to adjoining streets, neighborhoods, existing developments, developed tracts and undeveloped tracts. However, subdivisions and developments which are physically isolated by water, marsh, or wetlands from other streets, subdivisions, neighborhoods, existing developments or undeveloped tracts, shall not be required to include street connections. 
2.  Street connections to adjoining undeveloped tracts shall include a temporary turnaround, in the form of easements or right-of-way, until such time that the adjoining tract is developed and the temporary turnaround area can be abandoned. 
3.  The appropriateness, location and application of such required street connections are subject to the review and approval of the Zoning Administrator. Street connections shall be made according to appropriate land planning practices for the type of development proposed and the characteristics of adjoining properties. 
t.  Within the Neighborhood District, subsections b, c, e, f, g, j, k, l, and s of this section shall not apply. Streets in the Neighborhood Districts shall connect to other streets within the neighborhood and to adjoining streets, neighborhoods, existing developments and undeveloped tracts. Cul-de-sacs, T-turnarounds, and gated or dead-end streets are not permitted, unless unavoidable due to physical constraints of the site or an adjoining site. 
In the event of unavoidable physical constraints, a modified cul-de-sac may be used if it does not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length and meets one of the following criteria: 
1.  It incorporates a design feature at the center of the turn-around such as a natural area with existing trees, a landscaped space, or an outdoor space with amenities that is a size at least equal to the square footage of the pavement within the turn-around area. 
2.  It provides a pedestrian access area to the marsh front, waterfront, or other physical feature that necessitates the cul-de-sac that is of a size at least equal to the square footage of the turn-around. 
Gated streets are not permitted. 
u.  Within the Neighborhood District, each building must front a neighborhood district street type or outdoor space as defined in Section 54-295, excluding conservation areas. Streets shall be classified according to the following hierarchy and follow the design and tree planting requirements of Table 8-2.1: 
Type 1 
ND Mixed-Use Street This is a street with low to moderate vehicular speed [20 to 25 mph] and high vehicular and pedestrian traffic volumes. Pedestrian-oriented amenities, as sidewalks or walking paths, are required on these streets to accommodate safety, convenience and enjoyable walking. Type 1 streets are located within neighborhood mixed-use centers and in higher density areas. Type 2 
ND5 
Residential 
Street This is a street with low to moderate vehicular speed [20 to 25 mph] and a significant volume of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian-oriented amenities, as sidewalks or walking paths, are required on these streets to accommodate safety, convenience and enjoyable walking. Type 3 
ND One Way 
Street This is a street with low to moderate vehicular speed [20 to 25 mph] and that only carries vehicle traffic one-way. Pedestrian-oriented amenities, as sidewalks or walking paths, are required on these streets to accommodate safety, convenience and enjoyable walking. Type 4 
ND Road This is a street that does not include curb/gutter. Sidewalks are not required as this street is intended for use where off-street paths exist or the streets themselves are used for pedestrian travel. Type 4 streets must incorporate swales to accommodate stormwater drainage. Type 4 streets will only be allowed in areas of greater environmental or rural sensitivity and may not constitute more than forty (40) percent of the total linear feet of roadways in the neighborhood. Type 5 
ND Alley This street is defined as an alley and provides rear access to building lots for service accessparking access, and utility easements. This street is defined as an alley and carries vehicular traffic one-way. Type 6 
ND Avenue This street type is defined as an Avenue and is designed to accommodate primarily vehicular traffic. The Type 6 Avenue can function as connectors between Neighborhood Districts and other developments.  
v.  In addition to the right-of-way standards in Table 8.1, the following street types are also permitted per Table 8.2.2:

Sec. 54-822. - Design standards for easements. 
a.  Easements for utilities along rear and side property lines may be required by the city engineer where necessary. In particular cases, easements across lots may be required by the city engineer to meet extreme conditions. 
b.  Easements, when provided, shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet in width and shall center along a common property line where appropriate. 
c.  Easements, when required for drainage or sewage for the area to be subdivided, shall be of such width as necessary to permit proper construction of drainage facilities based on the drainage system of the area. No subdivision shall block or obstruct the natural drainage of an adjoining area. Existing natural drainage shall be maintained or replaced where possible or feasible. 
Sec. 54-823. - Design standards for blocks. 
a.  The lengths, widths and shapes, of blocks shall be determined with regard to: 
1.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use (residential, commercial, industrial, other) contemplated. 
2.  Area and spacing requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions. 
3.  Needs for convenient access, circulations, control and safety of street traffic. 
4.  Limitations and opportunities of topography and drainage features. 
b.  No side of a proposed block shall exceed eight hundred (800) feet unless a minimum twenty-foot wide through-block alley or pedestrian accessway is provided, and no side of any block which incorporates pedestrian accessways or alleys shall exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet in length, except that, in a Neighborhood District, no side of a proposed block shall exceed six hundred (600) feet in length without another street providing through access to another street. This length may be extended to eight hundred (800) feet provided a through-block pedestrian accessway is provided. Through-block pedestrian accessways shall be a minimum fifteen (15) wide with a minimum ten-foot wide surfaced path and shall be located in the center of the block or in the most practical location to facilitate pedestrian circulation within the neighborhood or to provide access to special neighborhood features.

1.  to hear and decide appeals to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance cited below when it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the administrative officer in the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Charleston: 
(a)  provisions of Article 3: Part 4: Off-Street Parking Requirements, relating to parking space design and maneuverability standards;

c.  Notwithstanding the provisions above in subsection a.3., in cases where a project may require appeals from the zoning administrator and/or variances from both the Board of Zoning Appeals-Zoning and Board of Zoning Appeals-Site Design, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to direct all variance requests to the Board of Zoning Appeals-Zoning, where, by reason of the complexity of the project, the interrelationship of the variances, or the minor nature of the site-design request, it would be appropriate for one board to consider all variance requests. 
d.  All final decisions and orders of the Board shall be in writing and be permanently filed in the office of the Board as a public record. All findings of fact and conclusions of law must be separately stated in final decisions or orders of the Board which must be delivered to parties of interest by certified mail. 
(Ord. No. 1999-54, § 3A, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 54-924. - Requirements for granting a variance. 
A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board makes and explains in writing the following findings: 
a.  there are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property; 
b.  these conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity; 
c.  because of these conditions, the application of the ordinance to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; and 
d.  the authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance. 
However, an affirmative vote of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the Board members present and voting shall be required before a variance may be granted for a use of land, a building or a structure that is prohibited in a given district ("Use Variance") by ordinance or resolution; provided, however, that City Council may overrule the decision of the Board pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-800 and such other laws as may apply. For a Use Variance that has been granted by the Board, no vested right shall attach thereto and no permit shall be issued for 15 days from the date of the granting of a Use Variance by the Board to determine whether City Council intends to consider overruling such Use Variance. If the Mayor or any member of City Council delivers notice to the Zoning Administrator of intent to consider overruling a Use Variance within 15 days of the granting of a Use Variance by the Board, then the Board's decision shall be held in abeyance, no vested right shall attach to the Use Variance granted by the Board and no permit shall be issued until City Council has determined whether to overrule the Board's granting of the Use Variance. No person with a substantial interest in the Use Variance granted by the Board shall have a right to appeal such decision to City Council and may only appeal such decision to Circuit Court for errors of law pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-820 and § 54-930 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Charleston and such other provisions as may apply. Because S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-820 and § 54-930 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Charleston establish the time limit for appeals of decisions of the Board, any person with a substantial interest in the granting of a Use Variance by the Board shall file an appeal with the Circuit court within 30 days after the decision of the Board is mailed and shall deliver a copy of such appeal to the City. If an appeal is filed and a timely notice of intent to consider overruling a Use Variance granted by the Board is delivered to the Zoning Administrator by the Mayor or a member of City Council in accordance with this section, such appeal shall not divest City Council of its right to consider overruling the granting of a Use Variance by the Board and City Council may proceed to hear the matter of whether to overrule the Use Variance pending appeal to Circuit Court. City Council shall consider the matter of overruling the granting of a use variance at its next regularly scheduled meeting after the decision of the Board is mailed or as soon thereafter as may be practicable. City Council may defer or continue its deliberations on the matter, but shall make a final decision on the appeal within three (3) regularly scheduled City Council meetings after it is first considered. In the event City Council does not consider the matter at is regularly scheduled meeting after the decision of the Board is mailed, City Council shall be divested of is right to consider overruling the granting of such Use Variance by the Board.

PART 6 - TEMPORARY MORATORIUM - CHURCH CREEK DRAINAGE BASIN[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-060, § 1, adopted May 30, 2017, repealed former Part 6, §§ 54-970-59-974, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Part 6 pertained to a temporary moratorium on "late night bar" permits in the commercial corridors of King, East Bay and Market Streets and derived from Ord. No. 2014-136, § 1, adopted Oct. 14, 2014. 

Sec. 59-970. - Temporary Moratorium. 
Findings: City Council finds that an area of the City, hereafter defined as the Church Creek Drainage Basin, is comprised of nearly 5,000 acres that have very limited points of discharge for stormwater and a broad defined floodplain. Because of the topography, high tides and significant rain events, homes and other developed properties in the Basin have experienced severe and more frequent flooding during rainstorms. Continued development within certain portion of Basin could further exacerbate and impact the potential for flooding and property damage and compromise public safety. Notwithstanding ongoing efforts by the City to study and model the drainage conditions in the Basin and to update and implement regulations to alleviate flooding conditions there, it is evident that, absent a thorough evaluation of the drainage patterns in portions of the Basin, of the development and infrastructure in place, and of development that will reasonably occur in these areas in the immediate future, development in the Basin, both existing and planned, will be threatened, as well as the quality of life of those who live and work there now and those who will in the future. The public health and safety and the economic well-being of the City and of its residents who live, work and shop in the affected area demand that measures be taken to temporarily limit further development in the portions of the Basin located in the 100-year floodplain for a reasonable period of time to enable the City to update the drainage study of these portions of the Basin and implement the recommendations thereof. 
A.  Moratorium. 
(1)  Subject to the exceptions as set forth in subsection B hereof, no application for a permit from the Departments of Planning, Preservation and Sustainability and Public Service for new construction (except for a building permit for a single family dwelling on an existing lot of record as of the date of ratification of the ordinance from which this part derives) shall be processed or granted during the duration set forth in subsection E hereof, for any property located in the 100-year floodplain within the boundaries of the Church Creek Drainage Basin, as the same is set forth on a GIS map dated ________________ entitled Church Creek Area Drainage Basin 100-year floodplain, attached hereto and made a part hereof a duplicate original of which is on file in the Department of Planning, Preservation and Sustainability. 
B.  Exceptions: Excepted from the provisions of subsection A (1) are: 
(1)  Projects subject to Technical Review Committee (herein TRC) review that, as of February 28, 20017, had TRC approval. 
(2)  Projects not subject to TRC review that, as of February 28, 2017, had building permit approval. 
(3)  Construction on a lot of record not subject to TRC review and where, as of February 28, 2017, the system for managing the stormwater from the lot has received final approval from the city. 
(4)  Applications to adjust lot lines, or to subdivide acreage, except for final residential development plats. 
(5)  Notwithstanding the above, an applicant may proceed at his own risk with securing and acting on development permits and approvals, except for permits to pave or construct buildings, during the duration set forth in Section E; provided however, all such applicants and any permits acquired during this time shall be subject to applicable stormwater regulations the City develops from the information received by the study of the drainage basin commissioned by the City. 
C.  Alteration of District Boundary: Nothing herein shall be construed to limit or abridge the right of an applicant to seek a review and potential alteration of a property being located within the 100-year floodpalin of the Church Creek Drainage Basin upon a showing of topographic data that supports the alteration. Any such alterations shall require the approval of City Council, after recommendation of the Director of the Department of Public Service. 
D.  Status Reports: For the duration set forth in Section E, the Director of Public Service, or her designee, shall provide monthly status reports to City Council and other interested parties on the progress of the study and such recommendations as may be available from the City's consultant, regarding stormwater management in the Church Creek Drainage Basin. 
E.  Duration: The provisions of this Part 5 of Article 9 of the Zoning Ordinance shall expire nine (9) months from February 28, 2017.

1.  An impact analysis must be submitted that indicates the potential number of members, the characteristics of the golf course membership, a traffic impact analysis and a complete site analysis as detailed below: 
(a)  Required Site Analysis. The layout of any golf course shall be determined after preparing the required site analysis. The detailed site analysis will be done in order to identify the site's most significant environmental, historic, cultural, and natural resources. The site analysis will include: 
i.  Vegetation. Characteristics of a vegetation survey related to land use will describe principal, predominant, and significant vegetation, by type, condition, age, use, and general or specific location. Features in the survey will include trees and shrubs, agricultural fields, tree lines, native vegetation, orchards, groves, woodlots, pastures, wetlands, forests, and grasslands. The vegetation survey shall indicate any significantly large trees or endangered plant or animal species that may reside on the site and is protected by law. 
ii.  Historical, Archaeological and Cultural Resources. Historical resources located within the proposed golf course development must be identified on the plat. Sources such as the County of Charleston Historical Survey (1991), state registers, and federal registers such as the National Register of Historic Places shall be utilized in identifying these resources. The historical survey is important for noting structures and areas that must be protected as designated landmarks. 
iii.  Adjacent Land Use Patterns. Land use on adjacent properties shall be identified. Features such as, but not limited to, roads, rice dams, traditional settlement areas, cemeteries, clusters of structures, parks, marinas, and logging areas shall be shown. 
iv.  Hydrography. All water features including streams and sensitive areas on the site, such as wetlands and riparian corridors, must be located. The purpose of locating these features is to limit disturbance of soil and vegetation that affect water quality features. Hydrography shall be used to determine where water required wetland buffers and other requirements such as drainage easements will be located. Wetland buffers of 50 feet are required on all saltwater marshes, and 35 feet on all protected freshwater wetlands. All water bodies-rivers, streams, drainage channels, marshes or wetland, floodplains and aquifers must be inventoried or identified. 
v.  Wildlife Habitat Areas. The purpose of identifying wildlife areas is to assess the ecological conditions of the landscape and to provide continuation of these habitat areas. Features of this survey shall include the presence of any threatened or endangered species, natural areas vital to wildlife species, habitat areas that are connected to larger undisturbed natural habitat (connected habitat system). Through this method the study will develop key points or areas that should be left undeveloped, then define those areas most suitable for development. 
2.  Potential sites should be selected which allow the golf course to be routed in such a way as to minimize the need to alter, create or remove existing native landscapes, trees, and vegetation, and which provide opportunities for restoration/enhancement of valuable habitat. 
3.  Sites which have archaeologically or geologically significant and sensitive or critical habitat or environmental features shall be identified and either relocated or preserved through careful golf course design. Permanent open space easements or other techniques may be used, as appropriate, to effect preservation. The site design shall identify areas for restoration, replanting, and enhancement of riparian and littoral habitat to re-establish wildlife migration corridors and lineages between fragmented habitat areas. Protection and planned restoration/enhancements for such areas during construction and ongoing operation must be ensured. Native habitats and communities of special value to threatened/endangered species shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible, consistent with State and Federal regulation. 
4.  Each site selected [as a] golf course development will likely have a variety of habitat types present. These habitat types must be identified and provisions made for routing of the course or relocation of the species. 
5.  The site plan should protect drainage systems that support retained vegetation. Ponds shall be developed which mimic conditions in terms of both aesthetics and habitat. 
6.  Structures and buildings should be located such that impacts to habitats and significant natural areas are avoided. 
7.  Design and Construction Standards: 
(a)  Marshes, Creeks and Wetlands: 
i.  The golf course design must attempt to minimize the number of marsh, creek or wetland crossings. Marsh, creek or wetland crossings must be designed in such a way to minimize erosion and harmful effects of significant habitat and migration corridors. 
ii.  Bridges must minimize alteration of the marsh, creek or wetland environment. 
iii.  Design must create and restore riparian habitat, especially in previously degraded habitat areas, and must reduce the impact of alterations necessitated by design and construction of the course. 
iv.  The course design must employ vegetated buffer strips of sufficient width to mitigate impacts to riparian corridors and other significant habitat which may result from surface drainage of the golf course, cart paths, and other developed areas. In certain circumstances where riparian vegetation has been degraded or does not exist, turf grass and rough areas may be located in closer proximity to the marshes, creeks and wetlands. 
v.  Cart paths must be graded such that runoff from them generally does not flow directly into any marsh, creek or wetland. 
vi.  Construction fencing/siltation barriers must be utilized during the construction phase where needed to protect habitat and marsh, creek or wetland areas. 
(b)  Trees: 
i.  The selected site must not be heavily forested (with more than 60 percent tree canopy coverage). 
ii.  The design of the course and related facilities must maximize the preservation of clusters or significant stands of trees, particularly grand trees, and otherwise preserve "interior" habitat areas. 
iii.  Irrigation systems shall be designated to avoid impacting existing oaks or other sensitive vegetation. 
iv.  If required by the Planning Director, a certified professional arborist, botanist, or forester shall be employed by the applicant to evaluate the status of the trees and related habitats on the site and provide direction for restoration and/or enhancement of impacted trees. 
v.  Cart paths within the drip lines of trees slated for preservation must be grated in such a way as to not damage or stress the tree. 
vi.  Barriers (curbs, fencing, vegetation, etc.) should be established to discourage cart and pedestrian travel off paths located within or adjacent to sensitive habitat. 
(c)  Water Quality: 
i.  Lined artificial storage ponds must not be located in prime groundwater recharge areas. 
ii.  Turf grass species and landscaping around buildings should be selected which are drought resistant or tolerant and which are suited for any special site characteristics or soil conditions. 
iii.  State-of-the-art irrigation systems with site meteorological monitoring capability should be used to minimize water use. 
iv.  If on-site wells or ponds are to be used as the irrigation water source, analysis will be required to determine the safe yield in order to prevent aquifer, off-site wells and/or marsh, creek or wetland depletion. The developer will be held responsible for any negative impact on water supplies to adjacent or nearby properties. 
v.  Paved areas should be limited in order to minimize impermeable surfaces, and thereby reduce surface runoff. 
vi.  The project should employ established best management practices pursuant to the Non-Point Source Program guidelines to control non-point source (storm water) runoff pollution. For example: impervious liners for detention/retention ponds and water hazards to protect ground and surface water quality; buffer strips, oil/grease separators or other recommended techniques for parking area drainage systems; grease traps and other recommended technologies for facilities such as golf cart maintenance or wash areas to prevent untreated runoff from entering the natural aquatic environmental berms, vegetative strips, grease traps, or other recommended technologies in parking areas for drainage controls to minimize pollution to nearby riparian areas ad surface waters. 
vii.  The overall drainage system shall be designed to comply with all City codes and standards for storm water drainage systems. 
(d)  Archaeology: 
i.  The design of the course must preserve significant archaeological areas and/or historical features present on the site. 
ii.  Significant archaeological sites must be staked, flagged, or fenced off to insure their protection. 
(e)  Noise: 
i.  Where possible, clubhouse facilities and other noise-generating uses and facilities should be located away from neighbors who might be impacted. 
ii.  Roads must be sited such that traffic noise is minimized for adjacent areas. 
(f)  Growth-Inducing Impacts: 
i.  The project should not provide infrastructure improvements that would be capable of serving new development other than the proposed project. 
ii.  The project should not stimulate economic expansion or growth (e.g. major changes in tax revenue base, employment expansion, etc.) other than that necessary to serve the proposed project. 
iii.  In cases where the golf course developer owns lands adjacent to the project site, a plan for the potential development of those adjacent lands should be submitted for evaluation. 
iv.  Deed restrictions, open space easements, or other appropriate techniques must be used to mitigate or prevent growth-inducing impacts inside the development. 
8.  Time Limit for Staff Review. Upon the receipt of a complete application for a golf course, the Technical Review Committee shall have a maximum of 45 days to review the application. TRC's failure to review the application within 45 days will result in the applicant being granted a TRC approval. 
n.  Private Boat Ramp. All proposed private boat ramps shall comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of State and Federal agencies including but not limited to South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

APPENDIX I - STREET NAMING POLICY City of Charleston July 1995 
All streets to be platted within the city of Charleston must be named in accordance with the following policies. These policies address four issues: 
1.  Choosing a proper street name. 
2.  Choosing a proper street suffix (boulevard, avenue, court, etc.). 
3.  Properly applying street names to a proposed street layout. 
4.  Changing an existing street name. 
All preliminary plats must indicate proposed street names for all streets shown on the preliminary plat. The GIS Division shall have the final approval for all street names and suffixes. 
1.  Choosing a proper street name. 
Proposed street names will be checked with the most current list of existing street names in Charleston County and Berkeley County. Proposed street names which duplicate or might be confused with existing street names in either County will be rejected. 
2.  Choosing a proper street suffix. 
Street suffixes should be chosen based on the width and design of the proposed street. Within neighborhoods, street suffixes should be used to reinforce the neighborhood's street hierarchy. The GIS Division is responsible for approving proposed street suffixes. 
The following is a list of acceptable street suffixes. Suffixes other than those listed may be used with the approval of the GIS Division . 
Alley Avenue Bend Bluff Boulevard Circle Court Crescent Crossing Drive Expressway Highway Landing Lane Loop Parkway Pass Path Pike Place Point Road Row Run Spur Street Terrace Trace Trail View Walk Way  
3.  Properly applying street names to a proposed street layout. 
Street names must be applied to a proposed street layout in accordance with the following procedures. The GIS Division is responsible for approving the application of proposed street names. 
a.  Street names shall not change within a street. Extensions of existing streets should use the same name as the existing street. Streets should not change names except in the following circumstances: (offsets and 90 degree turns) 
b.  Thumbnail cul-de-sacs with a depth of more than 50 feet and four or more lots fronting on the cul-de-sac may require a separate street name if the GIS Division determines that the configuration of the lots and street would prevent the thumbnail cul-de-sac lots from being visible from the through street. 
c.  Existing patterns of applying street names within the area surrounding the proposed subdivision should be considered. 
d.  The application of street names should be as simple and sensible as possible. Unnecessary changes in street names create more confusion. 
4.  Changing an existing street name. 
The changing of an existing street name requires approval by the Planning Commission. 
Choosing a Proper Street Suffix 
** Intended to be used only for dead-end or cul-de-sac streets.

(Ord. No. 2002-121, § 1, 10-22-02; Ord. No. 2015-105, § 2, 8-18-2015) 
APPENDIX J - Cainhoy District Development Guidelines[1] 
A.  The intent of the Cainhoy Zoning District is to provide for appropriate sites for the establishment of a broad range of residential, commercial and industrial uses within the Cainhoy Peninsular portion of the City. In any Cainhoy CY Zoning District, land may be used and buildings or structures may be erected, altered or used for any purpose except the following prohibited uses: 
(1)  Mobile home parks or the use of a mobile home as a form of housing. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the use of a mobile home within the Cainhoy Zoning District for temporary commercial purposes, including temporary construction offices, temporary sales offices or other temporary commercial uses. 
(2)  Adult book stores, adult drive-in motion picture theaters, adult mini-motion picture theaters, adult motion picture theaters, adult show bars, bath houses or massage parlors. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to apply to the exhibition, presentation, showing or performance of any play, ballet, drama, tableau or production in any theater, concert hall, auditorium, museum of fine arts, school, institution of higher learning or other similar establishment which is primarily devoted to such exhibitions, presentations, shows or performances as a form of expression or opinion, communication, speech, ideas, information, art or drama. 
(3)  Stockyards. 
(4)  Junkyards. 
(5)  Storage yards which are primarily for outdoor storage equipment (excluding storage yards which are accessory uses and storage yards for vehicles and boats). The Board of Zoning Appeals, however, after review, shall permit such yards as an exception when it finds that adequate provision and maintenance of visual screening by fence, planting or other means from a public street or road or an adjacent residential zoning district will be provided. 
(6)  Landfills, sanitary landfills or any similar use involving the burial of trash, garbage or hazardous wastes between layers of dirt. 
B.  Parcels of property within the Cainhoy Zoning District shall be developed in accordance with approved "Development Plans," as hereinafter defined. A "Development Plan" is a general development plan which sites the roads, proposed use areas, buffers and the relationship of proposed uses to adjacent properties and which includes acreage of not less than 150 acres. Each Development Plan shall be presented at two public hearings, one before Planning Commission and one before City Council. The scope of review at such public hearings shall be limited to comment and review of the relationship of the proposed uses to roads, buffers and adjacent properties. The public bodies shall not have the right to restrict the use or density of the property as a result of such review of a proposed Development Plan. The approved Development Plan shall fix the uses and densities for the property contained within the Development Plan after its approval and the issuance of the first certificates of occupancy. 
Any subsequent change in use or densities after the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for a specific Development Plan shall require the approval of City Council upon a recommendation of the Planning Commission. Prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy, a Development Plan may be abandoned by written notice to the zoning administrator without penalty or consequence to the owner of the property. Likewise, minor modifications to the Development Plan may be made upon written approval of City Planning Department staff. 
C.  After the approval of a Development Plan and prior to the issuance of a building permit, all development within the Cainhoy Zoning District shall be subject to site plan review in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance, unless otherwise exempt by the specific provisions of Section 54-603. The City of Charleston generally recognizes the importance of historic sites as physical links to the past and particularly recognizes the importance of the individual sites and the cultural landscapes of the area included within the bounds of Cainhoy Plantation as significant to the Wando River and Cooper River regions of the Carolina Lowcountry. Therefore, the site plan shall explicitly identify the location of any historic markers, structures, foundations, graveyards or earthworks and mark these accordingly. At the time of submission of a preliminary site plan, the intended use or uses of such property shall be indicated on such site plan or on a separate submission to the Technical Review Committee of the City of Charleston, and such development shall be subject to the area, height, setback and other requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance for the District most nearly approximating such intended use as determined by the zoning administrator at the time of the submission. For purposes of this subsection, the determination by the zoning administrator of the area, height, setback and other requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance shall be ministerial rather than discretionary in nature. The area addressed within each site plan review need not include all of the area of the Development Plan. 
D.  Notwithstanding the flexible nature of the Cainhoy Zoning District and the variety of uses permissible within the Cainhoy Zoning District, the building and other standard code requirements of the City of Charleston for any property within the Cainhoy Zoning District shall be governed by the actual use of such property. 
E.  (1) All property within the Cainhoy Zoning District shall be excluded from the bird sanctuary provisions of Section 5-22 of the general Ordinances of the City of Charleston to the extent such Ordinance prohibits the hunting of Game Birds, as such term is defined under Section 50-1-30(1) of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, as amended. The hunting of Game Birds shall be allowed within any property zoned Cainhoy Zoning District, subject, however, to the terms and provisions of this Section. The hunting, shooting, trapping or destruction of Nongame Birds, as defined in Section 50-1-30(3) of the South Carolina Code of Laws, shall be prohibited within such Cainhoy Zoning District. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary of the general Ordinances of the City of Charleston, the hunting of Game Birds and Game Animals, as defined in Section 50-1-30(4) of the South Carolina Code of Laws, 1976, as amended, and the discharge of recreational firearms within properties zoned Cainhoy Zoning District shall be permitted, subject, however, to the following. 
(a)  All such hunting shall be subject to the game and hunting statutes, Ordinances, laws and regulations of the State of South Carolina and the County of Berkeley; and 
(b)  No such hunting shall take place on any lands containing less than 100 contiguous acres under common ownership or control. 
F.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 54-821 of the Zoning Ordinances of the City of Charleston, or any other provision of the general Ordinances of the City of Charleston, dirt, ROC or pervious surface roads (collectively "Dirt Roads") may be utilized in any residential subdivision within properties zoned Cainhoy Zoning District so long as such residential subdivision shall have a maximum overall density of 0.33 dwelling units per acre. For purposes of this subsection, per acre density shall be determined by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of dwelling units in the applicable residential development or residential neighborhood ("Units") and the denominator of which shall be the entire residential land mass, which is the residential development acreage (the "Project Acreage"). All open space areas, road rights-of-way, freshwater wetlands, common areas, amenity areas, or areas within such development encumbered by conservation easements or deeded to property owner's associations or land conservation organizations shall be included in the total land mass area calculation, but marshland and areas below the South Carolina Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Critical Line shall be excluded from such calculations. Dwelling units and land mass in other residential developments, whether adjacent to or in the vicinity of the Project Acreage, shall not be included in such calculations. All such roads shall be constructed in accordance with City of Charleston standards for such Dirt Roads and shall be private. In the event future development increases the density of the Project Acreage to a level greater than 0.33 dwelling units per acre, all such Dirt Roads, including access roads, shall be improved by the Owner to City Standards. 
G.  (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3: Part 6, 7 & 8 of the Zoning Ordinances of the City of Charleston, all lands within the Cainhoy Zoning District which are developed for light or heavy industrial uses or developed as golf courses shall be exempt from all provisions of such Article 3: Part 6, 7 & 8 with the exception of Section 54-347 and Section 54-348; provided, however, that no protected tree or grand tree may be removed from any such light or heavy industrial property without the prior approval of the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall approve any such removal where any of the following conditions exist: 
(a)  The protected tree or grand tree is located within the proposed footprint of any building or other structure to be constructed within such property, or within twenty-five feet (25) of such building, accessory structure or other improvement. No tree survey shall be required for the footprint of any light or heavy industrial building, or other structure; or 
(b)  The protected tree or grand tree is located in the path of any public or private street, road, driveway or other right-of-way and the zoning administrator determines that no other reasonable design or economically reasonable alternative exists to save the tree; or 
(c)  The protected tree or grand tree creates unsafe vision on a public street or right-of-way as defined by Section 54-351; or 
(d)  With respect to parking areas and walkways, the zoning administrator determines that no other reasonable design or economically reasonable alternative exists to save the tree; or 
(e)  The removal of such protected tree or grand tree is otherwise permitted under Article 3: Part 6 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
(2)  The provisions of Article 3: Part 6, 7 & 8 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Charleston shall apply to all lands within the Cainhoy Zoning District which are developed for uses other than light or heavy industrial uses or golf courses, except that the removal of any protected tree or grand tree shall be approved if the zoning administrator finds that the protected tree or grand tree is located within the proposed footprint of any general commercial building or accessory structure and the zoning administrator determines that no other reasonable design or economically reasonable alternative exists to save the tree. 
H.  Land which is located within one thousand feet (1,000') of the Wando River and Beresford Creek, as measured from the Critical Line adjacent to such waterway as established by the South Carolina Office of Ocean and Coastal Resources Management, shall not be used for light industrial or heavy industrial uses. 
I.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the general Ordinances or Zoning Ordinances of the City of Charleston to the contrary, the following uses shall be exempt from the provisions of Article 3: Part 6, 7 & 8 the City of Charleston Zoning Ordinance, and shall be allowable within any property zoned Cainhoy Zoning District: 
(a)  Commercial Timber Operations , including the cutting and harvesting of trees and forests. 
(b)  Commercial Tree Operations , including the growing of trees specifically for sale by commercial nurseries. 
(c)  Agriculture Uses. Any bona fide agricultural use shall be allowable. 
(d)  Silviculture, Horticulture and Nursery Operations. 
J.  All nonresidential development which is adjacent to residential development with the Cainhoy Zoning District shall require landscaped buffers along common boundary lines with such residential development, as follows: 
(a)  Office and commercial development shall require a minimum buffer of fifty feet (50') in width. 
(b)  Warehousing, shipping, light manufacturing and other types of light industrial uses shall require a building setback and landscaped buffer of 100 feet from adjacent residential uses. 
(c)  Heavy industrial uses shall require a building setback from adjacent residential uses of 300 feet, of which the first 200 feet shall be a landscaped buffer. 
For purposes of this subsection, landscaped buffer areas shall mean a natural or a landscaped vegetative buffer intended to separate and screen incompatible land uses from one another. 
K.  All light and heavy industrial uses shall require a building setback five hundred feet (500') from the Saint Thomas Church property line, as it exists at the adoption of this Ordinance, and a two-hundred-foot (200') natural buffer adjacent to such property line, within which an access road or roads may be constructed. No building shall be constructed having a height in excess of fifty feet (50') within one thousand (1,000) feet of Saint Thomas Church. 
L.  For all Industrial uses, prior to the widening of Clements Ferry Road (Road 33), there shall be a landscaped buffer of one hundred feet (100'). After the widening of Clements Ferry Road, there shall be a landscaped buffer of seventy-five feet (75').

The development guidelines listed below incorporate the original guidelines adopted by Charleston County with updates to reflect the neighborhood as it currently exists. 
II. - Land uses. 
The Hemmingwood PUD consists of 63 single-family detached homes, two ponds and a park common area. Landscape buffers 30 feet in width run along Dogwood Road and Pierpont Avenue.
