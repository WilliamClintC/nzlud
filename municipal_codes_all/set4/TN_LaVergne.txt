PREFACE 

The City of La Vergne Code contains the codification and revision of theordinances of the City of La Vergne, Tennessee.  By referring to the historicalcitation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the originof each particular section.  The absence of a historical citation means that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical citation indicates significant modification of the original ordinance. 
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections.  Related matter is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title.  Each section number is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, andthe section of the chapter of which it is a part.  Specifically, the first digit, followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number.  The second digit identifies thechapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number.  For example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106. 
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title andchapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations includedas footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to anyquestion that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, TaxAssessments, etc...) do not appear in the code.  Likewise, ordinances that have been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here.  Therefore, the user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for acomprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances. 
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,if any, prescribed by the city's charter. 
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitatekeeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following conditions: 
(1) 
That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or whichshould be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deletingspecific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).

(2) 
That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in aseparate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually. 

(3) 
That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in theMTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.


iii 
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacementpages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by suchordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often ifjustified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be suppliedwith detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the codecomplete and up to date. 
The able assistance of the codes team: Emily Keyser, Linda Winstead,Nancy Gibson, and Doug Brown, Administrative Specialists, is gratefullyacknowledged.

It is important that both citizens and employees are protected fromthe transmission of diseases just as it is equally important that neither isdiscriminated against because of basic misconceptions about various diseasesand illnesses. 
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive set of rules andregulations governing the prevention of discrimination and potentialoccupational exposure to Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Tuberculosis (TB). (1994 Code, § 4-401) 
4-402. Coverage. Occupational exposures may occur in many ways,including needle sticks, cut injuries or blood spills.  Several classes of employeesare assumed to be at high risk for blood borne infections due to their routinelyincreased exposure to infectious materials from potentially infected individuals.

4-404. Definitions. (1) "Body fluid" - fluids that have been recognizedby the Center for Disease Control as directly linked to the transmission of HIVand/or HBV and/or to which universal precautions apply: blood, semen, bloodproducts, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid,amniotic fluid, and concentrated HIV or HBV viruses. 

(2) 
"Exposure" - the contact with blood or other potentially infectiousmaterials to which universal precautions apply through contact with openwounds, non-intact skin, or mucous membranes during the performance of anindividual's normal job duties.

(3) 
"Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)" - a serious blood-borne virus withpotential for life-threatening complications. Possible complications include:massive hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic active hepatitis, andhepatocellular carcinoma.

(4) 
"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)" - the virus that causesacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted through 

sexual contact and exposure to infected blood or blood components andperinatally from mother to neonate.

(5) 
"Tuberculosis (TB)" - an acute or chronic communicable diseasethat usually affects the respiratory system, but may involve any system in thebody. 

(6) 
"Universal precautions" - refers to a system of infectious diseasecontrol which assumes that every direct contact with body fluid is infectious andrequires every employee exposed to direct contact with potentially infectiousmaterials to be protected as though such body fluid were HBV or HIV infected. (1994 Code, § 4-404) 


4-405. Policy statement. All blood and other potentially infectiousmaterials are infectious for several blood-borne pathogens. Some body fluidscan also transmit infections. For this reason, the Center for Disease Control developed the strategy that everyone should always take particular care whenthere is a potential exposure. These precautions have been termed "universal precautions."
Universal precautions stress that all persons should be assumed to beinfectious for HIV and/or other blood-borne pathogens. Universal precautionsapply to blood, tissues, and other potentially infectious materials.  Universal precautions also apply to semen, (although occupational risk or exposure is quitelimited), vaginal secretions, and to cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, peritoneal,pericardial and amniotic fluids. Universal precautions do not apply to feces,nasal secretions, human breast milk, sputum, saliva, sweat, tears, urine, andvomitus unless these substances contain visible blood. (1994 Code, § 4-405) 
4-406. General guidelines. General guidelines which shall be used byeveryone include:
(1) 
Think when responding to emergency calls and exercise commonsense when there is potential exposure to blood or other potentially infectiousmaterials which require universal precautions.

(2) 
Keep all open cuts and abrasions covered with adhesive bandageswhich repel liquids.

(3) 
Soap and water kill many bacteria and viruses on contact.  If hands are contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials to whichuniversal precautions apply, then wash immediately and thoroughly. Handsshall also be washed after gloves are removed even if  the gloves appear to beintact. When soap and water or handwashing facilities are not available, thenuse a waterless antiseptic hand cleaner according to the manufacturersrecommendation for the product.

(4) 
All workers shall take precautions to prevent injuries caused byneedles, scalpel blades, and other sharp instruments.  To prevent needle stickinjuries, needles shall not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand,removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand.  After 

they are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades and other sharpitems shall be placed in puncture resistant containers for disposal.  The puncture resistant container shall be located as close as practical to the use area. 

(5) 
The city will provide gloves of appropriate material, quality andsize for each affected employee. The gloves are to be worn when there is contact(or when there is a potential contact) with blood or other potentially infectiousmaterials to which universal precautions apply:


(a) While handling an individual where exposure is possible; 
(b) 
While cleaning or handling contaminated items or equipment;

(c) 
While cleaning up an area that has been contaminated withone of the above; Gloves shall not be used if they are peeling, cracked, or discolored, or if


they have punctures, tears, or other evidence of deterioration.  Employees shallnot wash or disinfect surgical or examination gloves for reuse.
(6) 
Resuscitation equipment shall be used when necessary.  (Notransmission of HBV or HIV infection during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation hasbeen documented.) However, because of the risk of salivary transmission ofother infectious diseases and the theoretical risk of HIV or HBV transmission during artificial resuscitation, bags shall be used. Pocket mouth-to-mouth resuscitation masks designed to isolate emergency response personnel fromcontact with a victims' blood and blood contaminated saliva, respiratorysecretion, and vomitus, are available to all personnel to provide or potentiallyprovide emergency treatment.

(7) 
Masks or protective eyewear or face shields shall be worn duringprocedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other potentiallyinfectious materials to prevent exposure to mucous membranes of the mouth,nose, and eyes. They are not required for routine care.

(8) 
Gowns, aprons, or lab coats shall be worn during procedures thatare likely to generate splashes of blood or other potentially infectious materials. 

(9) 
Areas and equipment contaminated with blood shall be cleaned assoon as possible. A household (chlorine) bleach solution (1 part chlorine to 10parts water) shall be applied to the contaminated surface as a disinfectant leaving it on for a least 30 seconds. A solution must be changed and re-mixedevery 24 hours to be effective.

(10) 
Contaminated clothing (or other articles) shall be handled carefullyand washed as soon as possible. Laundry and dish washing cycles at 120E are adequate for decontamination.

(11) 
Place all disposable equipment (gloves, masks, gowns, etc...) in aclearly marked plastic bag. Place the bag in a second clearly marked bag (double bag). Seal and dispose of by placing in a designated "hazardous" dumpster. NOTE: Sharp objects must be placed in an impervious container andproperly dispose of the objects. 

(12) 
Tags shall be used as a means of preventing accidental injury orillness to employees who are exposed to hazardous or potentially hazardousconditions, equipment or operations which are out of the ordinary, unexpectedor not readily apparent. Tags shall be used until such time as the identifiedhazard is eliminated or the hazardous operation is completed.


All required tags shall meet the following criteria:
(a) 
Tags shall contain a signal word and a major message.  The signal word shall be "BIOHAZARD", or the biological hazard symbol. Themajor message shall indicate the specific hazardous condition or theinstruction to be communicated to employees.

Notify the Infectious Disease Control Coordinator of the contactincident and details thereof. 

(2) 
Complete the appropriate accident reports and any other specificform required.

Once an exposure has occurred, a blood sample should be drawn afterconsent is obtained from the individual from whom exposure occurred and testedfor Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or antibody to humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV antibody). Testing of the source individual shouldbe done at a location where appropriate pretest counseling is available. Post-testcounseling and referral for treatment should also be provided.  (1994 Code,§ 4-408) 
4-409. Hepatitis B virus post-exposure management. For an exposure to a source individual found to be positive for HBsAg, the worker whohas not previously been given the hepatitis B vaccine should receive the vaccineseries. A single dose of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is alsorecommended, if it can be given within seven (7) days of exposure.
For exposure from an HBsAg-positive source to workers who havepreviously received the vaccine, the exposed worker should be tested forantibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and given one dose ofvaccine and one dose of HBIG if the antibody level in the worker's blood sampleis inadequate (ie., 10 SRU by RIA, negative by EIA).
If the source individual is negative for HBsAg and the worker has notbeen vaccinated, this opportunity should be taken to provide the hepatitis Bvaccine series. HBIG administration should be considered on an individual basis when the source individual is known or suspected to be at high risk ofHBV infection. Management and treatment, if any, of previously vaccinatedworkers who receive an exposure from a source who refuses testing or is notidentifiable should be individualized. (1994 Code, § 4-409) 
4-410. Human immunodeficiency virus post-exposure management. For any exposure to a source individual who has AIDS, who isfound to be positive for HIV infection, or who refuses testing, the worker shouldbe counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluated clinically andserologically for evidence of HIV infection as soon as possible after the exposure. The worker should be advised to report and seek medical evaluation for anyacute febrile illness that occurs within 12 weeks after the exposure.  Such an illness, particularly one characterized by fever, rash, or lymphadenopathy, maybe indicative of recent HIV infection. 
Following the initial test at the time of exposure, seronegative workersshould be retested 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after exposure to determinewhether transmission has occurred. During this follow-up period (especially thefirst 6 - 12 weeks after exposure) exposed workers should follow the U.S. PublicHealth service recommendation for preventing transmission of HIV.  These include refraining from blood donations and using appropriate protection during sexual intercourse. During all phases of follow-up, it is vital that workerconfidentiality be protected.
If the source individual was tested and found to be seronegative, baselinetesting of the exposed worker with follow-up testing 12 weeks later may beperformed if desired by the worker or recommended by the health care provider. If the source individual cannot be identified, decisions regarding appropriatefollow-up should be individualized. Serologic testing should be made availableby the city to all workers who may be concerned they have been infected withHIV through an occupational exposure. (1994 Code, § 4-410) 
4-411. Disability benefits. Entitlement to disability benefits and anyother benefits available for employees who suffer from on-the-job injuries willbe determined by the Tennessee Worker's Compensations Bureau in accordancewith the provisions of T.C.A. 50-6-303.  (1994 Code, § 4-411)

(3) 
Prescription medication. Likewise, the use of prescriptionmedication (beyond a single dose for minor injury or discomfort) is consideredmedical treatment.

The provisions ofthis chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation orrestriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexuallyoriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter torestrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by theFirst Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors ofsexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution ofobscene material. 
(2) Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondaryeffects of adult uses on the community presented in reports made available tothe council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres,426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 111 S. Ct. 2456 (1991), TriplittGrille, Inc. v. City of Akron, 40 F. 3d 129 (6th Cir. 1994), and Northend Cinema,Inc. v.

(a) 
Sexually oriented businesses in the listed cities have lentthemselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that arepresently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments.  Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these types ofestablishments responsible for the activities that occur on the premisesin the City of La Vergne, Tennessee.

(b) 
Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses definedin this chapter as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidentof certain types of sexually oriented behavior at these businesses thanemployees of other establishments.

(c) 
Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occurat sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private orsemi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sexshows, as defined under this chapter as adult book stores, adult noveltyshops, adult video stores, adult motion picture theatres, or adult arcades.

(d) 
Offering and providing such space, encourages suchactivities, which create unhealthy conditions.

(e) 
Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, adultcabarets, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose ofengaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.

(f) 
At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread byactivities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but notlimited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection(AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonellainfections and shigella infections.

(g) 
As of December 31, 2002, there have been 9,924 reportedcases of persons with HIV/AIDS living in the State of Tennessee.

(h) 
The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis inthe United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reportedin 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990.

(i) 
The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United Statesreported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half millioncases being reported in 1990.

(j) 
The surgeon general of the United States in his report ofOctober 22, 1986 has advised the American public that AIDS and HIVinfection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drugabuse, exposure to infected blood or blood components, and from aninfected mother to her newborn. 

(k) 
According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIVinfection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmittedby sexual acts.

(l) 
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses areunhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, 

and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and thefailure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate thoseactivities and maintain those facilities. 

(m) 
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semenis found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view"adult" oriented films.

If the city administrator or his designee determines that significanterosion or related problems are occurring on a graded site despite approvedprotective practices, he shall require the permit holder to take additionalcorrective actions to protect the adversely affected area. The specifications of theadditional measures shall be part of the amended erosion and sediment controlplan. 
If it is determined that the permit holder has failed to comply with theapproved plan, the inspector shall immediately serve upon the owner, developer,or contractor, a correction notice setting forth the measures needed to come intocompliance and specifying a time for such compliance. Failure to comply withinthe time specified shall subject permittee to revocation of the permit, and heshall be deemed in violation of the chapter requirements and subject to thepenalties provided therein.
Stormwater discharges coming from a permitted site with anobjectionable color contrast to receiving waters could also be in violation to theStormwater Management Ordinance, title 14 chapter 6 of the municipal code.(1994 Code, § 14-306, as replaced by Ord. #2011-24, Oct. 2011) 
14-307. General criteria. The following general criteria are minimumrequirements for controlling erosion and sedimentation from land-disturbingactivities and should be satisfied in each approved erosion-sediment controlplan. No permit issued using the general criteria is intended to restrict the useof other innovative practices or modifications to the specified practices if suchpractices are thoroughly described and detailed and approved given as part ofa supplement to the approved plan prior to installation.
(1) 
Establishment of permanent vegetation. A permanent vegetativecover shall be established on disturbed areas not otherwise permanentlystabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until aground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of the city administrator or hisdesignee, is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to surviveseasonal weather conditions. If it is determined by the city administrator thatthe vegetation will not withstand seasonal weather conditions, the release ofunobligated monies or bonds shall be determined by the board of adjustmentsand appeals.

(2) 
Protection of adjacent properties. Properties adjacent to the site ofland disturbance shall be protected from sediment deposition. This may beaccomplished by preserving a well vegetated buffer stip around the lowerperimeter of the land disturbance, by installing perimeter controls such assediment barriers, filters, or dikes, or sediment basins, or by a combination ofsuch measures. 

Vegetated buffer strips may not be used alone.

(3) 
Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes must be designed andconstructed in a manner which will minimize erosion. Consideration must be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the soil type, upslope drainage 


area, groundwater conditions, and other applicable factors. Slopes which arefound to be eroding excessively within one (1) year of the construction must beprovided with additional slope stabilizing measures until the problem iscorrected. 
The following guidelines are provided to aid site planners and planreviewers in developing an adequate design.
(a) 
Topsoil for the area should be stockpiled and then used forreplacement on the graded area.

(b) 
Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smoothsurface on slopes.

(c) 
Diversions should be constructed at the top of long steepslopes which have significant drainage areas above the slope. Diversionsor terraces may also be used to reduce slope length.

(d) 
Concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down or out of fill slopes unless contained within an adequate temporaryor permanent channel, flume, or slope drain structure.

(e) 
Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or otherprotection should be provided.


(4) 
Protection of storm sewer inlets. All storm sewer inlets which are made operable during construction shall be protected so that sediment-ladenwater is necessary, precautions must be taken to stabilize the work area duringconstruction to minimize erosion. 

(5) 
Work in stream channel. The channel (including bed and banks)must always be re-stabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed.

Where a live (wet) water course must be crossed by construction vehiclesregularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing must be provided,the design of which must be approved by the city administrator or his designee.

(6) 
Underground utility construction. The construction of undergroundutility lines shall be subject to the following criteria:

(a) 
No more than five hundred feet (500') of open trench will beallowed at one time. 

(b) 
Where consistent with safety and space considerations,excavated materials are to be placed on the uphill side of trenches.

(c) 
Trench dewatering devices shall discharge in a mannerwhich will not adversely affect flowing streams, drainage systems, oroffsite property.



(7) 
Construction access routes. Off-site vehicle tracking of sedimentsand the generation of dust shall be minimized. A stabilized construction access(a point of entrance/exit to a construction site) shall be described andimplemented, as needed, to reduce the tracking of mud and dirt onto publicroads by construction vehicles. The design of the construction access should ata minimum, be consistent with the requirements and recommendationscontained in the current edition of the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control 

Handbook. Where sediment is transported onto a public road surface, the roads,shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day or more often if deemednecessary. Sediment shall be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping andbe transported to a sediment-controlled disposal area. Street washing shall beallowed only after sediment is removed in this manner.

(8) 
Disposition of temporary measures. All temporary erosion andsediment-control measures shall be disposed of within thirty (30) days after finalsite stabilization is achieved or after the temporary measures are no longerneeded, unless otherwise authorized by the city manager or his designee.Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas resulting from the dispositionof temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent furthererosion and sediment. 

(9) 
Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment-control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed by property ownersto assure continued performance of their intended function, as determined bythe city administrator or his designee.

(10) 
The construction-phase erosion prevention controls shall be designed to eliminate (or minimize if complete elimination is not possible) thedislodging and suspension of soil in water. Sediment controls shall be designedto retain mobilized sediment on site to the maximum extent practicable.

(11) 
The design, inspection, and maintenance of Best ManagementPractices (BMPs) as described in the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan(SWPPP) must be prepared in accordance with good engineering practices and,at a minimum, shall be consistent with the requirements and recommendationscontained in the current edition of the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook. In addition, all control measures must be properly selected, installed,and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications (whereapplicable). All control measures selected must be able to slow runoff so that rilland gully formation is prevented.

(12) 
Off-site sediment. If sediment escapes the permitted area, off-siteaccumulations of sediment that have not reached a stream must be removed at a frequency sufficient to maximize off-site impacts (e.g. fugitive sediment thathas escaped the construction site and has collected in a street must be removedso that it is not subsequently washed into storm sewers and streams by the nextrain and/or so that it does not pose a safety hazard to users of public streets). Aland disturbance permit does not authorize access to private property.Arrangements concerning removal of sediment on adjoining property must besettled by the permittee with the adjoining landowner.

(13) 
Sediment removal. Sediment should be removed from sediment traps, silt fences, sedimentation ponds, and other sediment controls asrecommended in the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, and must be removed when design capacity has been reduced by fifty percent (50%).

(14) 
Removal of vegetation. Pre-construction vegetative ground covershall not be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior 


to grading or earth moving unless the area is seeded and/or mulched ortemporary cover is installed.
Clearing and grubbing must be held to the minimum necessary forgrading and equipment operation. Existing vegetation at the site should bepreserved to the maximum extent practicable.
(15) Construction phasing. Construction phasing is required on allprojects regardless of size as a major practice for minimizing erosion andlimiting sedimentation. Construction must be phased to keep the total disturbedarea less than fifty (50) acres at any one time. Areas of the completed phasemust be stabilized within fifteen (15) days. No more than fifty (50) acres ofactive soil disturbance is allowed at any time during the construction project.This includes off-site borrow or disposal areas.
The fifty (50) acre limitation does not apply to linear construction projects(such as roadway, pipeline, and other infrastructure construction activities) ifthe following conditions are met:
(a) 
Where no one (1) area of active soil disturbance is greaterthan fifty (50) acres and the various areas of disturbance have distinctreceiving waters; or

(b) Where contiguous disturbances amount to greater than fifty

(50)
 acres, but no one (1) district water is receiving run off from morethan fifty (50) disturbed acres; or

(c) 
With the department's written concurrence, where morethan fifty (50) acres of disturbance is to occur and where one (1) receivingwater will receive run-off from more than fifty (50) acres; or

(d) 
Where no one (1) area of active soil disturbance is greaterthan fifty (50) acres and the various areas of disturbance are more thanfive (5) miles apart.


In order for a linear project to take advantage of the fifty (50) acrerule exemption outlined in this subsection, the contractor shall conductmonthly site assessments until the site is permanently stabilized.
(16) 
Erosion prevention and sediment control measures must be in placeand functional before earth moving operations begin, and must be constructedand maintained throughout the construction period. Temporary measures maybe removed at the beginning of the workday, but must be replaced at the end ofthe workday.

(17) 
Stabilization. Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as possible in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily orpermanently ceased. Temporary or permanent soil stabilization at theconstruction site (or a phase of the project) must be completed no later thanfifteen (15) days after the construction activity in that portion of the site hastemporarily or permanently ceased.


In the following situations, temporary stabilization measures are notrequired: 
(a) 
Where the initiation of stabilization measures is precludedby snow cover or frozen ground conditions or adverse soggy groundconditions, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable; or

(b) 
Where construction activity on a portion of the site istemporarily ceased, and earth disturbing activities will be resumedwithin fifteen (15) days.Steep slopes shall be temporarily stabilized not later than seven (7) days


after construction activity on the slope has temporarily or permanently ceased.
Permanent stabilization with perennial vegetation (using nativeherbaceous and woody plants where practicable) or other permanently stable,non-eroding surface shall replace any temporary measures as soon aspracticable. Unpacked gravel containing fines (silt and clay sized particles) orcrusher runs will not be considered a non-eroding surface.
(18) 
Design of erosion and sediment control measures. Erosion prevention and sediment control measures must be prepared in accordance withgood engineering practices and the latest edition of the Tennessee Erosion andSediment Control Handbook. In addition, erosion prevention and sedimentcontrols shall be designed to minimize erosion and maximize sediment removalresulting from a 2-year, 24-hour storm, as a minimum, either from total rainfallin the designated period or the equivalent intensity as specified on the followingwebsite http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/tn_pfds.html. When clay andother fine particle soils are present at the construction site, chemical treatmentmay be used to minimize amount of sediment being discharged. For construction sites discharging into a water body on the list of impaired watersor waters designated by TDEC as exceptional Tennessee waters shall bedesigned to minimize erosion and maximize sediment removal resulting from a5-year, 24-hour storm, as a minimum, either from total rainfall in thedesignated period or the equivalent intensity as specified on the followingwebsite http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/tn_pfds.html.

(19) 
Sediment basin. For an on-site outfall which receives drainagefrom ten (10) or more acres, a minimum sediment basin volume that will providetreatment for a calculated volume of runoff from a 2-year, 24-hour storm andrunoff from each acre drained, or equivalent control measures as specified in theTennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, shall be provided untilfinal stabilization of the site. For construction sites discharging into a waterbody on the list of impaired waters or waters designated by TDEC asExceptional Tennessee waters a minimum sediment basin volume that willprovide treatment for a calculated volume of runoff from a 5-year, 24-hour stormand runoff from each acre drained, or equivalent control measures as specifiedin the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, shall be provideduntil final stabilization of the site.  A drainage area of ten (10) or more acresincludes both disturbed and undisturbed portions of the site or areas adjacentto the site, all draining through the common outfall. 

(20)

(3) 
Written applications. All applications for an exception shall be inwriting, and shall contain sufficient information for evaluation of each of thefactors to be considered by the authority pursuant to § 18-309(5) hereof.

(4) 
Review by city administrator. All applications for an exception shall be reviewed by the city administrator.  If the application does not containsufficient information for complete evaluation, the city administrator shallnotify the applicant of the deficiencies and request additional information.  The applicant shall have thirty (30) days following notification by the cityadministrator to correct such deficiencies.  This thirty (30) day period may beextended by the authority upon application and for just cause shown.  Uponreceipt of a complete application, the city administrator shall evaluate samewithin thirty (30) days and shall submit his recommendations to the authorityat its next regularly scheduled meeting.

(5) 
Review by authority. The authority shall review and evaluate allapplications for an exception and shall take into account the following factors:

(a) 
The authority shall consider whether or not the applicant issubject to a national pretreatment standard containing dischargelimitations more stringent than those listed and grant an exception onlyif such exception may be granted within limitations of applicable federalregulations.

(b) 
The authority shall consider whether or not the exceptionwould apply to discharge of a substance classified as a toxic substanceunder regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agencyunder the provisions of section 307(a) of the Act (33 USC 1317), and then 

grant an exception only if such exception may be granted with thelimitations of applicable federal regulations.

(c) 
The authority shall consider whether or not the granting ofan exception would create conditions that would reduce the effectivenessof the treatment works taking into consideration the concentration of saidpollutant in the treatment works' influent and the design capability of thetreatment works. 

(d) 
The authority shall consider whether or not the granting ofan exception might cause the treatment works to violate the limitationsin its NPDES permit taking into consideration the concentration of thepollutant and in the treatment works' influent and the demonstratedability of the treatment works to consistently remove such pollutant.

(e) 
The authority shall consider whether or not the granting ofan exception would cause elements or compounds to be present in thesludge of the treatment works which would prevent sludge use or disposalby La Vergne or which would cause La Vergne to violate any regulationpromulgated by EPA under the provisions of section 405 of the Act (33USC 1345).

(f) 
The authority may consider the cost of pretreatment or othertypes of control techniques which would be necessary for the user toachieve effluent reduction, but prohibitive cost alone shall not be thebasis for granting an exception.

(g) 
The authority may consider the age of equipment andindustrial facilities involved to the extent that such factors affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge.

(h) 
The authority may consider the process employed by theuser and process changes available which would affect the quality orquantity of wastewater discharge.

(i) 
The authority may consider the engineering aspects ofvarious types of pretreatment or other control techniques available to theuser to improve the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge.

(j) 
The authority may consider an application for an exceptionbased upon the fact that water conservation measures instituted by theuser or proposed by the user result in a higher concentration of particularpollutants in the wastewater discharge of the user without increasing theamount of mass of pollutants discharged.  To be eligible for an exceptionunder this subparagraph, the application must show that except for waterconservation measures, the applicant's discharge has been or would be incompliance with the limitations on wastewater strength set forthpreviously, provided, however, no such exception shall be granted if theincreased concentration of pollutants in the applicant's wastewater wouldhave a significant adverse impact upon the operation of the POTW.



(6) 
Good management practices required. The authority shall notgrant an exception unless the applicant shall demonstrate to the authority that 

he is utilizing "Good Management Practices" (GMP) to prevent or reduce hiscontribution of pollutants to the POTW.  GMPs include but are not limited to preventative operating and maintenance procedures, schedule of activities,process changes, prohibiting of activities, and other management practices toreduce the quality or quantity of effluent discharged and to control plant siterunoff, spillage, leaks, and drainage from raw material storage.

(7) 
Exception may be granted following review. The authority shallreview the application for an exception at the first regularly scheduled meetingfollowing recommendation of the city administrator. It may grant theapplication for exception with such conditions or limitations as may have beenrecommended by the city administrator without a hearing provided that noperson, including the applicant, shall object thereto, and provided further thatthe authority finds that the granting of the exception with such conditions ashave been recommended by the city administrator will be in compliance with theprovisions of this section.

(8) 
Hearing. In the event that the applicant objects to recommendations of the city administrator concerning conditions to be imposedupon the applicant, the authority desires a hearing to further investigate thematter, or any interested party granted permission by the authority to interveneobjects to the granting of the exception, then in such event the authority shallschedule a hearing within ninety (90) days following presentation of the matterby the city administrator to resolve such matters.  At such hearing, theapplicant, the city administrator, and any intervening party shall have the rightto present relevant proof by oral or documentary evidence.  The procedure setforth in § 18-313 hereof shall be applicable to such a hearing.  The applicantshall bear the burden of proof in such hearing.

(9) 
Additional costs and expense. The city administrator may requireany person discharging substances in strengths greater than those permitted bythis chapter to pay any additional costs or expense incurred by Metro fortransmission and treatment of such substances. 


The treatment system shall be reviewed at the end of each fiscal year andappropriate surcharge rates applied to the wastewater billing.Such charge for the BOD, suspended solids, and oil and grease will becomputed using the following formula: 
Surcharge ($)/P = 8.34 x (F) x (TC) x (Pa-Pm)Surcharge ($) total = Surcharges of BOD5 + Suspended Solids and GreaseP -Parameter: BOD5 or Suspended Solids or GreaseF -Flow in millions of gallons per dayTC -Treatment costs for servicing POTW per pound of parameter Pa -Parameter, actual Pm -Parameter, maximum 
Charges for other pollutants will be computed on a case by case basis. (1994 Code, § 18-409, as replaced by Ord. #2015-07, May 2015)

B. Application fee 
An applicant for the construction of cellular antenna towers for cellular telecommunications services or personal communications services shall pay an application fee of $1,000.00. 
C. Height and Type 
A cellular antenna tower, or alternative antenna tower structure, may be constructed to a maximum height of 150 feet. This also applies to any tower taller than 15 feet constructed on the top of another building or structure, with the height being the overall height of building/structure and tower together, measured from the grade to the highest point. The Board of Zoning Appeals may allow antennas greater than 150 feet in height upon review of the applicants justification. 
Guyed or lattice towers may only be considered if reasonable justification exists and is provided to planning commission. Monopole towers are required otherwise. 
D. Separation from Other Uses 
The off-site/designated area separation distance from all residential or PDR dwelling units, or vacant residential or PDR lots shall be 200 feet or 300 percent of tower height, whichever is greater. The separation shall be measured from the base of the tower to the closest lot line.

ONLY if data is not available from these sources, then the following provisions (b. &c.) shall apply: 

b. 	
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unlesscertification by registered professional engineer is provideddemonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community.  The engineeringcertification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 

c. 	
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction or substantial improvements of existing shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpededmovements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Section E(2), and Elevated Buildings". 


6. 	Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones) 
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section C(2), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas.  These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1'-3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of floodingis unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
a. 	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, includingbasement, elevated to at least one (1) foot above the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, at least three 
(3) feet above the highest adjacent grade.  Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided inaccordance with standards of Section E(2), and Elevated Buildings". 
b. 	
All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential buildings may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely flood-proofed to at least one (1) foot above the specified FIRM flood level, with wallssubstantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.

a. 	
The City of La Vergne Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this Ordinance. 

b. 	
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition) upon a determination that the proposed repairor rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 

c. 	
In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standardsspecified in other sections of this Ordinance, and: 

i. 	The danger that materials may be swept onto other property to the injury of others; 
ii. 	The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion; 
iii. 	The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage; 
iv. 	
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 

v. 	
The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 


vi. 	The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
vii. 	The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
viii. 	The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinaryand emergency vehicles; 
ix. 	
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site, and; 

x.

e. 	
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 


2. 	Conditions for Variances 
a. 	
Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary, considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 

b. 	
Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and sufficientcause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to publicsafety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or Ordinances. 

c. 	
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for floodinsurance, and that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 

d. 	
The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 


5.056. Overlay Districts. 
A. 	Description 
The purpose of an overlay district is to allow for the application and implementation of special design standards with the intent of achieving a sense of place by fostering a scale and form of development that emphasizes sensitivity to the pedestrian environment, minimizes intrusion of the automobile into the urban setting, and provides for the sensitive placement of open spaces in relationship to building masses, street furniture and landscaping features in a manner otherwise not insured by the application of the conventional bulk, landscaping and parking standards of this title. Application of this special overlay district shall be limited to areas requiring specialized design standards either to maintain and reinforce an established form or character of development, or to achieve a specific design objective for new development.  Any application for an urban design overlay district shall include design goals and objectives that embody this purpose and intent. 
B. 	Overlay Designation 
All overlay districts established by this title shall be made a part of the official zoning map of the City of La Vergne.  An urban design overlay district shall be depicted as a geographical area on the official zoning map.  Boundaries indicated on the official zoning map shall approximately follow platted lot lines or deeded property lines, and shall be interpreted as being coincident with those lines.  In the event that the overlay district encompasses only a portion of the parcel, the portion of the parcel within the overlay shall be required to adhere to the requirements set forth within the overlay. In addition, structures and proposed structures shall be governed by the following: 
1. 	
Any primary structure building footprint that is between 50% to 100% within the overlay boundaries, shall be required to adhere to the overlay requirements. 

2. 	
Any primary structure building footprint that lies less than 50% within the overlay boundary shall be required to meet the overlay requirements for exteriors for the building front.  Any side having road frontage shall also meet the requirements for exteriors.  The exterior allowed to be used for all other sides shall be at the discretion of the planning commission. 


C. 	Permitted Land Uses 
The range of land uses permitted within an urban design overlay district shall be those afforded by the underlying zoning district(s) as established by the zoning district land use. 
D. 	Development Incentives To promote the inclusion of properties within an urban design overlay district for the purpose of achieving specified design objectives, the enacting ordinance may establish development incentives for each district. 
E. 	Amendments to the Overlay District 
The La Vergne Board of Mayor and Aldermen may amend the boundary of the overlay district.  Rezoning applications may be initiated by the property owner and submitted to the La Vergne City Planner. The rezoning procedure and fees shall follow those of a standard rezoning. 
5.056.1 Waldron Road \ Murfreesboro Road Streetscape District. 
A. 	Intent and Purpose 
The purpose of this district is to enhance the development standards for the two major transportation corridors in La Vergne.  This district, when combined with appropriate underlying zoning, intends to encourage pedestrian-oriented commercial areas near residential districts and mixed-use development. Architectural standards shall be applied to both commercial and industrial developments within this district. (Amended by Ordinance #2019-17, June 2019) 
B. 	Design and Development Standards 
For all new development, redevelopment, and major additions within the Waldron Road \ Murfreesboro Road Streetscape District, the following standards apply: 
1. 	Setbacks, Yards, Access, and Parking: 
a. 	
The La Vergne Planning Commission may allow a reduction of setbacks and yards if either the structure will conform with the surrounding structures, or a town center style development is perceived to be suitable for the lot or area.  If allowed, greenspace and landscaping must be added to the front, sides, and rear of the structure(s) per planning commission request. 

b. 	
Rear and side parking is required unless site conditions do not allow, in which case the Planning Commission may exempt the applicant from this requirement. (Amended by Ordinance #2019­17, June 2019) 

c. 	
Site plans for parking lot additions shall only be subject to location requirements of this district. (Amended by Ordinance #2019-17, June 2019) 


2. 	Sidewalks:

In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the 


ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limits prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this Ordinance except as set forth in Section 5.060.3. 
B. 	Existing Uses  No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction of permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this Section or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
C. 	Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed  Whenever the City of La Vergne determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
D. 	Variances  Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this Ordinance, may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of La Vergne for a variance from such regulations.  The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this Ordinance.  Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this Ordinance may be considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Smyrna/Rutherford County Airport Authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance.  If the Smyrna/Rutherford County Airport Authority does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the Board of Zoning Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
E. 	Obstruction Marking and Lighting  Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this Ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owners expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary.  
5.060.7 Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the City of La Vergne to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein.

6.020. Nonconforming Uses. It is the intent of this ordinance to recognize that the elimination, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of the existing buildings and structures of uses that are not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this ordinance.  It is also the intent of this ordinance to so administer the elimination of nonconforming uses, buildings, structures as to avoid an unreasonable invasion of established private property rights.  Lawful nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures existing at the item of the passage of this ordinance or any amendment thereto shall be allowed to remain subject to the following provisions. These provisions areapplicable to all uses which are permitted within the districts in which they area located. 
A.

A change in occupancy orownership shall not, by itself, constitute a change of use. 
B. 	A nonconforming use of land shall be restricted to the area occupied by suchuse as of the effective date of this ordinance.  A nonconforming use of abuilding or buildings shall not be enlarged to additional land after the effective date of this ordinance.

E. 	A nonconforming building or building housing a nonconforming use shall not be structurally altered except in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance.  The provisions shall not be construed to prevent normal maintenance and repairs or alterations required for structural safety. 
F. 	Any commercial or industrial use subject to the provisions of this section shall be allowed to destroy and reconstruct new facilities necessary to the conduct of such operation, provided that no destruction or rebuilding: 
1. 	
shall result in a change of nonconforming use to another nonconforming use; 

2. 	
shall infringe upon, or increase the extent of any infringement existing at the time of this ordinance, upon any open space required by this ordinance; 

3. 	
shall take place upon a zone lot(s) other than that upon which said use was operating as to the effective date of this ordinance. 


G. 	Any commercial or industrial use subject to the provisions of this section shall be allowed to continue in operation and to make such alterations as may prove necessary for the continuation of said use.  However, no alteration may be made which would result in a change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use and further provided that any such alteration permitted hereunder shall take place only upon the zone lot(s) on which said use was operating as of the effective date of this ordinance. 
H. 	Any commercial or industrial use subject to the provisions of this section shall be allowed to continue in operation and to expand provided that no expansion permitted under this section: 
1. 	
shall result in a change of one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use; 

2. 	
shall infringe, or increase the extent or any infringement exiting at the time of adoption of this resolution, upon any open space required bythis ordinance, 

3.

Such lot may be used as a building site,provided, however, that the yard and other requirements of the district are complied with as closely as in the opinion of the Board of Zoning Appeals aspossible. 
B. 	No lot which is not or here after built upon shall be so reduced in area that the yards and open space will be smaller than prescribed by this ordinance, and no yard, court, or open space provided around any building for the purpose ofcomplying with the provisions hereof, shall again be considered as a yard, court, or other open space for another building.

Where two or more lots of record with a continuous frontage are under the same ownership, or where a substandard lot of record has continuous frontage with a larger tract under the same ownership, such lots shall be combined to form one or more building sites meeting the minimum requirements of the district in which they are located. 
6.050. Exceptions to Setback Requirements. The front setback requirements of this ordinance for dwellings shall not apply to any lot where the average depth of existing setbacks on the developed lots located within one hundred (100) feet on each side of such lot is less than the minimum required front yard depth.  In such cases, the front yard setbackmay be less than required but not less than the average of the existing depth for front yardson developed lots within one hundred (100) feet on each side of the lot.  In residential districts, however, the setback shall in no case be less than fifteen (15) feet from the streetright-of-way line. 
6.060. Absolute Minimum Lot Size. In no case shall the Codes Enforcer or the Board of Zoning Appeals permit any lot in a residential district to be used as a building site which is less than the required minimum lot size for that residential district.
