PREFACE

The Travelers Rest, South Carolina Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest.

During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company.

The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion.

In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List."

A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers.

This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. O-12-16, passed November 17, 2016.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE

This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code.

Numbering System.

The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2.

Title.

A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use.

Chapter.

Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney.

Section.

Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering.

Tables of Contents.

There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively.

Ordinance History Note.

At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).)

Beginning with Supplement No. 8 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index.

Statutory References.

The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated.

Cross-Reference Table.

When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein."

As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated.

Ordinance List and Disposition Table.

To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Omitted)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)."

Beginning with Supplement No. 8 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List."

Resolutions will continue to be listed separately on a Resolution List, which organizes resolutions by number and provides a brief description of each.

Code Comparative Table and Disposition List.

Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.

Index.

If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings:

BUSINESS LICENSE

See also BUSINESS TAX
Fee 5.04.030
Required when 5.04.010

The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended.

Instruction Sheet.

Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference.

Page Numbers.

When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 8, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use.

If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

(a)
Municipality. The legislature of the State of South Carolina has in SC Code of Laws, title 5 and title 6, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the City of Travelers Rest, South Carolina does ordain as follows.

(b)
County. The legislature of the State of South Carolina has in SC Code of Laws, title 4, chapters 9 (article 1), 25, and 27, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the County of Greenville, South Carolina does ordain as follows.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.020   Findings of fact.

The special flood hazard areas of the City of Travelers Rest are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.030   Statement of purpose and objectives.

It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the ordinance prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the ordinance are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.

Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.040   Lands to which this chapter applies.

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Travelers Rest as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study, dated August 18, 2014 with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.

Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study for the unincorporated areas of Greenville County, with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.050   Establishment of development permit.

A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.060   Compliance.

No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.070   Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions, shall prevail.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.080   Partial invalidity and severability.

If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the Ordinance shall not be affected and shall remain in force.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.090   Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Travelers Rest or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.100   Penalties for violation.

Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Travelers Rest from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

In all areas of special flood hazard (zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 4.08.040 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local floodplain administrator section 4.08.150, the following provisions are required:

(1)
Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than four feet above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection 4.08.180(4).

(2)
Non-residential construction.

a.
New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than four feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection 4.08.180(4). No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy.

b.
A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in subsection 4.08.140(2)a. A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 4.08.260 of this chapter. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 4.08.260 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The local floodplain administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to it.

(3)
Manufactured homes.

a.
Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than four feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

b.
Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions for residential construction in subsection 4.08.180(1) of this chapter must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower four feet than above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

c.
Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement in accordance with Section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis thirty-six inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six inches in height an engineering certification is required.

d.
An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local floodplain administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator.

(4)
Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.

a.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the following minimum criteria:

1.
Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding.

2.
The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening.

3.
Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area.

4.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.

5.
Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building.

b.
Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundation walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized.

c.
Enclosures below lowest floor.

1.
Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).

2.

(5)
Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 4.08.040, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas:

a.
No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless:

1.
It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local floodplain administrator.

2.
A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development.

(6)
The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of subsection 4.08.180(5) of this chapter.

(7)
Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.270   Considerations.

In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

(1)
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(2)
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(3)
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

(4)
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(5)
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(6)
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;

(7)
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(8)
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;

(9)
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and

(10)
Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.280   Findings.

Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal board, in writing, and included in the application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the department of natural resources, land, water and conservation division, state coordinator's office, must be taken into account and included in the permit file.

(Ord. No. O-10-14, 8-14-2014)

4.08.290   Floodways.

Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order to ensure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the variance is granted the applicant must provide a bond for one hundred percent of the cost to perform the development.

Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances.

(4)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk.

5.28.010   Findings of fact.

(a)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, upstream construction that alters the rate of natural runoffs and the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages.

(Ord. O-04-97 § 4(1), 1997)

5.28.020   Purpose of chapter.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to the health, safety and property due to water or erosion in flood heights or velocities;

(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;

(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and

(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

(Ord. O-04-97 § 4(2), 1997)

5.28.030   Objectives of chapter.

The objectives of this chapter are:

(1)
To protect human life and health;

(2)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

(3)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(4)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(5)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains;

(6)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood height areas; and

(7)
To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(Ord. O-04-97 § 4(3), 1997)

5.28.040   Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section; provided, that unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application:

"Area of special flood hazard" means land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.

"Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

"Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.

"Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

(1)
The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and

(2)
The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

"Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)" means the official map issued by the Federal Insurance Administration where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as Zone A.

"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement areas, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter.

"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.

"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would be equal to or exceeded fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

"Substantial improvements" means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either (1) before the improvement or repair is started; or (2) if the structure has been previously damaged and is being restored, before the flood damage occurred.

For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration on any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.

In special flood hazard areas where the city has not been able to determine base flood elevations, no encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within a distance of the streambank equal to two times the width of the stream at the top of the bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the flood base discharge.

Whenever the city is unable to determine a base flood elevation from other sources in order to administer all new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures, including manufactured homes, shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area is no less than five feet above the highest adjacent natural grade at the building site.

(Ord. O-04-97 § 4(12), 1997)

5.28.130   Alteration of watercourses.

(a)
The city shall notify adjacent communities and the state water resources commission prior to any alteration or such relocation of a watercourse and shall submit evidence of such notification of the federal insurance administration.

(b)
The city shall require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

(Ord. O-04-97 § 4(13), 1997)

5.28.140   Interpretation of boundaries of areas of special flood hazard.

In the event an audit or inspection reveals that false information has been filed by the licensee, the costs of the audit shall be added to the correct license fee and late penalties in addition to other penalties provided herein. Each day of failure to pay the proper amount of license fee shall constitute a separate offense.

(b)
The license inspector shall make systematic inspections and random audits of all businesses within the municipality to insure compliance with this chapter.

(a)
When a person fails to obtain a business license or to furnish the information required by this chapter or the license inspector, the license inspector shall proceed to examine such records of the business or any other available records as may be appropriate and to conduct such investigations and statistical surveys as the license inspector may deem appropriate to assess a license tax and penalties as provided herein.

(b)
A notice of assessment shall be served by certified mail.

Penalties shall not be waived. If any license fee shall remain unpaid for sixty days after its due date, the license inspector shall make a report to the municipal attorney for appropriate legal action.

b.
Partial payment may be accepted by the license inspector to toll imposition of penalties on the portion paid; provided, however, no business license shall be issued or renewed until the full amount of the tax due, with penalties, has been paid.

Whenever the city discovers that two such affiliated businesses are on the existing list, the city administrator shall remove all but the earliest made listing, after providing ten days' written notice to the adversely affected business operations. Such notice shall provide the reason for the removal and provide an opportunity to be heard on the matter.

8.20.030   Qualifications of listed wrecker service.

(a)
No wrecker service may be maintained on the rotation list unless it shall comply with all of the following minimum qualifications:

(1)
The wrecker service shall maintain a safe storage area for all vehicles towed. Such area shall be a locked building or a secured fenced-in area where the stored vehicles and other property shall not be accessible to the public. When the wrecker service uses a fenced-in area, rather than a locked building, then the fence shall be no less than eight feet in total height, provided that up to two feet of the top most portion of such measurement may consist of strands of barbed wire. Further, the fenced-in area shall also have screening consisting of either manufactured material or vegetation, which also shall be at least eight feet high at the time of installation and shall be aesthetically maintained at a minimum height of at least eight feet at all times thereafter.

(2)
All wrecker vehicles shall be equipped with legally authorized lighting and other safety equipment to protect the motoring public. Such equipment shall be maintained in good working order.

(3)
Adequate equipment such as brooms, shovels, etc., must be carried on all wreckers in order to remove glass and other debris from the street, highway, or other site of vehicle disability. The site shall be cleaned by the wrecker service prior to leaving the scene of any accident.

(4)
Each wrecker service shall be deemed responsible for securing personal property in a vehicle at an accident scene as best it can and the wrecker service shall be responsible for reasonably attempting to preserve personal property in a vehicle which is about to be towed from an accident scene. In no event, however, shall a wrecker service be responsible for personal items which do not come into the possession of the wrecker service.

(5)
The wrecker service shall be available on a twenty-four hour basis.

(6)
Each wrecker service shall carry garage keeper's and liability insurance on its wreckers and its premises in such amounts as may be required by council. Each policy shall contain an endorsement providing thirty days' advance notice by the insurer to the city of any change or cancellation.

(7)
Each wrecker service must have its storage facility located in the city or within a one mile radius of the city limits. No wrecker service shall be permitted to be listed as a qualified wrecker service on the city's rotation unless the storage facility complies with this requirement.

(8)
Any wrecker service must have a consistent response time of thirty minutes or less from the time of receiving a call until arrival at the scene of the accident. Delays caused by unforeseeable circumstances shall not be charged against any wrecker service. Any wrecker service which knows it may not be able to meet the response time requirement at the time it receives a call shall notify the caller so that the caller may decide whether to cancel or affirm.

(9)
The wrecker service's name, city or town of domicile, and telephone number shall be painted or otherwise permanently affixed to both sides of the vehicle in letters or numerals at least three inches high and one-half inch wide and shall be plainly readable at a distance of fifty feet.

(A)
The city administrator shall make a systematic inquiry not less than once a year to determine the range in the Travelers Rest area of charges made by competent providers of wrecker services. Upon studying the result, he shall set in writing a maximum amount, or cap, to be charged by wrecker services summoned to a location in the city of Travelers Rest pursuant to the city's rotational list. Such maximum charge shall give due regard to the average, median, highest, and lowest price in his survey as well as the dollar value in the difference between cash.

(B)
The city administrator shall thereupon notify each wrecker service on the list of the maximum charge. Such notice shall be in writing and send by United States Mail, postage pre-paid, not less than ten days before the effective date, which shall be identified in the notice.

(C)
Beginning on the effective date, no wrecker service listed on the city's rotational list shall be allowed to charge more than the maximum charge or cap for services rendered to a customer in response to a call placed by the city on behalf of the customer.

(D)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as preventing any listed wrecker service from charging an amount less than the maximum. Nor shall anything in this section be interpreted to prohibit a city employee from responding to questions from drivers and owners of vehicles regarding the availability of wrecker services or the diversity of charges made by them.

(E)
City council reserves for itself the authority to review the maximum charge as set by the city administrator and to make reasonable adjustments thereto, subject to the same notice requirements specified herein.

(b)
Failure of a wrecker service to comply with the qualifications set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall result in the service being removed from the rotation list following five days' notice by the city.

Findings. Travelers Rest city council finds that "rolling papers" commonly known as "cigarette papers" or "marijuana wraps", are dangerous to the health, safety and welfare of the community.

Furthermore, council finds that the danger to the health, safety and welfare outweighs the interest of individuals who want to use these items for legal tobacco consumption, which in and of itself, is also known to cause serious health problems.

Section 5:9 Planned Development District
5:9.1 Intent
The intent of planned development districts is to derive the benefits of efficiency, economy, and flexibility by encouraging unified development of large sites while also obtaining the advantages of creative site design, improved appearance, compatibility of uses, optimum service by community facilities, and better functioning of vehicular access and circulation. It is the intent of this Ordinance to allow development of large sites subject to specific regulations concerning lot area, building coverage, yard spaces, and building height only in so far as the Travelers Rest City Council shall deem appropriate to fulfill the intent of this Ordinance, upon presentation of certification from the owners, developers, or other parties at interest in the development of such sites that they will adhere to development policies which will fulfill the intent of this Ordinance.
5:9.2 Types of Planned Development Districts
Two types of planned development districts accommodating primarily residential or nonresidential uses are created as follows:
A. PD-R Planned Development - Residential: The PD-R district is intended to accommodate primarily residential uses, with nonresidential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses.
B. PD-C Planned Development - Commercial: The PD-C district is intended to accommodate primarily nonresidential uses, with residential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses.
C. Intent: The types of residential dwelling units, and the types of nonresidential uses allowed to be established in such districts increase with increasing site size of such districts, based upon the premise that increased site size will allow proper design including functional interrelations, buffer treatments separating uses with potentially incompatible characteristics of use, design of access patterns, and relationships of uses within such planned developments with uses in adjacent districts. It is the intent of this Ordinance that such design and planning features be incorporated properly into any PD district hereafter created, and that the Travelers Rest Planning Commission and City Council shall consider the existence and appropriateness of such features before any amendment to the Zoning Map is adopted to create such district.

A. Provide a range of housing types designed for various life stages and lifestyles
B. Ensure multifamily residential development takes place in a manner consistent with the nature, context, scale, and proportion of the natural and built environment within which it is located.
C. Promote compatibility between multifamily residential development and other allowable uses in the city, particularly single-family residential development.
D. Strengthen neighborhoods by incorporating best practice methods for multi-family development, such as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).
E. Establish a minimum level of quality for multifamily residential development.
6:13.2 Applicability.
A. These standards shall apply to all new construction, renovation, or reconstruction of existing structures accommodating three or more dwelling units.
B. Renovation and reconstruction shall be defined as construction activity having a cost that exceeds 20 percent of the current fair market value of the property. In cases where an existing development cannot comply with these standards during renovation or reconstruction, the administrator may rely upon the certification of a licensed architect or structural engineer to verify that compliance is not practicable.
C. In the event of conflict between these design standards or other standards in this chapter, the more stringent or restrictive standard shall apply.
D. Compliance with these standards shall be determined as part of the review for a final development plan, site plan permit, land development permit, building permit, as appropriate.
Plans for a multi family or single family attached development containing three (3) or more dwelling units shall be submitted to the Travelers Rest Planning Commission staff for approval. The plans should include the following data and any other reasonable information the Planning Commission staff may require in its investigation of the plans.
A. The location and size of the site;
B. Density of land use proposed for various parts of the site;
C. The location and size of any roads within the apartment complex;

Section 6:16 Clustered Subdivisions
6:16.1 Intent
This section is established to encourage the preservation of open space, the proliferation of recreational opportunities, and the greater efficiency of public services during the development of residential properties.
Clustering lots within subdivisions allows developers to preserve environmentally critical areas such as wetlands, embankments, and wildlife habitats without decreasing the total density of the subdivision. In addition, preserving open space reduces soil erosion and flooding.
Open space can be designated for recreational purposes. The availability of recreation areas, active or passive, is conducive to a higher quality of life among residents.
By clustering homes together, public services become more efficient as they require less infrastructure. Building fewer roads, water and sewer lines, and other infrastructure helps keep the construction and maintenance of these services associated with them down.
6:16.2 Permitted Density
The overall allowable density of a clustered subdivision may be found in the following table. These numbers were calculated by taking the number of dwelling units per acre permitted in a residential zoning district and rounding down to the nearest tenth of an acre.
Travelers Rest Zoning Ordinance Jan 2020
F-30

The overall density is calculated by taking the total number dwelling units and dividing it by the total number of acres, including both developed and undeveloped land.
6:16.3 Minimum tract and lot requirements
There are no requirements on tract size in order for a residential development to be eligible for clustering. There is no requirement for minimum lot or yard size, unless otherwise required by DHEC, and/or building and fire codes.
6:16.4 Setbacks
Aside from DHEC and/or building and fire codes, the only setbacks associated with clustered subdivisions are those that deal with properties adjacent to the clustered subdivision.
All structures must be setback twenty-five (25) feet from exterior lot lines.
In addition, all structures must be setback from existing roads according to the following table.

6:16.5 Required open space
In order for a subdivision to be eligible for clustering, land must be set aside as open space. All undevelopable land must remain undeveloped.
Undevelopable land includes the following:
1. areas of steep slopes (30% or greater)
2. areas within the 100-year floodplain as designated by FEMA
3. areas that are designated as wetlands
4. areas that are within twenty-five (25) feet of the edge of a waterbody, intermittent or otherwise
5. areas that contain existing utility easements or rights of way with explicit restrictions on development
Travelers Rest Zoning Ordinance Jan 2020
F-31
For each clustered subdivision, twenty-five (25) percent of the total acreage must be designated as composite open space.
Composite open space is calculated with the following formula:
COMPOSITE OPEN SPACE
=
100% of
UNDISTURBED
OPEN SPACE
+
50% of
ALTERED OPEN SPACE
+
25% of
DEVELOPED
COMMON AREA
In order for any area to be included as either undisturbed open space, altered open space, or developed common area, it must meet the following two requirements:
1. All designated open space shall be of meaningful proportions and dimensions so as to be consistent with the intent and purpose of this section.
2. All designated open space areas shall be accessible to all lots. Accessibility may be established by adjacency to a lot or by a pedestrian walkway (i.e. a sidewalk or footpath).
6:16.5-1 Undisturbed open space
Undisturbed open space includes areas where no alteration to the physical landscape or vegetation will take place. Land that is considered undevelopable cannot be included as undisturbed open space, altered open space, or developed common area. During the development process, it may be deemed necessary to replace and/or improve vegetation in undisturbed open areas. Such an alteration is acceptable in undisturbed open spaces. Examples of undisturbed open space include wetlands, forested areas, and shrubbery. All land area designated as undisturbed open space can be counted towards the twenty-five (25) percent open space requirement. Permanent bodies of water, either natural or man-made, may be included as undisturbed open space.
6:16.5-2 Altered open space
Altered open space includes areas where the physical landscape and/or vegetation is altered for the benefit of the community. Although not as beneficial to the environment as undisturbed open space, it often provides more active kinds of recreation for the community and is better for the environment than developed common area. Examples of altered open space include playgrounds, ball fields, and cleared fields. One-half (50%) of all land area designated as altered open space can be counted towards the twenty-five (25) percent open space requirement. Areas designated as water retention areas may be included as altered open space.
6:16.5-3 Developed common area
Developed common areas include locations where community oriented development takes place. Although developed common areas are not as beneficial to the environment as undisturbed or altered open space, these areas provide places for active community oriented recreational areas
Travelers Rest Zoning Ordinance Jan 2020
F-32
that are important components of a residential neighborhood. Examples of developed common areas include community pools, clubhouses, and pavilions. One-fourth (25%) of all the land area designated as developed common areas can be counted towards the twenty-five (25) percent open space requirement.
6:16.5-4 Conversion to Undisturbed open space
During the development process, it may be deemed necessary to replace vegetation in undisturbed open areas.
6:16.6 Open space ownership, dedication, and management
Open space ownership shall be determined by the developer, owner, and/or subdivider. Types of ownership include the following:
1. The City of Travelers Rest, subject to acceptance by the governing body
2. Other jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their acceptance
3. Non-profit or quasi-public organizations committed to the protection and conservation of open space, subject to their acceptance
4. Homeowner or cooperative associations or organizations
5. Shared, undivided interest by all property owners within the subdivision
Section 6:17 Commercial Design Standards
6:17.1 Intent
This section is established to accomplish three goals:
1. to provide protection to residents from poorly designed and aesthetically unattractive commercial developments;
2. to provide the developer with clear standards that their projects must adhere
to; and
3. create design standards without compromising creativity in design for the developer.
To accomplish these goals, this section places regulations on exterior wall design, materials and colors; roof materials and colors; entrances; pedestrian accessibility; landscaping requirements; and screening of outdoor storage, disposal, HVAC equipment and loading operations.
6:17.2 Applicability
This section applies to all new development within commercial zoning districts, including:
O-D, Office District;
C-1, Commercial District;
C-2, Commercial District; and
C-1N, Neighborhood Commercial District
Travelers Rest Zoning Ordinance Jan 2020
F-33
For the C-1N, Neighborhood Commercial District, design requirements specified during their respective plan review processes may exceed the standards specified in this section.
6:17.3 Design Standards
The following standards are intended to be used as a design aid by developers proposing retail developments and as an evaluation tool by the Travelers Rest Planning Commission during their review processes.
6:17.3-1 Aesthetic Character
Intent: Commercial developments have a large impact on the way a community presents itself. As such, commercial development should be designed in a manner that limits negative visual impacts.
Standard: Any side of a building visible from a public or private right-of-way or a low-density residential district (R-15, R-12, R-10, and R-7.5) shall be built in accordance with Section 6:17.3-1.
A. Exterior Walls
Intent: Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest and be consistent with the community’s identity, character, and scale. The intent is to encourage a more human scale that residents of Travelers Rest will be able to identify with their community. The resulting scale will ensure a greater likelihood of reuse of structure by subsequent tenants. The elements in the following standard should be integral parts of the building fabric, not superficially applied trim, graphics, or paint.
Standard: All exterior Developments with an exterior wall over one hundred (100) feet in linear length shall incorporate three different patterned changes at an interval of no more than thirty (30) feet, either horizontally or vertically. Each pattern change must be at least one (1) foot wide. Patterned changes may include the following:
color change, texture change, material change, and wall projections or recesses, at least two (2) feet in depth. At least one of the changes must occur horizontally.
B. Roofs
Intent: Variations in rooflines should be used to add interest to, and reduce the scale of buildings. Roof features should compliment the character of adjoining neighborhoods.
Standard: Rooflines shall be varied with a change in height every one hundred (100) linear feet in the building length. Parapets, mansard roofs, gable roofs, hip roofs, or dormers shall be used
Travelers Rest Zoning Ordinance Jan 2020
F-34
to conceal flat roofs and roof top equipment from public view. Alternating lengths and designs may be acceptable and can be addressed in the Development Plan.
C. Materials
Intent: Exterior building materials comprise a significant part of the visual impact of a building. Therefore, they should be aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and colors used in adjoining neighborhoods.
Standard: Predominant exterior building materials shall be of high quality materials. These include, without limitation:
brick,
wood,
sandstone,
other native stone, and
tinted, textured, concrete masonry units.
Predominant exterior building materials shall not include the following:
smooth-faced concrete block,
tilt-up concrete panels, and
pre-fabricated steel panels.
6:17.3-2 Site Design and Relationship to the Surrounding Community
A. Entrances for Larger Buildings
Intent: Larger commercial buildings should feature multiple entrances. Multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from cars, facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks, and provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores, or identified departments in a store. Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls and neglected areas that often characterize building facades that face bordering land uses.
Standard: Each commercial structure exceeding 25,000 square feet of space shall have two entrances. The two entrances must be located on two different exterior walls that would be most appropriate for access from adjacent parking areas.
B. Entryways
Intent: Entryway design elements and variations should provide orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The standards identify desirable entryway design features.
Standard: Each building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entryways featuring no less than three of the following:
canopies or porticos,
overhangs,
Travelers Rest Zoning Ordinance Jan 2020
F-35
recesses/projections,
arcades,
raised corniced parapets over the door,
peaked roof forms,
arches,
outdoor patios,
display windows,
planters,
wing walls, and
any other architectural detail or feature that accentuates the entryways for the public.
C. Windows for Smaller Buildings
Intent: Smaller retail stores provide an intimate retail experience. It is not uncommon for small retail stores to construct plain buildings with little or no architectural details to provide a sense of human scale. Windows and window displays of such stores should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior facades.
Standard: Each commercial structure not exceeding 25,000 square feet shall incorporate windows into their design. Each exterior wall with an entrance shall have transparent windows between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no less than forty (40) percent of the horizontal length of the exterior wall.
Windows shall be recessed and should include visually prominent sills, shutters, or other forms of framing.
D. Parking Lot Orientation
Intent: Parking areas should provide safe, convenient, and efficient access for vehicles and pedestrians. They should be distributed around large buildings in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks and to reduce the overall scale of the paved surface. If buildings are located closer to the streets, the scale of the complex is reduced, pedestrian traffic is encouraged, and architectural details take on added importance.
Standard: No more than sixty (60) percent of the off-street parking spaces for the entire property shall be located between a single exterior wall and a public or private right-of-way.
E. Nearby Residential Areas
Intent: In general, the introduction of intense commercial uses to nearby low-density residential uses causes a significant land use conflict. As such, any time commercial development is to occur, it must be considered carefully in order to limit the negative impacts the commercial developments would have on the surrounding community.
Standards: When the property is adjacent to single-family residential uses (R-7.5, &-10, R-12, and R-15), an earthen berm shall be installed, no less than 6 feet in height, containing at a
Travelers Rest Zoning Ordinance Jan 2020
F-36
minimum, a double row of evergreen or deciduous trees planted at intervals of 15 feet on center. Additional landscaping may be required by the Planning Commission to effectively buffer adjacent land use as deemed appropriate.
F. Outdoor Storage, Trash Collection, Loading Areas and Utility Areas
Intent: Areas associated with outdoor storage, trash collection, loading, and utilities often exert visual and noise impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. The disturbances created by commercial uses are commonly associated with these specific activities and locations. As such, they should be carefully considered when developed.
Standards: Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection and compaction, loading, or any other similar activities shall:
1. not be visible from the right from any public or private right-of-way;
2. not be located within twenty (20) feet of any public or private street, sidewalk, or internal pedestrian way, and
3. be screened or incorporated with materials and in a manner consistent with the rest of the site, thereby reducing the presence of them.
G. Seasonal Inventory and Sales
Intent: Many commercial establishments utilize parking areas as commercial space during peak times. This practice must be carefully considered.
Standards: Non-enclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences. Materials, colors, and designs of screening walls, fences, and covers shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the buildings.
H. Pedestrian Flows
Intent: Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented developments to the neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development to project a friendlier, more inviting image. This section sets forth standards for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation systems that can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian safety, shelter, and convenience within the site. Due to the scope of large structures, additional steps should be taken to make areas more pedestrian-friendly.
Standards: Sidewalks at least six (6) feet in width shall be provided along all sides of the lot that abut a public or private right-of-way, excluding U.S. Highway 25.
Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than five (5) feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to all customer entrances on sites where the total building(s) square footage exceeds 25,000 square feet. (The square footage of any building(s) located on out parcels divided from the original site shall be included in the calculation of the
Travelers Rest Zoning Ordinance Jan 2020
F-37
total square footage on the site.) At a minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited to, transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry points, and shall feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees, shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground covers, or other such as arcades or entryways are part of the exterior wall. In addition, sidewalks must connect to any existing sidewalk network nearby.
Sidewalks, no less than five (5) feet in width, shall be provided along the full length of the building along any exterior wall featuring a customer entrance, and along any exterior wall abutting public parking areas. For commercial structures exceeding 25,000 square feet, such sidewalks shall be located at least six (6) feet from the exterior wall of the building to provide planting beds for foundation landscaping, except where features such as arcades or entryways are part of the exterior wall.
Internal pedestrian walkways shall provide weather protection features such as awnings or arcades within thirty (30) feet of all customer entrances, constructed parallel to the exterior wall of the building. This is not intended to extend into the driving aisles or parking areas.
All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways.
I. Connectivity
Intent: Limiting the impacts of traffic on the existing road network is important. Limiting the number of curb cuts onto large roads and promoting connectivity between adjacent uses helps to make the transportation system more efficient. The traffic patterns created by new development must be developed in a manner that mitigates the negative impacts of increased traffic demands. Safety and efficient transit are paramount when promoting connectivity.

C. Because of these conditions, the application of the Ordinance to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; and
D. The authorization of a variance will not be a substantial detriment of adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance.
No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.

Section 9:6 Decisions
