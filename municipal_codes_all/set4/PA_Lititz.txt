capable of performing all of the essential functions of the position. Physical medical examinations
shall be under the direction of a physician or other qualified medical professional. Psychological
medical examinations shall be under the direction of a psychiatrist or psychologist.
The physician or other qualified medical professional and the psychiatrist or psychologist shall be

If the opinion rendered by the physician, other qualified medical professional, psychiatrist or
psychologist calls into question the conditional appointee's ability to perform all essential functions

appointee for the purpose of having one or more interactive discussions on whether the
conditional appointee can, with or without reasonable accommodation, perform all of the essential
functions of the position.

8/14/2020 Borough of Lititz, PA Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/LI0684?guid=LI0684&children=true 29/233
§ 7-42. Filing of eligibility list.
As soon as possible after the completion of the ranking process, the eligible list shall be filed in the
office of the Municipal Secretary and copy posted at the Municipal Building. The names on the eligible
list shall be arranged, from highest to lowest, in the order of the final score received by each eligible
applicant.
§ 7-43. Promotional requirements.
For positions of promotion, fulfilling the performance requirements set forth in § 7-23 is also required.
§ 7-44. Breaking tie scores.
When two or more eligible applicants shall receive the same final score, the order in which the names
of such persons shall appear on the eligible list shall be determined by their respective scores on that
part of the examination assigned the greatest weight. In the event that two or more qualifying
applicants also receive identical scores on that part of the examination assigned the greatest weight,
the order of the listing shall be determined by the order in which the applications were numbered for
recording purposes.
§ 7-45. Life of eligible lists.
The eligibility list will be valid for one year from the date the Commission formally adopts the eligibility
list. Prior to the expiration of the one-year period, the Commission may extend the validity of the

authorized Commission meeting. In the absence of a lawful extension by the Commission, the list shall

filled, the Commission shall certify from the top of the list a number of names equal to the number of
vacancies to be filled. No examination, other than a physical examination as directed by the Civil
Service Commission, shall be required in any case of reappointment or reinstatement.
§ 7-49. Certification from eligible lists.
If no furlough list exists or if the total number of vacancies cannot be filled from the available names on
the furlough list, the Commission shall certify for each vacancy from the eligibility list the names of
three persons, or a lesser number where three are not available, who have received the highest
average. The municipal governing body shall make a conditional appointment from the three names
certified, based solely on the merits and fitness of the candidates, unless Borough Council makes
objection to the Commission regarding one or more of the certified persons for any of the reasons
stated in § 7-24. Should the objections be sustained by the Commission, or if the conditional appointee
is determined to be unqualified in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 7-26, the Commission
shall strike the name of the person from the eligibility list and certify the next-highest name for each
name stricken from the eligibility list. As each subsequent vacancy occurs in the same or another
position, precisely the same procedure shall be followed. The number of available eligibles certified
from the eligible list shall exceed by two for each vacancy to be filled from such eligible list. If there are
fewer than three available eligibles on the eligible list, the municipal governing body may make a
selection from such lesser number of available eligibles or may request that the Commission hold
another examination.
§ 7-50. Removal of names from furlough and eligible lists.
In addition to the other reasons stated as grounds for removal in these rules, the name of any
person appearing on a furlough list or an eligible list shall be removed by the Commission if such
person:
Is appointed to a position in the Police Department; or
Declines an appointment to a permanent position in the Police Department; or
Fails to make written reply to the Commission seven calendar days from the date of mailing of
a notice of certification; or
Indicates availability for appointment and is appointed to fill a vacancy but fails to report for
duty at the time prescribed, unless, in the opinion of the municipal governing body, such
person can show good and sufficient reasons for failure to report.
The name of any person on an eligible list also shall be removed by the Commission if certified for
appointment consideration three times as the top name and he/she is not appointed. Nothing in
this section, however, shall be construed as authorizing the removal of the name of a person from
a furlough list or eligible list who refuses or accepts a position of a lower rank than that from which
furloughed or for which eligible on a Commission list.
§ 7-51. Appointment procedures.
Whenever the name of a person is certified from either the furlough list or the eligible list, the person
shall be notified immediately of such certification. The notice shall include the title of the position and
the compensation to be paid and shall request a written reply within seven days from the date of
mailing.

All initial appointments to positions in the Police Department shall be for a probationary period of one
year from the date of appointment. During the probationary period, an appointee may be dismissed
only for a cause specified in § 7-54 or because of incapacity for duty due to the use of alcohol or drugs.
The Chief of Police shall review the adjustment, performance and general acceptability of each
probationer quarterly to determine whether such probationer is fully qualified for permanent
appointment. The Chief of Police shall make a report to the municipal governing body recommending
termination of employment of a police officer found not to be acceptable in his or her position and/or
shall submit a final probationary report, not less than 10 nor more than 15 calendar days before the
next regular meeting of the municipal governing body immediately preceding the end of the
probationary period. Each final probationary report shall include the recommendation of the Chief of
Police to retain the probationer. Each report shall be submitted in writing to the municipal governing
body. Within five calendar days after receiving a probationary report from the Chief of Police
recommending retention or rejection of a probationer, the municipal governing body shall notify the
Commission, in writing, of its decision to retain or remove the probationer. The Commission, in turn,
shall notify the probationer of such decision within five calendar days and in no event beyond the last
day of the probationary period.
§ 7-53. Appointment of Chief of Police.
In the case of a vacancy in the office of Chief of Police, the municipal governing body has full
discretion in selecting the individual to fill the position of Chief of Police. If the municipal governing
body requests the Commission to subject that person to a noncompetitive examination, and if that
person successfully passes the noncompetitive examination, then the Commission shall notify the
municipal governing body of the results of the examination and that person may only be removed
from the position of Chief of Police for reasons set forth in § 7-54.
A Police Chief may be appointed by the municipal governing body without civil service status. If
the municipal governing body takes this route, the individual appointed to Police Chief may be
returned to a prior rank within the Borough of Lititz Police Department if promoted within or
dismissed from an outside appointment, without implicating civil service hearing rights.
Article IX. Suspensions, Removals and Reduction in Rank
§ 7-54. Grounds for disciplinary action.

regulations may be suspended without pay or removed and no person promoted in rank pursuant
to these rules and regulations may be reduced in rank except for the following reasons:
Physical or mental disability affecting the officer's ability to continue in service, in which case
the officer shall receive an honorable discharge from service;
Neglect or violation of an official duty;
A violation of any law which provides that such violation constitutes a misdemeanor or felony;
Inefficiency, neglect, intemperance, immorality, disobedience of orders or conduct
unbecoming an officer;

§ 7-55. Furloughs.
If, for reasons of economy or other reasons, it shall be deemed necessary by the municipal governing
body to reduce the number of full-time police officers in the Department, then the municipal governing
body shall furlough the person or persons, including probationers, last appointed to the force. Such
removal shall be accomplished by furloughing in numerical order commencing with the person last
appointed until such reduction shall have been accomplished. In the event the said police force shall
again be increased, the employees furloughed shall be reinstated in the order of their seniority in the
service. The provisions of this section as to reduction in force are not applicable to Chief of Police.
§ 7-56. Notice of suspension, removal or reduction in rank.
Whenever a police officer is suspended, removed or reduced in rank, the specific charges
warranting such action shall be stated in writing by the municipal governing body. The charges
shall be stated clearly and in sufficient detail to enable the officer to understand the charges and to
allow the officer an opportunity to respond to those charges. The charges shall specify the
subsection of § 7-54 which provides the basis for the disciplinary action as well as an explanation
of the factual circumstances upon which the municipal governing body relied in finding a violation
of § 7-54.
Within five days after the municipal governing body has voted to impose the disciplinary action, a
written statement of the charges shall be delivered to the officer either by personal service or by

under § 7-57 of these rules and regulations. A copy of the statement of charges shall also be
served upon the members of the Commission.
§ 7-57. Hearings on suspensions, removals and reductions in
rank.
The officer who has been suspended, removed or reduced in rank may appeal the decision of the
municipal governing body by written notice to the Secretary at 7 South Broad Street, Lititz,
Pennsylvania, 17543, requesting a hearing. This request shall be received by the Commission
within 10 days after the officer received notice of the discipline. The officer may make written
answers to any charges filed not later than the date fixed for the hearing. Failure of the officer to
provide written answers to any of the charges shall not be deemed an admission by the officer.
The Commission shall grant the officer a hearing within 10 days from the officer's written request
for a hearing, unless continued by the Commission for cause at the request of the Commission,
the municipal governing body or the officer. Notwithstanding this provision, the failure of the

fails to uphold the charges, then the person sought to be suspended, removed or reduced in rank
shall be reinstated with full pay for the period during which the person was suspended, removed or
reduced in rank, and the charges shall be sealed and not be available for public inspection in the
event the charges are dismissed. At any such hearing, the officer against whom the charges have
been made may be present and represented by counsel, may call witnesses and may present
testimony and documentation in defense. The municipal governing body may also be represented
by counsel, call witnesses and present evidence as is necessary to support the charges. A
stenographic record of all testimony shall be taken at every hearing and preserved by the
Commission. In the event the charges are dismissed, the record shall be sealed and not be
available for public inspection. Notice of the date, time and place for each hearing shall be given in
the following manner:
Either by personal service or certified or registered mail to each of the principals involved in
the case; and
By regular, first-class mail to all other persons who have stated an interest in the hearing;
provided, however, that any failure to give the notice required by this subsection shall not
invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Commission.
In conducting the hearing, the Commission's standard of review shall be to determine whether
sufficient evidence has been presented to support the statutory reason for the disciplinary action.
If the Commission finds that sufficient evidence has been introduced to support the charge, the
Commission shall not modify the penalty imposed by the municipal governing body unless it finds
that the penalty imposed was arbitrary, discriminatory or an abuse of the municipal governing
body's discretion. In considering the appropriateness of the discipline, the Commission shall not
substitute its judgment for that of the municipal governing body. The Commission may request
post-hearing briefs and shall issue a written decision containing specific findings of fact and
conclusions of law within 60 days of receipt of the hearing transcript.
Unless the municipal governing body or the person sought to be suspended, removed, or reduced
in rank requests that the proceedings before the Commission be open to the public, the
proceedings before the Commission pursuant to this section shall be held in the nature of a closed
executive session that shall not be open to the public. Any such request shall be presented to the
Commission before the civil service hearing commences. The deliberations of the Commission,
including interim rulings on evidentiary or procedural issues, may be held in private and shall not
be subject to request for being open to the public, the municipal governing body or to the person
sought to be suspended, removed, or reduced in rank. The Commission's disposition of the
disciplinary action shall constitute official action which shall occur at a public meeting held
pursuant to 65 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 7 (relating to open meetings). All parties concerned shall have
immediate right of appeal to the court of common pleas of the county, and the case shall there be
determined as the court deems proper. No order of suspension made by the Commission shall be
for a longer period than one year. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days from the date of entry
by the Commission of its final order and shall be by petition.
§ 7-58. Hearing procedure.
All testimony shall be given under oath administered by the Chairperson, or in the absence of the
Chairperson, the Vice Chairperson of the Commission. The Commission shall have the power to

By Act 45 of 1999, the Pennsylvania Legislature provided for the adoption of a Pennsylvania
Uniform Construction Code and directed the Department of Labor and Industry to promulgate

to adopt and administer the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code and establish administrative

In accordance with Section 302(a) of the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act, this article does
not adopt the International Property Maintenance Code and shall not be considered as a property
maintenance code. All Borough regulations governing the maintenance of properties shall be in
ordinances separate and distinct from the Borough of Lititz Construction Code.
§ 36-3. Adoption of standards.
The Borough hereby adopts the standards which the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry
has made part of the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code identified in § 403.21 of the Labor and
Industry Regulations as the Borough of Lititz Construction Code with the following additions to the
International Building Code/2003:
Labor and Industry Regulations amendments.
Labor and Industry Regulations § 403.21(c) concerning items incorporated into the UCC is
amended to incorporate the provisions of the Borough Building Code in existence as of May
11, 1998, and is amended to include the following regulations:
Private garage fire separation. Private garages shall be separated from the dwelling by
means of 5/8 inch type "X" gypsum board applied to all walls and ceilings of the garage.

listed 20 minute fire-rated steel door. Attic access openings or stairs shall be covered
with a minimum of one layer of 5/8 inch type "X" drywall.

§ 59-10. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
RESIDENTIAL OCCUPANCY
The occupancy or use of a building or structure or any portion thereof by persons for whom
sleeping accommodations are provided, including but not limited to one- and two-family dwellings,
lodging or rooming houses, dormitories, apartment buildings, hotels and single-family attached
and detached dwellings.
§ 59-11. Requirements.
It shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new and existing occupied residential occupancy unit
to install smoke detectors in each such residential occupancy unit as hereinafter provided. Said smoke
detectors shall be capable of sensing visible and invisible particles of combustion and providing a

suitable audible alarm thereof; further, they shall be installed by 150 days after adoption of this article
in the manner hereinafter provided. Failure to install smoke detectors as and where required by said
date will subject the property owner to the penalties set forth in § 59-9 of the Code of the Borough of
Lititz, Pennsylvania.
§ 59-12. Location.
At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each sleeping area. A "sleeping area" is
defined as the area or areas of the residential occupancy unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping
rooms) are located. Where bedrooms or rooms habitually used for sleeping are separated by other
use areas (such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purpose of this section.
At least one smoke detector shall be installed at the head (top) of each stairway leading up to an
occupied area.
§ 59-13. Installation; maintenance; removal or destruction.
In new residential occupancy units, smoke detectors shall be wired directly (hard wired) to the
building's electrical system. In all existing residential occupancy units, it is preferred that the
smoke detectors be wired directly (hard wired) to the building's electrical system; however, a
monitored battery-powered unit is acceptable.
It shall be the responsibility of the homeowner(s) and landlord(s) and tenant(s) to maintain smoke
detectors. Such maintenance shall include keeping smoke detectors serviceable by replacing
batteries when necessary or by keeping them connected to an electrical source so that they
remain capable of transmitting an audible signal in the presence of smoke. The removal or
destruction of any smoke detector by any person, except an owner for the purpose of immediate
replacement, is strictly forbidden.
§ 59-14. Certification required at change of occupancy.
At every change of occupancy of every residential occupancy unit occasioned by or incidental to a
sale, lease or sublease of said unit, it shall be the duty of the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor or
sublessor, as the case may be) to certify, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke
detectors, as required by this article or other applicable laws, are installed and in proper working
condition.

Art. I, Compliance with Flood Insurance Program, adopted 8-29-1972 by Res. No. 210, approved 8-29-
1972, and Art. II, Building Permits and Subdivision Review, adopted 8-29-1972 by Res. No. 211,
approved 8-29-1972.
Article I. Statutory Authorization
§ 62-1.01. Authority.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood
Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
floodplain management regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Borough Council of Lititz does hereby order as follows.
Article II. General Provisions
§ 62-2.01. Intent.
This chapter is intended to be a supplement to the general provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of
the Borough adopted April 27, 2010.
The provisions of the chapter are to be read and interpreted, where possible, in a fashion
consistent with the provisions of the Borough's Zoning Ordinance and in particular with regard to
Section 215 of the Zoning Ordinance. To the extent the provisions cannot be interpreted in a
consistent fashion, the provisions of this chapter shall be controlling regarding floodplain issues. It
is not the intent of this chapter to supersede or repeal any of the regulations or provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance.
This chapter has been enacted pursuant to Pennsylvania Act 166, the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act, and the rules and regulations of Section 60.3(d) of the National Flood Insurance
Program, as administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As such, the
provisions contained herein are intended to be in compliance with those regulations as they exist
on the date of this enactment.
The intent of this chapter is to:
Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
flood damage in the future.
Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its
residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
§ 62-2.02. Applicability.

It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Borough unless a permit has
been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures.
§ 62-2.03. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that
those provisions are more restrictive.
§ 62-2.04. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter shall be declared
invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of the
chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter
are hereby declared to be severable.
§ 62-2.05. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding
or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough or any officer or employee thereof
for any Flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
Article III. Administration
§ 62-3.01. Designation of Floodplain Administrator.

referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain Administrator may: (A) fulfill the
duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations, (B) delegate duties and responsibilities
set forth in these regulations to qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and
other employees, or (C) enter into a written agreement or written contract with another agency or
private sector entity to administer specific provisions of these regulations. Administration of any
part of these regulations by another entity shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities
pursuant to the participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in
the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 59.22.
In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator duties are to
be fulfilled by the Borough Manager.

proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of this and all other
applicable codes and ordinances.

In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator
shall review the history of repairs to the subject building, so that any repetitive loss concerns can
be addressed before the permit is issued.
During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized official shall
inspect the premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the information
provided on the permit application and with all applicable municipal laws and ordinances. He/she
shall make as many inspections during and upon completion of the work as are necessary.
In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall have the authority to enter
any building, structure, premises or development in the identified floodplain area, upon
presentation of proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of this
chapter.
In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not comply with the permit
application or any applicable laws and ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the permit and
report such fact to the Borough Council for whatever action it considers necessary.
The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain in perpetuity all records associated with the
requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to, finished construction elevation data,
permitting, inspection and enforcement.
The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for submitting a biennial report to FEMA
concerning community participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments of the Floodplain
Administrator can be delegated from the person identified. However, the ultimate responsibility lies
with the person identified in this chapter as the Floodplain Administrator/manager.
The Floodplain Administrator shall consider the requirements of 34 Pa. Code and the 2009 IBC
and the 2009 IRC or the latest edition thereof adopted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Floodplain Administrator. The issuance of permit does not refer to zoning approval.
The actual "start of construction" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the applicant, who sets
forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request
and the original permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the
extension is granted.

The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Borough, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated April 5, 2016, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the
Flood Insurance Study.
The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments, are
hereby adopted by the Borough and declared to be a part of this chapter.
§ 62-4.02. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway and which
represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway
has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed, unless the
appropriate permit is obtained from the DEP Regional Office.
The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on the FIRM included
in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided but no
floodway has been determined.
No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within any
AE Area/District without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development would not, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE.
No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured 50 feet
landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the DEP Regional Office.
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the base flood elevation
shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site.

In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the municipality.
The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones AO and AH on the FIRM
and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow
flooding where average depths are between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage
paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
§ 62-4.03. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the the Borough Council where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 62-6.01B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 62-4.04. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be
made by the Borough Planning Commission and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination
may appeal to the Borough Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 62-4.05. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to
boundary changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Article V. Permitted Uses
§ 62-5.01. Uses permitted by right.
The following uses are permitted by right in any special flood hazard area in compliance with the

§ 70-1. Findings; purpose.
Residences and commercial and industrial establishments located within the Borough are entitled
to clean air and environmental conditions free of unreasonable dust, obnoxious odors and smoke,
as well as an environment free from the storage and use of combustible fuels in adjacent or
exposed exterior areas within densely populated areas.
Research conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including a
project summary dated February 1998 and titled "Emissions from Outdoor Wood-Burning
Residential Hot Water Furnaces" suggests that such devices cause air emission problems that
can impact residents, neighbors, business owners, workers and visitors. In addition, according to
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), these devices produce a large
amount of smoke and this smoke can cause health problems for humans.
This chapter is intended to promote the public health, safety and welfare and to safeguard the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Borough of Lititz pursuant to the authority vested in
the Borough under Section 46202(6) of the Borough Code, 53 P.S. § 46202(6), among other
applicable laws by regulating a source of air pollution arising from the use of hydronic heaters, as
hereinafter defined.

The purpose of this article and the policy of the Borough of Lititz shall be to protect and promote the

units, and penalties. In considering the adoption of this article, the Borough makes the following
findings:

of the EMS responders and general safety of the occupants.

such used for the accountability and safety of the occupants and owner/manager.
Borough records indicate there are a greater number of disturbances at residential rental units

Borough at its sole discretion, upon affirmative showing, by the person requesting the same,
that such deviation will not be harmful to the sewerage system or the sewage treatment
plant or cause the plant effluent to violate its current NPDES discharge limitations. For the
purpose of this chapter, an allowable deviation may be granted by the Borough, provided
that the corresponding total loading allocated for each objectionable substance does not
exceed the maximum allowable industrial loading limit. Deviations granted by the Borough
shall be incorporated in the industrial user's discharge permit. In no event shall a deviation
allow a discharge to occur that is below the federal pH standard of 5.0 s.u.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or proposed to be discharged, to the sewerage system,
which waters or wastes contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated and
prohibited in this chapter or which, in the judgment of the Borough, may have a deleterious effect
upon the sewerage system or receiving waters, the Borough may, upon giving official notice to the
discharger:
Reject the waste.
Require pretreatment to reduce characteristics to daily maximum allowable concentrations
permitted by this chapter or any other applicable rules or law.
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
Require immediate discontinuance of the waste discharge until such time as it meets the
requirements of this chapter.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors or traps shall be provided where, in the opinion of the approving
authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity acceptable to the Borough and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Users having such devices shall submit annual
reports to the Borough that include receipts, manifests, bills and other proof that these devices are
in place and have been properly maintained.
The use of mechanical garbage grinders producing a finely divided mass, properly flushed with an
ample amount of water, shall be permitted upon the condition that no such mechanical garbage
grinder to serve premises used for commercial purposes shall be installed until permission for
such installation shall have been obtained from the Borough.
Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall
be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at the owner's
expense and shall be accessible to the Borough for inspection and testing.
§ 100-4.2. Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
[Added 8-6-2013 by Ord. No. C-527, approved 8-6-2013]
Upon the promulgation of the categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial
subcategory, the general standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter
for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
chapter. The Borough shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under
40 CFR 403.12. The categorical standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-
471, are incorporated herein by reference.
Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Where the Borough's sewage
treatment plant achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal categorical standards,
the Borough may apply to the regulatory authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
categorical standards.

§ 100-4.4. Authority's right to revision.
[Added 8-6-2013 by Ord. No. C-527, approved 8-6-2013]
The Borough reserves the right to establish more-stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to
the sewerage system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in § 100-4.1 of this
chapter. Nothing in these rules and regulations shall be deemed to create any vested right in any user
to a particular level, amount, concentration, characteristic or type of discharge.
§ 100-4.5. Excessive discharge.
[Added 8-6-2013 by Ord. No. C-527, approved 8-6-2013]
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation developed by the Borough or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
§ 100-4.6. Accidental discharges and slugs.
[Added 8-6-2013 by Ord. No. C-527, approved 8-6-2013]
Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
substances regulated by this Borough and from slugs. Facilities to prevent slugs or accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own
cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Borough for review and shall be approved by the Borough
before construction of the facility. No user who commences contribution to the sewerage system
after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the sewerage
system until slug and accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the Borough.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In
the case of an accidental discharge or slug discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to
immediately telephone and notify the Borough of the incident. The notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill prevention and/or slug control plan
shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following:
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
Description of stored chemicals;
Procedures for immediately notifying the Borough of any accidental or slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under § 100-4.1, with procedures for
follow-up written notification within five days;

§ 100-15. House drains.
When separate drains not necessary. The entire drainage system of every house or building shall
be separately and independently connected with the street sewer where such sewer exists, that
where one building exists or is erected in the rear of another or on an interior lot, of single
ownership, and no private sewer is available or can be made for the rear building through an
adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway, the house drain from the front building may be extended to
the rear building and the whole will be considered as one drain. Where it is necessary to construct
such a private sewer, such plans may be followed as may be approved by the Borough Council,
but in no case shall joint drains be laid in cellars, which joint drains are parallel with the street or
alley which the property faces.
Weights of cast-iron pipe required. House drains or soil pipes laid under or through the wall must
be plain cast-iron soil pipe of weights as set forth in the following table:

However, pipe laid under the floor may be standard cast-iron soil pipe.
Installation of pipe. Joints shall be leaded and caulked and shall be carried five feet outside the
foundation wall, All drains or soil pipes connected with the main drain shall be of plain cast-iron
soil pipe with leaded and caulked joints or of heavy wrought iron or steel pipe with gas tight screw
joints properly secured and carried five feet outside the cellar wall. No cast-iron soil pipe, drain,
waste or vent pipe shall be tarred or coated until after the inspection and approval by the
appropriate borough officials. All arrangements of soil waste pipes shall be laid by as direct a route
as possible. Changes of direction in pipes shall be made with curved pipes, and all connections
with Y- branches, both above and below the ground shall be protected from frost and readily
accessible for inspection and convenience in repairing. In each instance in which a pipe passes
through a new foundation wall, a relieving arch shall be built over it with a two-inch space above
and on either side of the pipe, or a sleeve shall be grouted into the wall and a sewer pipe laid
through the sleeve and caulked into place.
§ 100-16. Drains outside of buildings.
Alternate pipe permitted. Where the ground is of sufficient solidity for a proper foundation, it shall
be permissible to use transit pipe or cylindrical bell-and-spigot terra-cotta pipe, perfectly burned
and well-glazed over the entire inner and outside surfaces, provided that same shall be of the best
quality, free from flaws, splits or cracks, and provided that same shall be laid on a smooth bottom,
with a special groove cut in the bottom of the trench for each hub, where necessary, in order to

pipe. In any instance in which terra-cotta pipe is used, the spigot and hub ends shall be closely
connected and the space between the hub and pipe caulked with oakum, jute or hemp and
thoroughly filled with hot poured bituminous compound where trees are present, or the space
between the hub and pipe shall be caulked with oakum, jute or hemp and thoroughly filled with
cement mortar made of one part of the best American portland cement and two parts of bar sand,
thoroughly mixed dry, and with enough water added afterwards to give proper consistency. The
joints must be carefully wiped and pointed, and all mortar that may be left inside shall be removed,
and the pipe when completed shall be clean and smooth throughout.
Where alternate pipe not permitted. Transit or terra-cotta pipe must be laid not closer than five feet
to any exterior wall of a building nor in any portion of a drain passing under a driveway less than
3 1/2 feet below the surface of the driveway, not within 10 feet of any well, nor in "made" or "filled
in" ground.
Grade. Before any pipe is laid, the trench shall be evenly graded. The minimum grade shall be
one-fourth-inch fall per running foot. After the pipe is laid and the joints made, it shall remain
uncovered, and sufficient time shall be allowed for the joints to become set to allow for the
necessary inspection by the borough authorities. The house lateral sewer shall not be connected
to the borough sewer system until after inspection by the Borough Manager or his proper agent.
Backfilling. Backfilling shall be made with loose earth and carefully tamped about and over the
pipe in six-inch layers for a depth of one foot above the pipe, on top of which the coarser materials
may be backfilled and the trench brought to its original condition. The contractor or plumber is
authorized to supervise backfill up to and including one foot above the top of the pipe.
Cradle for wet areas. When the pipe is laid in wet areas, either cast-iron pipe with lead joints or
transit or terra-cotta pipe with a concrete bed and jacket shall be used. The concrete bed and
jacket shall extend below the bell of the pipe at least four inches, shall have a horizontal bearing
extending at the least three inches on each side of the bell of the pipe and shall be at least three
inches thick over the top or side of any part of the pipe. Concrete for this purpose shall be a oneto-
two-to-three mix with mineral aggregate having a maximum size of one inch.
Cradle for rock excavation. When pipe is laid in rock excavation, the trench shall be excavated
three inches deeper than the outside bell of the pipe, and this depth under the pipe and up to the
midsection of the pipe shall be of well-compacted concrete of a one-to-three-to-five mix or shall be
of fine gravel or coarse sand.
§ 100-17. Drilling and tapping not permitted.
Drilling and tapping of drain and waste pipes will not be permitted. When iron drains and waste pipes
are to be removed for a connection, the connection must be made by the insertion of a Y- branch;
provided, however, that when the connection is made in a basement on a horizontal run and is to
remain exposed, such connection may be made by the use of a Y-saddle. In either case, such
connections must be inspected and approved by the Borough Manager.
§ 100-18. Specifications for horizontal drains.
All horizontal drains within and to a distance of five feet beyond the walls of buildings shall be of cast
iron with caulked leaded joints or wrought iron with screw joints and shall be so located as to be readily
accessible for inspection. The house drain within the building shall not be less than four inches, and
the fall shall not be less than 1/4 of an inch per foot; it shall be laid in a trench cut out at a uniform
grade, or it may be constructed along the foundation walls above the cellar floor, resting on nine-inch
brick or stone piers laid in cement mortar [said piers to be not more than seven feet apart], or it may be
suspended from the floor beam by heavy iron hangers at intervals of not more than seven feet. The

use of pipe hooks, gas pipe or iron pipe driven into the walls is prohibited. Where a pipe passes under
the walls of a building, there shall be a relieving arch to prevent the pipe from being broken by settling
of the foundation. Said drain shall be provided with a fitting for cleaning purposes, the same to be
closed with a screw plug.
§ 100-19. Location of main trap.
[Amended 7-30-1963 by Ord. No. C-21, approved 7-30-1963]
Each drain must be provided with a double-extra-heavy cast-iron trap located just inside the curbline.
The trap will be equipped with a cleanout on the curb side of the trap for convenience in cleaning from
the trap to the main, the cover of which must be properly fitted and made gas- and airtight with a heavy
brass screw-cap ferrule, caulked in. The house drain must be equipped with a hand hole properly fitted
as described above, for the convenience of cleaning from the house to the main trap.
§ 100-20. Fresh-air inlet.
[Amended 7-30-1963 by Ord. No. C-21, approved 7-30-1963]

permitted except where necessary, nor, in any case, unless suitable provision is made to prevent
accumulation of rust or other obstructions. Offsets shall be made with forty-five-degree bends or similar
fittings. The use of T-Y's (sanitary T's) will be permitted on upright joints only.
§ 100-23. Exceptions.
Any person or persons desiring exception to any provisions in §§ 100-17, 100-19 or 100-20 of this
chapter will present in writing a petition to the Borough Manager for exceptions to the rulings. These
petitions will be prepared by the owner on forms provided by the borough and shall be accompanied by

The capacity-related tapping fee for the sewer system shall be $2,061.9 per EDU based on
an EDU of 237 gallons per day for the sewer system.
The connection-related tapping fee for the sewer system shall be $497.70 per EDU based on
an EDU basis of 237 gallons per day.
The total sewer tapping fee shall be $2,559.60 per EDU based on EDU value of 237 gallons
per day.
Notwithstanding any other definition of an EDU as set forth in Ord. No. C-345, or the Code of
Ordinances of Lititz Borough, for the purposes of calculating sewer tapping fees, an EDU
shall be calculated on the basis of 237 gallons per day per EDU.
Date of payment.
Tapping fees imposed hereunder shall be paid to the borough at the time a property owner
makes an application for a permit to connect to the borough's sewer system.
At the time a property owner makes an application for a permit to connect to the sewer
system, the borough shall estimate the connection fee and customer facilities fee (if any) to
be payable with respect to such connection. The estimated connection fee and customer
facility fee shall be payable at the time application is made for a connection permit. The
estimated amount held by the borough shall be applied to the borough's actual costs for
making such connection and providing and installing any customer facilities which may be
necessary for such connection. After the connection is completed, if the combined amount of
the estimated connection fee and customer facility fee was in excess of the actual cost of
such connection, the borough shall refund the excess to the property owner within 30 days
following the completion of the connection. If the combined estimated connection fee and
customer facility fee is less than the borough's actual cost for making such connection, the
borough shall bill the property owner for the additional costs, which bill shall be payable within
30 days of the date of said bill.
Annual sewer rentals and regulations.
Annual sewer rental.
Sanitary sewage. The sewer rental hereby imposed shall be an annual charge, payable
as hereinafter provided, based upon the water consumption of the property served as
shown by the meter readings. The schedule of rates to be used in determining the charge
for sewer rentals by the Borough of Lititz to users of the Borough of Lititz sewer system,
based on three months' usage, shall be as provided for in Chapter 55, Fees. Dwellings or
establishments which have sources of water supply other than the Borough of Lititz water
system will be required to provide a meter at the source of supply. This meter and its
installation must be furnished by the property owner and must be acceptable to the
borough and shall be available to borough employees for meter reading at any time. The
amount of water consumed, as shown by their meter readings, will be the basis for the
sewer rental charge.
Minimum charge. The minimum charge for each meter shall be as provided for in
Chapter 55, Fees, and shall be billed as follows: on March 10, on June 10, on September
10 and on December 10 of each year. Minimum charges for additional dwelling unit(s)
served by the same meter and billed to one account shall be appropriate multiples of this
schedule. For services outside of the borough limits, the minimum charges contained
herein shall be as provided for in Chapter 55, Fees.

Water not discharged into sewer system. Whenever a property upon which a sewer supply is
hereby imposed uses water from the borough water supply system[1] and/or from an
independent supply for industrial purposes such that the water so used is not discharged into
the sewer system, the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the sewer system
shall be excluded in determining the sewer rental of said property, provided that the quantity
of water so used and not discharged into the sewer system is measured by a device or
devices approved by the borough and installed without cost to the borough. The quantity used
to determine the sewer rental shall be computed by deducting the water not discharged into
the sewer system from the borough water meter readings; provided, however, that when, in
the opinion of the Borough Engineer, it is not practical to install measuring devices to
continuously determine the quantity of water not discharged into the sewer system, the
borough shall determine, in such manner and by such method as it may prescribe, the
percentage of metered water discharged into the sewer system, and the quantity of water
used to determine the sewer rental shall be the quantity measured by the water meter or
meters. Any dispute as to the estimated amount shall be determined by the borough after
notice of the estimate, whose decision on the matter shall be final for the current year.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 118, Water.
Measuring devices. All meters or other measuring devices installed or required to be used
under the provision of Subsection B(2) of this section shall be under the control of the
borough. The owner of the property upon which any such measuring device is installed shall
be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at
the property owner's expense, whether such repairs thereto shall be made necessary by wear
and tear or other causes.
Industrial waste. The borough reserves the right to refuse connection to the sewer system or
otherwise to compel discontinuance of use or to compel pretreatment by any industry to prevent
discharge into the sewer system of any industrial wastes deemed to be harmful to the sewer
system or to have a deleterious effect on the sewage treatment process.

§ 110-39. Imposition of tax.
General purpose resident tax. The taxing authority hereby imposes a tax for general revenue
purposes at the rate of 0.5% on earned income and net profits of individual residents of the taxing
authority.
General purpose municipal nonresident tax. The taxing authority also imposes a tax for general
revenue purposes at the rate of 1.0% on earned income and net profits derived by an individual

adopted by the TCC or by the collector. This includes any regulations, policies and procedures
adopted in the future to the maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.
§ 110-40. Exemption for individuals under age 16.
This governing body finds that:
Minors of various age groups have traditionally, and with judicial sanction, been considered as
comprising separate classes for many legislative purposes; and
Minors under the age of 16 are generally unemancipated and subject to compulsory school
attendance and child labor laws, and therefore have limited earned income and net profits
and control of money such that enforcement of reporting and collection of tax hereunder
against them would yield inconsequential amounts and be unduly difficult, expensive, and not
in the public interest.
For these reasons, individuals under the age of 16 years are exempt from liability for the tax.
§ 110-41. Exemption for residents of other states if similar
exemption in other state.
Individuals who are residents of a state other than Pennsylvania are exempt from liability for the
tax, but only if all local governments of the locality where the individual resides either:
Impose no tax on the income of a Pennsylvania resident derived from activities within the
locality; or
Exempt that income from tax.
In addition to this exemption from municipal nonresident tax, certain credits and deductions
against tax are permitted under certain circumstances as provided in applicable law and
regulations.
§ 110-42. Individual tax returns and payments.
Every individual receiving earned income or earning net profits in any tax year shall file tax returns and
pay tax in accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act.
§ 110-43. Employer withholding, remittance, and tax returns.
Every employer shall register, withhold and remit tax, and file tax returns in accordance with the Local
Tax Enabling Act.
§ 110-44. Tax collector.
The tax will be collected from individuals and employers by the collector. The Borough designates the
Lancaster County Tax Collection Bureau as its collector.
§ 110-45. Interest, penalties, costs, and fines.

provisions.
General deletions.
Sections pertaining to severability, effective dates and repeals have been deleted since such
provisions are included in this ordinance or are of no further effect.

been given chapter or Article titles as part of the Code.
Substantive changes and revisions. In addition to the changes and revisions described above, the
following changes and revisions of a substantive nature are hereby made to various ordinances
included in the Code. These changes are made to bring provisions into conformity with the desired
policies of the Council, and it is the intent of the Council that all such changes be adopted as part

average. The municipal governing body shall make a conditional appointment from the three names
certified, based solely on the merits and fitness of the candidates, unless Borough Council makes
objection to the Commission regarding one or more of the certified persons for any of the reasons
stated in § 7-24. Should the objections be sustained by the Commission, or if the conditional appointee
is determined to be unqualified in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 7-26, the Commission
shall strike the name of the person from the eligibility list and certify the next-highest name for each
name stricken from the eligibility list. As each subsequent vacancy occurs in the same or another
position, precisely the same procedure shall be followed. The number of available eligibles certified
from the eligible list shall exceed by two for each vacancy to be filled from such eligible list. If there are
fewer than three available eligibles on the eligible list, the municipal governing body may make a
selection from such lesser number of available eligibles or may request that the Commission hold
another examination.
§ 7-50. Removal of names from furlough and eligible lists.
In addition to the other reasons stated as grounds for removal in these rules, the name of any
person appearing on a furlough list or an eligible list shall be removed by the Commission if such
person:
Is appointed to a position in the Police Department; or
Declines an appointment to a permanent position in the Police Department; or
Fails to make written reply to the Commission seven calendar days from the date of mailing of
a notice of certification; or
Indicates availability for appointment and is appointed to fill a vacancy but fails to report for
duty at the time prescribed, unless, in the opinion of the municipal governing body, such
person can show good and sufficient reasons for failure to report.
The name of any person on an eligible list also shall be removed by the Commission if certified for
appointment consideration three times as the top name and he/she is not appointed. Nothing in
this section, however, shall be construed as authorizing the removal of the name of a person from
a furlough list or eligible list who refuses or accepts a position of a lower rank than that from which
furloughed or for which eligible on a Commission list.
§ 7-51. Appointment procedures.
Whenever the name of a person is certified from either the furlough list or the eligible list, the person
shall be notified immediately of such certification. The notice shall include the title of the position and
the compensation to be paid and shall request a written reply within seven days from the date of
mailing.

All initial appointments to positions in the Police Department shall be for a probationary period of one
year from the date of appointment. During the probationary period, an appointee may be dismissed
only for a cause specified in § 7-54 or because of incapacity for duty due to the use of alcohol or drugs.
The Chief of Police shall review the adjustment, performance and general acceptability of each
probationer quarterly to determine whether such probationer is fully qualified for permanent
appointment. The Chief of Police shall make a report to the municipal governing body recommending
termination of employment of a police officer found not to be acceptable in his or her position and/or
shall submit a final probationary report, not less than 10 nor more than 15 calendar days before the
next regular meeting of the municipal governing body immediately preceding the end of the
probationary period. Each final probationary report shall include the recommendation of the Chief of
Police to retain the probationer. Each report shall be submitted in writing to the municipal governing
body. Within five calendar days after receiving a probationary report from the Chief of Police
recommending retention or rejection of a probationer, the municipal governing body shall notify the
Commission, in writing, of its decision to retain or remove the probationer. The Commission, in turn,
shall notify the probationer of such decision within five calendar days and in no event beyond the last
day of the probationary period.
§ 7-53. Appointment of Chief of Police.
In the case of a vacancy in the office of Chief of Police, the municipal governing body has full
discretion in selecting the individual to fill the position of Chief of Police. If the municipal governing
body requests the Commission to subject that person to a noncompetitive examination, and if that
person successfully passes the noncompetitive examination, then the Commission shall notify the
municipal governing body of the results of the examination and that person may only be removed
from the position of Chief of Police for reasons set forth in § 7-54.
A Police Chief may be appointed by the municipal governing body without civil service status. If
the municipal governing body takes this route, the individual appointed to Police Chief may be
returned to a prior rank within the Borough of Lititz Police Department if promoted within or
dismissed from an outside appointment, without implicating civil service hearing rights.
Article IX. Suspensions, Removals and Reduction in Rank
§ 7-54. Grounds for disciplinary action.
No person appointed to a position in the Police Department pursuant to these rules and
regulations may be suspended without pay or removed and no person promoted in rank pursuant
to these rules and regulations may be reduced in rank except for the following reasons:
Physical or mental disability affecting the officer's ability to continue in service, in which case
the officer shall receive an honorable discharge from service;
Neglect or violation of an official duty;
A violation of any law which provides that such violation constitutes a misdemeanor or felony;
Inefficiency, neglect, intemperance, immorality, disobedience of orders or conduct
unbecoming an officer;
Intoxication while on duty;
Engaging or participating in or conducting any political or election campaign while on duty or
in uniform or while using Borough property, otherwise than to exercise the person's own right
of suffrage; or

Editor's Note: See 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 1104(f).
No officer shall be removed for religious, racial or political reasons.
A written statement of any charges made against any officer so employed shall be furnished to the
officer within five days after those charges have been adopted by the municipal governing body.
The person so employed shall have 10 days from the date of receiving the notice in which to
submit a written request for a hearing to the Civil Service Commission under § 7-57.
§ 7-55. Furloughs.
If, for reasons of economy or other reasons, it shall be deemed necessary by the municipal governing
body to reduce the number of full-time police officers in the Department, then the municipal governing
body shall furlough the person or persons, including probationers, last appointed to the force. Such
removal shall be accomplished by furloughing in numerical order commencing with the person last
appointed until such reduction shall have been accomplished. In the event the said police force shall
again be increased, the employees furloughed shall be reinstated in the order of their seniority in the
service. The provisions of this section as to reduction in force are not applicable to Chief of Police.
§ 7-56. Notice of suspension, removal or reduction in rank.
Whenever a police officer is suspended, removed or reduced in rank, the specific charges
warranting such action shall be stated in writing by the municipal governing body. The charges
shall be stated clearly and in sufficient detail to enable the officer to understand the charges and to
allow the officer an opportunity to respond to those charges. The charges shall specify the
subsection of § 7-54 which provides the basis for the disciplinary action as well as an explanation
of the factual circumstances upon which the municipal governing body relied in finding a violation
of § 7-54.
Within five days after the municipal governing body has voted to impose the disciplinary action, a
written statement of the charges shall be delivered to the officer either by personal service or by
certified and registered mail. In addition, the charges shall notify the officer of the right to appeal
under § 7-57 of these rules and regulations. A copy of the statement of charges shall also be
served upon the members of the Commission.
§ 7-57. Hearings on suspensions, removals and reductions in
rank.
The officer who has been suspended, removed or reduced in rank may appeal the decision of the
municipal governing body by written notice to the Secretary at 7 South Broad Street, Lititz,
Pennsylvania, 17543, requesting a hearing. This request shall be received by the Commission
within 10 days after the officer received notice of the discipline. The officer may make written
answers to any charges filed not later than the date fixed for the hearing. Failure of the officer to
provide written answers to any of the charges shall not be deemed an admission by the officer.
The Commission shall grant the officer a hearing within 10 days from the officer's written request
for a hearing, unless continued by the Commission for cause at the request of the Commission,
the municipal governing body or the officer. Notwithstanding this provision, the failure of the
Commission to hold a hearing within 10 days from the filing of the charges in writing shall not
result in the dismissal of the charges filed. The Council may suspend the person, without pay,
pending the determination of the charges against the person; but in the event the Commission

fails to uphold the charges, then the person sought to be suspended, removed or reduced in rank
shall be reinstated with full pay for the period during which the person was suspended, removed or
reduced in rank, and the charges shall be sealed and not be available for public inspection in the
event the charges are dismissed. At any such hearing, the officer against whom the charges have
been made may be present and represented by counsel, may call witnesses and may present
testimony and documentation in defense. The municipal governing body may also be represented
by counsel, call witnesses and present evidence as is necessary to support the charges. A
stenographic record of all testimony shall be taken at every hearing and preserved by the
Commission. In the event the charges are dismissed, the record shall be sealed and not be
available for public inspection. Notice of the date, time and place for each hearing shall be given in
the following manner:
Either by personal service or certified or registered mail to each of the principals involved in
the case; and
By regular, first-class mail to all other persons who have stated an interest in the hearing;
provided, however, that any failure to give the notice required by this subsection shall not
invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Commission.
In conducting the hearing, the Commission's standard of review shall be to determine whether
sufficient evidence has been presented to support the statutory reason for the disciplinary action.
If the Commission finds that sufficient evidence has been introduced to support the charge, the
Commission shall not modify the penalty imposed by the municipal governing body unless it finds
that the penalty imposed was arbitrary, discriminatory or an abuse of the municipal governing
body's discretion. In considering the appropriateness of the discipline, the Commission shall not
substitute its judgment for that of the municipal governing body. The Commission may request
post-hearing briefs and shall issue a written decision containing specific findings of fact and
conclusions of law within 60 days of receipt of the hearing transcript.
Unless the municipal governing body or the person sought to be suspended, removed, or reduced
in rank requests that the proceedings before the Commission be open to the public, the
proceedings before the Commission pursuant to this section shall be held in the nature of a closed
executive session that shall not be open to the public. Any such request shall be presented to the
Commission before the civil service hearing commences. The deliberations of the Commission,
including interim rulings on evidentiary or procedural issues, may be held in private and shall not
be subject to request for being open to the public, the municipal governing body or to the person
sought to be suspended, removed, or reduced in rank. The Commission's disposition of the
disciplinary action shall constitute official action which shall occur at a public meeting held
pursuant to 65 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 7 (relating to open meetings). All parties concerned shall have
immediate right of appeal to the court of common pleas of the county, and the case shall there be
determined as the court deems proper. No order of suspension made by the Commission shall be
for a longer period than one year. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days from the date of entry
by the Commission of its final order and shall be by petition.
§ 7-58. Hearing procedure.
All testimony shall be given under oath administered by the Chairperson, or in the absence of the
Chairperson, the Vice Chairperson of the Commission. The Commission shall have the power to
issue subpoenas as set forth in § 7-14 hereof. The hearing shall be open to the public unless, prior
to the commencement of the hearing, a written or oral request to close the hearing is made by
either the charged officer or the municipal governing body.
Each hearing shall be conducted in substantially the same format as follows:
The Chairman shall state the general purpose of the hearing;

rank may file an appeal with the Court of Common Pleas within 60 days of the date of entry by the
Commission of its final order. No order of suspension shall be made by the Commission for a
period longer than one year. In the event that the Commission fails to uphold the charges, then the
person sought to be suspended, removed or demoted shall be reinstated with full pay for the
period of suspension, removal or demotion, and no charges related to the suspension, removal or
reduction in rank shall be officially recorded in the officer's record.

ordinances separate and distinct from the Borough of Lititz Construction Code.
§ 36-3. Adoption of standards.
The Borough hereby adopts the standards which the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry
has made part of the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code identified in § 403.21 of the Labor and
Industry Regulations as the Borough of Lititz Construction Code with the following additions to the
International Building Code/2003:
Labor and Industry Regulations amendments.

amended to incorporate the provisions of the Borough Building Code in existence as of May
11, 1998, and is amended to include the following regulations:
Private garage fire separation. Private garages shall be separated from the dwelling by

§ 59-10. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
RESIDENTIAL OCCUPANCY
The occupancy or use of a building or structure or any portion thereof by persons for whom
sleeping accommodations are provided, including but not limited to one- and two-family dwellings,
lodging or rooming houses, dormitories, apartment buildings, hotels and single-family attached
and detached dwellings.
§ 59-11. Requirements.
It shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new and existing occupied residential occupancy unit
to install smoke detectors in each such residential occupancy unit as hereinafter provided. Said smoke
detectors shall be capable of sensing visible and invisible particles of combustion and providing a

suitable audible alarm thereof; further, they shall be installed by 150 days after adoption of this article
in the manner hereinafter provided. Failure to install smoke detectors as and where required by said
date will subject the property owner to the penalties set forth in § 59-9 of the Code of the Borough of
Lititz, Pennsylvania.
§ 59-12. Location.
At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each sleeping area. A "sleeping area" is
defined as the area or areas of the residential occupancy unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping
rooms) are located. Where bedrooms or rooms habitually used for sleeping are separated by other
use areas (such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purpose of this section.
At least one smoke detector shall be installed at the head (top) of each stairway leading up to an
occupied area.
§ 59-13. Installation; maintenance; removal or destruction.
In new residential occupancy units, smoke detectors shall be wired directly (hard wired) to the
building's electrical system. In all existing residential occupancy units, it is preferred that the
smoke detectors be wired directly (hard wired) to the building's electrical system; however, a
monitored battery-powered unit is acceptable.
It shall be the responsibility of the homeowner(s) and landlord(s) and tenant(s) to maintain smoke
detectors. Such maintenance shall include keeping smoke detectors serviceable by replacing
batteries when necessary or by keeping them connected to an electrical source so that they
remain capable of transmitting an audible signal in the presence of smoke. The removal or
destruction of any smoke detector by any person, except an owner for the purpose of immediate
replacement, is strictly forbidden.
§ 59-14. Certification required at change of occupancy.
At every change of occupancy of every residential occupancy unit occasioned by or incidental to a
sale, lease or sublease of said unit, it shall be the duty of the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor or
sublessor, as the case may be) to certify, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke
detectors, as required by this article or other applicable laws, are installed and in proper working
condition.

Art. I, Compliance with Flood Insurance Program, adopted 8-29-1972 by Res. No. 210, approved 8-29-
1972, and Art. II, Building Permits and Subdivision Review, adopted 8-29-1972 by Res. No. 211,

Article I. Statutory Authorization
§ 62-1.01. Authority.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood
Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
floodplain management regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Borough Council of Lititz does hereby order as follows.
Article II. General Provisions
§ 62-2.01. Intent.
This chapter is intended to be a supplement to the general provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of
the Borough adopted April 27, 2010.
The provisions of the chapter are to be read and interpreted, where possible, in a fashion
consistent with the provisions of the Borough's Zoning Ordinance and in particular with regard to
Section 215 of the Zoning Ordinance. To the extent the provisions cannot be interpreted in a
consistent fashion, the provisions of this chapter shall be controlling regarding floodplain issues. It
is not the intent of this chapter to supersede or repeal any of the regulations or provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance.
This chapter has been enacted pursuant to Pennsylvania Act 166, the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act, and the rules and regulations of Section 60.3(d) of the National Flood Insurance
Program, as administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As such, the
provisions contained herein are intended to be in compliance with those regulations as they exist
on the date of this enactment.
The intent of this chapter is to:
Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
flood damage in the future.
Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its
residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
§ 62-2.02. Applicability.

It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Borough unless a permit has
been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures.
§ 62-2.03. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that
those provisions are more restrictive.
§ 62-2.04. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter shall be declared
invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of the
chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter
are hereby declared to be severable.
§ 62-2.05. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding
or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough or any officer or employee thereof
for any Flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
Article III. Administration
§ 62-3.01. Designation of Floodplain Administrator.
The Codes Compliance Officer is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this chapter and is
referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain Administrator may: (A) fulfill the
duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations, (B) delegate duties and responsibilities
set forth in these regulations to qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and
other employees, or (C) enter into a written agreement or written contract with another agency or
private sector entity to administer specific provisions of these regulations. Administration of any
part of these regulations by another entity shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities
pursuant to the participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in
the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 59.22.
In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator duties are to
be fulfilled by the Borough Manager.

A permit shall be required before any construction or development is undertaken within any area of the
Borough.
§ 62-3.03. Duties and responsibilities of Floodplain Administrator.
The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit only after it has been determined that the
proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of this and all other
applicable codes and ordinances.
Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the application for the
permit to determine if all other necessary government permits required by state and federal laws
have been obtained, such as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act 1966-
537, as amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended);[1] and the U.S.
Clean Water Act, Section 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. No permit shall be issued until this determination
has been made.
Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 750.1 et seq., 32 P.S. § 693.1 et seq., and 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.,
respectively.
In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator
shall review the history of repairs to the subject building, so that any repetitive loss concerns can
be addressed before the permit is issued.
During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized official shall
inspect the premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the information
provided on the permit application and with all applicable municipal laws and ordinances. He/she
shall make as many inspections during and upon completion of the work as are necessary.
In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall have the authority to enter
any building, structure, premises or development in the identified floodplain area, upon
presentation of proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of this
chapter.
In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not comply with the permit
application or any applicable laws and ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the permit and
report such fact to the Borough Council for whatever action it considers necessary.
The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain in perpetuity all records associated with the
requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to, finished construction elevation data,
permitting, inspection and enforcement.
The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for submitting a biennial report to FEMA
concerning community participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments of the Floodplain
Administrator can be delegated from the person identified. However, the ultimate responsibility lies

§ 62-3.06. Review of application by others.
A copy of all plans and applications for any proposed construction or development in any identified
floodplain area to be considered for approval may be submitted by the Floodplain Administrator to any
other appropriate agencies and/or individuals (e.g., planning commission, municipal engineer, etc.) for
review and comment.
§ 62-3.07. Changes.
After the issuance of a permit by the Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made to
the application, permit or any of the plans, specifications or other documents submitted with the
application without the written consent or approval of the Floodplain Administrator. Requests for any
such change shall be in writing, and shall be submitted by the applicant to Floodplain Administrator for
consideration.

The actual "start of construction" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the applicant, who sets
forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request
and the original permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the
extension is granted.

The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Borough, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated April 5, 2016, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the
Flood Insurance Study.
The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments, are
hereby adopted by the Borough and declared to be a part of this chapter.
§ 62-4.02. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway and which
represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway
has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed, unless the
appropriate permit is obtained from the DEP Regional Office.
The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on the FIRM included
in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided but no
floodway has been determined.
No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within any
AE Area/District without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development would not, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE.
No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured 50 feet
landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the DEP Regional Office.
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the base flood elevation
shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site.

In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the municipality.
The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones AO and AH on the FIRM
and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow
flooding where average depths are between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage
paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
§ 62-4.03. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the the Borough Council where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 62-6.01B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 62-4.04. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be
made by the Borough Planning Commission and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination
may appeal to the Borough Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 62-4.05. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to
boundary changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Article V. Permitted Uses
§ 62-5.01. Uses permitted by right.
The following uses are permitted by right in any special flood hazard area in compliance with the
requirements of this article:

START OF CONSTRUCTION
Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the

addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of the permit and
shall be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of the permit unless a time

footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not

lease of land for agricultural purposes into parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new
street or easement of access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.

before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost
equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage or repetitive
loss regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any
project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and
which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

Open burning  See Ch. 38.
§ 70-1. Findings; purpose.
Residences and commercial and industrial establishments located within the Borough are entitled
to clean air and environmental conditions free of unreasonable dust, obnoxious odors and smoke,
as well as an environment free from the storage and use of combustible fuels in adjacent or
exposed exterior areas within densely populated areas.
Research conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including a
project summary dated February 1998 and titled "Emissions from Outdoor Wood-Burning
Residential Hot Water Furnaces" suggests that such devices cause air emission problems that
can impact residents, neighbors, business owners, workers and visitors. In addition, according to
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), these devices produce a large
amount of smoke and this smoke can cause health problems for humans.
This chapter is intended to promote the public health, safety and welfare and to safeguard the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Borough of Lititz pursuant to the authority vested in
the Borough under Section 46202(6) of the Borough Code, 53 P.S. § 46202(6), among other
applicable laws by regulating a source of air pollution arising from the use of hydronic heaters, as
hereinafter defined.

have violated a PUC regulation, standard, or order, then the Borough may bring a complaint
against such telecommunications provider before the Public Utility Commission for violation of
such regulation, standard, or order. The Borough may also notify the telecommunications provider
of the existence of any suspected violation of PUC standards, regulations or order in order to
obtain compliance by the telecommunications provider.
In the event a telecommunications provider is found to have violated any other provision of this
chapter that is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the PUC, then such telecommunications
provider shall be subject, upon conviction thereof, to a fine not exceeding $300, for each and
every offense, together with attorneys' fees and costs, and in default of the payment thereof,
imprisonment for not more than 90 days. A separate and distinct violation shall be deemed to be
committed each day on which a violation occurs or continues to occur. In addition to an action to
enforce any penalty imposed by this chapter and any other remedy at law or in equity under this
chapter, the Borough may apply to a Court of Common Pleas for an injunction or other appropriate
relief at law or in equity to enforce compliance with or restrain violation of any provision of this
chapter which is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the PUC.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Borough to commence or attempt to
commence prosecution of any PUC regulated telecommunications provider for a violation of any
regulation, standard or order of the PUC.
Non-PUC regulated entities. Any entity not regulated by the PUC that is found by the Borough to
have violated any provision of this chapter shall be subject, upon conviction thereof, to a fine not
exceeding $300, for each and every offense, together with attorneys' fees and costs, and in
default of the payment thereof, imprisonment for not more than 90 days. A separate and distinct

this chapter or right-of-way use permit, such telecommunications provider shall be provided written
notice of the determination and the reasons therefor. Except in the case of an emergency, the
telecommunications provider shall have 30 days to cure the violation. If the nature of the violation is
such that it cannot be fully cured within such time period, the Borough may, in its reasonable judgment,
extend the time period to cure provided the telecommunications provider has commenced to cure and

of transacting and carrying on a business within the Borough; or any permit or agreement for
occupying any other property of the Borough.
§ 96-5.6. No waiver.
The failure of the Borough to insist on timely performance or compliance by any Permitee holding a
right-of-way use authorization shall not constitute a waiver of the Borough's right to later insist on

other occasion, nor shall the failure to enforce any prior ordinance or Borough Charter provision
affecting the right-of-way, any facilities, or any user or occupant of the right-of-way act as a waiver or

Borough at its sole discretion, upon affirmative showing, by the person requesting the same,
that such deviation will not be harmful to the sewerage system or the sewage treatment
plant or cause the plant effluent to violate its current NPDES discharge limitations. For the
purpose of this chapter, an allowable deviation may be granted by the Borough, provided
that the corresponding total loading allocated for each objectionable substance does not
exceed the maximum allowable industrial loading limit. Deviations granted by the Borough
shall be incorporated in the industrial user's discharge permit. In no event shall a deviation
allow a discharge to occur that is below the federal pH standard of 5.0 s.u.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or proposed to be discharged, to the sewerage system,
which waters or wastes contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated and
prohibited in this chapter or which, in the judgment of the Borough, may have a deleterious effect
upon the sewerage system or receiving waters, the Borough may, upon giving official notice to the
discharger:
Reject the waste.
Require pretreatment to reduce characteristics to daily maximum allowable concentrations
permitted by this chapter or any other applicable rules or law.
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
Require immediate discontinuance of the waste discharge until such time as it meets the
requirements of this chapter.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors or traps shall be provided where, in the opinion of the approving
authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity acceptable to the Borough and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Users having such devices shall submit annual
reports to the Borough that include receipts, manifests, bills and other proof that these devices are
in place and have been properly maintained.
The use of mechanical garbage grinders producing a finely divided mass, properly flushed with an
ample amount of water, shall be permitted upon the condition that no such mechanical garbage
grinder to serve premises used for commercial purposes shall be installed until permission for
such installation shall have been obtained from the Borough.
Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall
be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at the owner's
expense and shall be accessible to the Borough for inspection and testing.
§ 100-4.2. Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
[Added 8-6-2013 by Ord. No. C-527, approved 8-6-2013]
Upon the promulgation of the categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial
subcategory, the general standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter
for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
chapter. The Borough shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under
40 CFR 403.12. The categorical standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-
471, are incorporated herein by reference.
Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Where the Borough's sewage
treatment plant achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal categorical standards,
the Borough may apply to the regulatory authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
categorical standards.

the owner or his agent.
§ 100-15. House drains.
When separate drains not necessary. The entire drainage system of every house or building shall
be separately and independently connected with the street sewer where such sewer exists, that
where one building exists or is erected in the rear of another or on an interior lot, of single
ownership, and no private sewer is available or can be made for the rear building through an
adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway, the house drain from the front building may be extended to
the rear building and the whole will be considered as one drain. Where it is necessary to construct
such a private sewer, such plans may be followed as may be approved by the Borough Council,
but in no case shall joint drains be laid in cellars, which joint drains are parallel with the street or
alley which the property faces.
Weights of cast-iron pipe required. House drains or soil pipes laid under or through the wall must
be plain cast-iron soil pipe of weights as set forth in the following table:
Pipe Size

However, pipe laid under the floor may be standard cast-iron soil pipe.
Installation of pipe. Joints shall be leaded and caulked and shall be carried five feet outside the
foundation wall, All drains or soil pipes connected with the main drain shall be of plain cast-iron
soil pipe with leaded and caulked joints or of heavy wrought iron or steel pipe with gas tight screw
joints properly secured and carried five feet outside the cellar wall. No cast-iron soil pipe, drain,
waste or vent pipe shall be tarred or coated until after the inspection and approval by the
appropriate borough officials. All arrangements of soil waste pipes shall be laid by as direct a route
as possible. Changes of direction in pipes shall be made with curved pipes, and all connections
with Y- branches, both above and below the ground shall be protected from frost and readily
accessible for inspection and convenience in repairing. In each instance in which a pipe passes
through a new foundation wall, a relieving arch shall be built over it with a two-inch space above
and on either side of the pipe, or a sleeve shall be grouted into the wall and a sewer pipe laid
through the sleeve and caulked into place.
§ 100-16. Drains outside of buildings.
Alternate pipe permitted. Where the ground is of sufficient solidity for a proper foundation, it shall
be permissible to use transit pipe or cylindrical bell-and-spigot terra-cotta pipe, perfectly burned
and well-glazed over the entire inner and outside surfaces, provided that same shall be of the best
quality, free from flaws, splits or cracks, and provided that same shall be laid on a smooth bottom,
with a special groove cut in the bottom of the trench for each hub, where necessary, in order to

give the pipe a solid bearing on its entire length, and the soil well-rammed on each side of the
pipe. In any instance in which terra-cotta pipe is used, the spigot and hub ends shall be closely
connected and the space between the hub and pipe caulked with oakum, jute or hemp and
thoroughly filled with hot poured bituminous compound where trees are present, or the space
between the hub and pipe shall be caulked with oakum, jute or hemp and thoroughly filled with
cement mortar made of one part of the best American portland cement and two parts of bar sand,
thoroughly mixed dry, and with enough water added afterwards to give proper consistency. The
joints must be carefully wiped and pointed, and all mortar that may be left inside shall be removed,
and the pipe when completed shall be clean and smooth throughout.
Where alternate pipe not permitted. Transit or terra-cotta pipe must be laid not closer than five feet
to any exterior wall of a building nor in any portion of a drain passing under a driveway less than
3 1/2 feet below the surface of the driveway, not within 10 feet of any well, nor in "made" or "filled
in" ground.
Grade. Before any pipe is laid, the trench shall be evenly graded. The minimum grade shall be
one-fourth-inch fall per running foot. After the pipe is laid and the joints made, it shall remain
uncovered, and sufficient time shall be allowed for the joints to become set to allow for the
necessary inspection by the borough authorities. The house lateral sewer shall not be connected
to the borough sewer system until after inspection by the Borough Manager or his proper agent.
Backfilling. Backfilling shall be made with loose earth and carefully tamped about and over the
pipe in six-inch layers for a depth of one foot above the pipe, on top of which the coarser materials
may be backfilled and the trench brought to its original condition. The contractor or plumber is
authorized to supervise backfill up to and including one foot above the top of the pipe.
Cradle for wet areas. When the pipe is laid in wet areas, either cast-iron pipe with lead joints or
transit or terra-cotta pipe with a concrete bed and jacket shall be used. The concrete bed and
jacket shall extend below the bell of the pipe at least four inches, shall have a horizontal bearing
extending at the least three inches on each side of the bell of the pipe and shall be at least three
inches thick over the top or side of any part of the pipe. Concrete for this purpose shall be a oneto-
two-to-three mix with mineral aggregate having a maximum size of one inch.
Cradle for rock excavation. When pipe is laid in rock excavation, the trench shall be excavated
three inches deeper than the outside bell of the pipe, and this depth under the pipe and up to the
midsection of the pipe shall be of well-compacted concrete of a one-to-three-to-five mix or shall be
of fine gravel or coarse sand.
§ 100-17. Drilling and tapping not permitted.
Drilling and tapping of drain and waste pipes will not be permitted. When iron drains and waste pipes
are to be removed for a connection, the connection must be made by the insertion of a Y- branch;
provided, however, that when the connection is made in a basement on a horizontal run and is to
remain exposed, such connection may be made by the use of a Y-saddle. In either case, such
connections must be inspected and approved by the Borough Manager.
§ 100-18. Specifications for horizontal drains.
All horizontal drains within and to a distance of five feet beyond the walls of buildings shall be of cast
iron with caulked leaded joints or wrought iron with screw joints and shall be so located as to be readily
accessible for inspection. The house drain within the building shall not be less than four inches, and
the fall shall not be less than 1/4 of an inch per foot; it shall be laid in a trench cut out at a uniform
grade, or it may be constructed along the foundation walls above the cellar floor, resting on nine-inch
brick or stone piers laid in cement mortar [said piers to be not more than seven feet apart], or it may be
suspended from the floor beam by heavy iron hangers at intervals of not more than seven feet. The

Date of payment.
Tapping fees imposed hereunder shall be paid to the borough at the time a property owner

necessary for such connection. After the connection is completed, if the combined amount of
the estimated connection fee and customer facility fee was in excess of the actual cost of
such connection, the borough shall refund the excess to the property owner within 30 days
following the completion of the connection. If the combined estimated connection fee and
customer facility fee is less than the borough's actual cost for making such connection, the
borough shall bill the property owner for the additional costs, which bill shall be payable within
30 days of the date of said bill.
Annual sewer rentals and regulations.
Annual sewer rental.

shown by the meter readings. The schedule of rates to be used in determining the charge
for sewer rentals by the Borough of Lititz to users of the Borough of Lititz sewer system,
based on three months' usage, shall be as provided for in Chapter 55, Fees. Dwellings or
establishments which have sources of water supply other than the Borough of Lititz water
system will be required to provide a meter at the source of supply. This meter and its
installation must be furnished by the property owner and must be acceptable to the
borough and shall be available to borough employees for meter reading at any time. The
amount of water consumed, as shown by their meter readings, will be the basis for the
sewer rental charge.

Water not discharged into sewer system. Whenever a property upon which a sewer supply is
hereby imposed uses water from the borough water supply system[1] and/or from an
independent supply for industrial purposes such that the water so used is not discharged into
the sewer system, the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the sewer system
shall be excluded in determining the sewer rental of said property, provided that the quantity
of water so used and not discharged into the sewer system is measured by a device or
devices approved by the borough and installed without cost to the borough. The quantity used
to determine the sewer rental shall be computed by deducting the water not discharged into
the sewer system from the borough water meter readings; provided, however, that when, in
the opinion of the Borough Engineer, it is not practical to install measuring devices to
continuously determine the quantity of water not discharged into the sewer system, the
borough shall determine, in such manner and by such method as it may prescribe, the
percentage of metered water discharged into the sewer system, and the quantity of water
used to determine the sewer rental shall be the quantity measured by the water meter or
meters. Any dispute as to the estimated amount shall be determined by the borough after
notice of the estimate, whose decision on the matter shall be final for the current year.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 118, Water.
Measuring devices. All meters or other measuring devices installed or required to be used
under the provision of Subsection B(2) of this section shall be under the control of the
borough. The owner of the property upon which any such measuring device is installed shall
be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at
the property owner's expense, whether such repairs thereto shall be made necessary by wear
and tear or other causes.
Industrial waste. The borough reserves the right to refuse connection to the sewer system or
otherwise to compel discontinuance of use or to compel pretreatment by any industry to prevent
discharge into the sewer system of any industrial wastes deemed to be harmful to the sewer
system or to have a deleterious effect on the sewage treatment process.
§ 100-26. Time and method of payment
[Amended 5-29-1984 by Ord. No. C-279-2, approved 5-29-1984]
All connection charges shall be due and payable at the time of making connection. The annual sewer
rentals shall commence when the sewer system becomes available for use by the particular improved
property and thereafter shall be due and payable at the same time and by the same method that water

same times and in the same manner as the charges for water.

§ 110-18.3. Applicability; validity.
Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the Borough to levy and collect the

Constitution of the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be held to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as to any
individual, such decision shall not affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax, or the
validity of the tax so imposed, on other persons or individuals as herein provided.
It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed on an occupation by the
Borough and the Warwick School District (if said School District shall impose any such tax) shall
not exceed the limitations prescribed in Sections 2 and 8 of The Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S.
§§ 6902 and 6908,[1] and therefore the School District shall be entitled to its share of the tax (if
any) in accordance with the provisions of said Sections 2 and 8, Act 222 of 2004, and Act 7 of
2007.

purposes at the rate of 0.5% on earned income and net profits of individual residents of the taxing
authority.
General purpose municipal nonresident tax. The taxing authority also imposes a tax for general

adopted by the TCC or by the collector. This includes any regulations, policies and procedures
adopted in the future to the maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.
§ 110-40. Exemption for individuals under age 16.
This governing body finds that:
Minors of various age groups have traditionally, and with judicial sanction, been considered as
comprising separate classes for many legislative purposes; and
Minors under the age of 16 are generally unemancipated and subject to compulsory school
attendance and child labor laws, and therefore have limited earned income and net profits
and control of money such that enforcement of reporting and collection of tax hereunder
against them would yield inconsequential amounts and be unduly difficult, expensive, and not
in the public interest.
For these reasons, individuals under the age of 16 years are exempt from liability for the tax.
§ 110-41. Exemption for residents of other states if similar
exemption in other state.
Individuals who are residents of a state other than Pennsylvania are exempt from liability for the
tax, but only if all local governments of the locality where the individual resides either:
Impose no tax on the income of a Pennsylvania resident derived from activities within the
locality; or
Exempt that income from tax.
In addition to this exemption from municipal nonresident tax, certain credits and deductions
against tax are permitted under certain circumstances as provided in applicable law and
regulations.
§ 110-42. Individual tax returns and payments.
Every individual receiving earned income or earning net profits in any tax year shall file tax returns and
pay tax in accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act.
§ 110-43. Employer withholding, remittance, and tax returns.
Every employer shall register, withhold and remit tax, and file tax returns in accordance with the Local
Tax Enabling Act.
§ 110-44. Tax collector.
The tax will be collected from individuals and employers by the collector. The Borough designates the
Lancaster County Tax Collection Bureau as its collector.
§ 110-45. Interest, penalties, costs, and fines.

SECTION 215. Floodplain District.
Ordinance C-544, adopted by Borough Council on March 29, 2016, established a standalone Flood Plain ordinance. Article II, Section 2.01.B of C-544 states that this ordinance and the Zoning Ordinance are to be consistent. When provisions of the two ordinances cannot be interpreted in a consistent fashion, the provisions of C-544 shall be controlling regarding floodplain issues.
A. Purpose.
1. The Floodplain District shall include the areas of the Borough of Lititz which are subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters. This inundation results in loss of life and property; health and safety hazards; disruption of commerce and governmental services; extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief; impairment of the tax base; and other adverse effects on the public health, safety and general welfare.
2. In the interest of public health, safety and welfare, the regulations of the Floodplain District are designed and intended to protect floodplains subject to and necessary for floodwaters, to permit and encourage the retention of open land uses so located and utilized and to guide incompatible development into more appropriate zoning districts.
3. In advancing these principles and the general purposes of this Zoning Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan, and as a supplement to Section 101 of this Ordinance, the specific intent of these regulations include the following:
a. Regulating uses, activities and development, which, acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, activities and development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities, and frequencies.
b. Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development from locating within areas subject to flooding.
c. Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding and flood damage.
Lititz Borough Zoning Ordinance Page 72
§ 215. § 215.
d. Informing individuals when buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard.
B. District Boundaries.
1. The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of the Borough of Lititz,
Lancaster County, which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as
identified in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated April 19, 2005 and the
accompanying maps as prepared for by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof.
2. Where the complete and definite information necessary to delineate the boundary
of the Floodplain District or to determine the 100-year flood elevation
(approximate zones) is not available to the Zoning Officer in his consideration of
an application for a permit, he shall require such on-site studies and/or surveys to
be made as necessary to fix the precise boundaries of the Floodplain District and
the elevation of the 100-year flood as defined in this Section. Such studies and
surveys shall be signed, sealed and certified by a licensed, professional engineer
registered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to perform such studies and
surveys. Such certification shall acknowledge the accuracy of the study or survey
and the qualifications of the individual to perform such study or survey. Copies of
such studies and surveys may be submitted by the Zoning Officer to the Borough
Engineer and the United States Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation
Service, who shall have 30 days to comment. Any property owner whose property
is so studied and/or surveyed to justify an application for a permit shall pay all
costs of these studies and surveys.
3. All changes to the boundaries of the Floodplain District are subject to the review
and approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator for compliance with the
Rules and Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program.
C. Boundary Disputes.
1. Should any person dispute the initial boundary determination of the Floodplain
District as determined by the Zoning Officer from the information referred to in
Section 215.C., an appeal may be made to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden
of proof in such an appeal shall be on the property owner. The property owner
shall pay costs in accordance with established procedures for a Zoning Hearing
Board appeal.
2. The provisions of this Section create an overlay zoning district which is applicable
within floodplains in all zoning districts established by this Ordinance, as defined
and delineated by this Section. To the extent that the provisions of this Section
are applicable and more restrictive, they shall supersede conflicting provisions
within all other Articles of this Ordinance, and all other ordinances of the
Borough of Lititz shall remain in full force and effect.

SECTION 219. Lititz Run Revitalization District
A. Purpose
Lititz Run has been the heart of our community since its earliest days. However, generations of industrial use have left the stream corridor to be underutilized and impacted by an overabundance of paved surfaces.

The purpose of the Lititz Run Revitalization District is to allow for appropriate commercial and residential development that achieves the vision set forth in the Downtown Redevelopment Plan. Such development would connect and complement both Downtown and the residences along Front Street while incentivizing the restoration of Lititz Run.

SECTION 322. Demolition
No structure shall be demolished without a permit obtained under this provision, except for

A. Process
An applicant desiring the demolition of an accessory structure that is not listed as Class I or
II by the Historic Resources Survey shall apply directly to the Zoning Officer for a permit.
All other requests for demolition shall be treated as a conditional use request under the PA
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. As such, the Lititz Borough Planning
Commission shall review each demolition request and offer their findings to Borough
Council for consideration. Borough Council shall make a decision whether to grant or deny
the permit.
B. Request Procedure
A request for demolition can be filed with the Borough on any business day. However, the
Planning Commission may review a request at a particular meeting only if the plan was
filed at least twenty-one (21) calendar days prior to the meeting. In the case that the
structure is within the Lititz Historic District (Lititz-Moravian Historic District), the request
shall concurrently be submitted to the Historic Area Advisory Committee (HAAC) as well.
C. Request Requirements
A written request shall be submitted to the Borough with the following materials.
1. A description of the structure in question, with the year it was built and Historic
Resource class designation, if available.

depicting the subsequent redevelopment of the site is provided to the Borough.
D. Criteria for Review
The burden of proof is on the property owner to demonstrate that the property owner has
been deprived any profitable use of the relevant parcel as a whole. The recommendation of
the Planning Commission and the decision of Borough Council shall be based upon a
review of the information submitted by the Applicant against all criteria and not any one
criterion. The Purpose and Community Development Objectives of Section 101 and 102
shall also be considered.
1. It is not feasible to continue the current use.
2. Other uses permitted within the underlying zoning district, either as permitted uses,
special exception uses, or conditional uses, have been denied or are not feasible due
to constraints on the building or structure.

structure or property.
4. The building, its permitted uses, and adaptive use potential does not provide a
reasonable rate of return, based on a reasonable initial investment. Such reasonable

5. The Applicant has not contributed to the existing conditions, either through neglect
or prior renovation, conversion, alteration or similar physical action.
6. The demolition will not adversely affect the character of the property, streetscape,
neighborhood or community.
7. A proposed new building, structure or use (if applicable) on or of the property will
not adversely affect the character of the streetscape, neighborhood or community.
8. The building is structurally unsound.
9. The denial of demolition would result in unreasonable economic hardship to the
owner.
10. Sale of the building or structure is impossible or impractical.

2. Issuance of any necessary zoning approvals; and
3. The recording of the approved subdivision or land development plan for the parcel where the demolition is proposed.
F. Pre-demolition Requirements
In those instances where an application for demolition is approved, the building(s) to be demolished shall be historically and photographically documented. The extent of the documentation shall be determined by the significance of the building(s). When documentation is complete the building shall be dismantled and recycled to the greatest extent possible.
Electronic copies of all documentation shall be submitted to the Borough and a full set of
hard copies shall be forwarded to the Lititz Historical Foundation.

SECTION 401. Home Occupations and Home Businesses.
A. Background. The Borough recognizes the need to establish regulations pertaining to
home-based occupations and businesses as a result of the increased need for the diversity
of income to help offset the rising cost of living. Home occupations and home businesses
will particularly benefit individuals with physical disabilities as well as those having to
care for children or the elderly within their home. The Borough also recognizes the
potential benefits to the local community which could be realized by those seeking
services or goods supplied through home occupations. However, these positive aspects
must be weighed against the potential impacts of such uses on the residential character of
the neighborhood.
B. Purpose. It is the intent of this Section to establish regulations which will permit home
occupations and home businesses in a manner which will preserve the peace, quiet, and
tranquility of residential neighborhoods and to ensure the compatibility of such uses with

vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical or electronic interference, including
interference with radio or television reception , which is detectable in the
neighborhood.

his/her review and decision. Challenges to decisions of the Zoning Officer go to the Zoning Hearing Board for review.
Any proposed alteration, addition, reconstruction or rehabilitation within the Historic Overlay District should be in substantial compliance with the standards as stated below:

b. The historic character of a property should be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property should be avoided.
c. Each property should be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
d. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right should be retained and preserved.
e. Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved.

L. Effect of Board's Decision.
1. If the variance or special exception is granted or the issuance of a permit is finally approved, or other action by the appellant or applicant is authorized, the necessary permit shall be secured and the authorized action begun within six (6) months after the date when the variance or special exception is finally granted, or the issuance of a permit is finally approved or the other action by the appellant or
Lititz Borough Zoning Ordinance Page 200
§ 603. § 604.
applicant is authorized and provided further that the building or alteration, as the
case may be, shall be completed within twelve (12) months of authorization by the
Zoning Hearing Board. For good cause, the Board, upon application by the
developer in writing stating the reasons therefore, may grant an extension or
extensions of time for the commencement of the authorized in six (6) month
increments, or may grant an extension or extensions of time for the completion of
the authorized action in six (6) month increments. Where time allowed for the
commencement of the authorized action has been granted an extension, the time
allowed for the completion of the authorized action shall be automatically
extended by an equal amount of time.
2. Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary permits within the
required period, or having obtained the permit should he fail to commence work
thereunder within such period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the applicant
has withdrawn or abandoned his appeal or his application, and all provisions,
variances, special exceptions and permits granted to him shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by the said Board.
3. Should the appellant or applicant commence construction or alteration within the
required period but fail to complete such construction or alteration within such
period, the Board may, upon ten (10) days' notice in writing, rescind or revoke the
granted variance or special exception, or the issuance of the permit or permits, or
the other action authorized to the appellant or applicant, if the board finds that no
good cause appears for the failure to complete such construction or alteration
within such period, and if the Board further finds that conditions have so altered
or changed in the interval since the granting of the variance, special exception,
permit or action, that revocation or recision of the action is justified.

C. Applicability of Judicial Remedies. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to deny the applicant the right to proceed directly to court where appropriate, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure No. 1091 (relating to action in mandamus).
SECTION 605. Functions.
A. Variances.
1. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
a. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
b. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
c. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
d. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
e. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
2. In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and the Municipalities Planning Code. Once imposed, a violation of those conditions shall be treated as any other violation of the Zoning
Lititz Borough Zoning Ordinance Page 203
§ 605. § 608.
Ordinance.
B. Special Exceptions. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions in accordance with the standards and criteria set forth in Article IV of this Ordinance. In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Ordinance and of the Municipalities Planning Code. Once imposed, a violation of those conditions shall be treated as any other violation of the Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 606. Parties Appellant before Zoning Hearing Board.
Appeals under Section 604.A. may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or agency of the Borough, or any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance under Section 605.A., and for special exception under Section 605.B. may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by any landowner, equitable owner, or tenant with the permission of such landowner.
SECTION 607. Time Limitations.
A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning Hearing Board later than thirty (30) days after any application for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate Borough officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map pursuant to Section 610 shall preclude an appeal from the final approval except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the approved preliminary approval.
B. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowners shall be filed by the landowner within thirty (30) days after notice of the determination is issued.
SECTION 608. Stay of Proceedings.
Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section 606 and during its pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate
Lititz Borough Zoning Ordinance Page 204
§ 608. § 609.
agency or body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by persons other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board.
SECTION 609. Validity of Ordinance: Substantive Questions.
A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest shall submit the challenge either (1) to the Zoning Hearing Board or (2) to Borough Council, in accordance with the requirements of the Municipalities Planning Code.

PLAN PROCESSING PROCEDURES
SECTION 301. General. This article sets forth the application requirements for obtaining approval of subdivision and land developments. The form of the various plans referred to in this Article and information required to be forwarded with such plans shall be as specified in Article IV.
SECTION 302. Pre-Application Review (Sketch Plan). Applicants are urged to discuss possible development sites and plans with the Borough Planning Commission prior to formal submission of any plan. The purpose of the pre-application meeting or sketch plan review is to afford the Applicant an opportunity to receive the advice and assistance of the Borough Planning Commission. Submission of a sketch plan is optional and shall not constitute formal filing of a plan with the Borough.
Prospective Applicants submitting a pre-application plan for review by the Planning Commission should generally include those items listed in Section 401 of this Ordinance. Although all the plan information outlined by Section 401 is not required to be shown on the sketch plan, the amount of information actually provided should be proportional to the size and intensity of the proposed activity. Plans shall be considered for informal review and discussion and shall not constitute formal filing of the plan with the Borough. The Applicant shall attempt to follow any comments or concerns of the Planning Commission and staff and attempt to address these items in the preliminary plans.
SECTION 303. Formal Application. All applications for approval of a subdivision plan, land development plan, or improvement construction plan shall be made with the Borough by the Developer filing an Application Form, together with the appropriate plans, studies, reports, supporting data, and required filing fee.

A. Initial Application. All applications shall be submitted to the Borough Secretary at least twenty-one calendar days (21) prior to the next regular meeting of the Borough Planning Commission. Within said twenty-one (21) days the Borough staff shall check the plans and documents to determine if on their face they are in proper form and contain all information required by this Ordinance and report their findings at the next regular meeting of the Borough Planning Commission. At their regular meeting the Borough Planning Commission shall accept the application for filing or reject the application as defective. If defective, the application shall be returned to the Applicant with a statement of rejection. Acceptance for filing shall not, however, constitute a waiver of any deficiencies or irregularities.
B. Amendments or Corrections to an Application. The Borough shall examine amended or corrected applications filed to determine whether such amended or corrected application results in a substantial amendment to the plan or in the filing of a plan so changed as to be considered a new plan. If the Borough determines that the amended or corrected
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 17
§ 304. § 305.
application constitutes a substantial amendment, he shall so inform the Applicant that the Borough shall consider the ninety (90) day review procedure to have been restarted as

G. The Borough reserves the right to reject any submitted wetland delineations. Should the Borough feel the actual wetland area differs from that shown on the subdivision or land development plan, the Borough has the right to secure, at the developer's expense, qualified personnel to check the delineation and redraw the boundary as necessary. Should the developer subsequently disagree with the Borough's delineation, a jurisdictional delineation by DEP and COE shall be requested. Any charges for the jurisdictional delineation shall be the responsibility of the developer.
H. Where the study shows the existence of wetland areas, the delineated boundary shall be properly fenced off to prevent encroachment. Snow fence or other acceptable material shall be used (the use of silt fence is not acceptable). The fence shall be properly installed, at a minimum distance of five (5) feet outside the delineated boundary, prior to any construction or issuance of building permits. The fence shall be properly maintained until all occupancy permits have been issued and/or for the extent of all construction. The applicant shall obtain any necessary Zoning Hearing Board approvals for fence within the floodplain.

IMPROVEMENT CONSTRUCTION ASSURANCES
SECTION 501. Completion of Improvements or Guarantee Thereof Prerequisite to Final Plan Approval.
A. No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets and alleys shown on such plan have been improved as may be required by this Ordinance, and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, storm water management facilities, or other improvements as may be required by this Ordinance have been installed in accordance with this Ordinance, except that the surface course of streets and alleys shall not be completed until such time as ninety (90) percent of the lots in the subdivision or land development have been improved by the construction of a residential dwelling, commercial structure, industrial structure, or other non-residential structure. For the purpose of this article, an improved lot shall be considered completed when all building construction and site improvements are finished to the point that in the opinion of the Borough, a Certificate of Occupancy could be issued. In lieu of completion of the surface course of streets and alleys as well as in lieu of completion of other improvements required as a condition for Final Plan approval of a plan, at the discretion of the developer, such developer may deposit with the Borough a letter of credit, or other financial security authorized by the Municipalities Planning Code and acceptable to the Borough Council in an amount equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the estimated cost of the required improvements at a time ninety (90) days following the date scheduled for completion of the respective improvements by the developer. The estimated cost of the surface course shall be computed separately from the estimated cost of completing the other improvements and shall be based upon the developer's projected timetable for completion of the development.
B. The amount of financial security required by the Borough shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of the improvements, submitted by a developer and prepared by a Professional Engineer and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The Borough, upon the recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the developer and the Borough are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Borough and the developer. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the Borough and the developer.
C. Annually the Borough may adjust the amount of required financial security by redetermining the estimated cost for completion of the uncompleted improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth (90th) day after either date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Borough may require
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 48
§ 501. § 502.
the developer to post additional security in order to insure that the financial security equals one hundred ten (110) percent of the estimated cost of the Borough completing the improvements at a time ninety (90) days following the date scheduled for completion or alternatively reduce the required security so that it equals such amount. Any additional security shall be posted by the developer within thirty (30) days after being notified of the same. The amount of financial security required by the Authority shall be computed in accordance with the Authority's rules and regulations.
D. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request the Borough to release or authorize the release from time to time, such portions of the financial security necessary for the payment to the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing addressed to the Borough Council, and the Borough Council shall have forty-five (45) days from the receipt of such request to allow the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough Council that such portion of the work has been completed in accordance with the approved plan. Upon such certification, the Borough Council shall authorize release from the required financial security of an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer as representing the value of the work completed.
E. The value of the work completed shall be determined by subtracting one hundred ten
(110) percent of the estimated cost of the completion of the remaining uncompleted work from the total amount of security deposited.
F. At such time as ninety (90) percent of the lots in the subdivision have been improved as set forth above, or if at the expiration of three (3) years from the date all of the improvements excepting the surface course has been completed, less than ninety (90) percent of the lots have been so improved, the Borough may notify the developer to complete the surface course within sixty (60) days from the date of such notice. In computing the sixty (60) day requirement, the period from October 1 to April 1 shall not be counted.
G. If at the time the surface course is completed, ninety (90) percent of the lots are not improved as set forth above, the developer must post with the Borough financial security in an amount equal to fifteen (15) percent of the reasonable cost of the surface course as security to guarantee that damages to the road or street will not occur during the completion of the improvements on the unimproved lots in such developer's subdivision or land development. The Borough shall hold such financial security and utilize it to pay for the repair of any damage occurring to the road during the period between the commencement of improvements on any particular unimproved lot and the completion of such improvements irrespective of whether or not it can be established that the damage to the road was caused by contractors or other persons working in and about the construction of such improvements. The financial security shall be in a form acceptable to the Borough.
SECTION 502. Effect of Plan Recording on Dedication and Reservations. Recording of the final plan after approval of the Borough Council has the effect of an irrevocable offer to:
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 49
§ 502. § 503.
A. Dedicate all streets and other public ways to public use, unless such streets are indicated on said plan as private streets.
B. Dedicate all neighborhood parks and all areas shown on the plan as being local recreation Sites and open space to public use.
SECTION 503. Release from Financial Security.
A. When the developer has completed all of the improvements as shown on the final plans, the developer shall notify the Borough Council, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements, enclosing therewith certification by the engineer responsible for the design of the improvements that they have been installed as designed, and shall send copies of the notice and certification to the Borough Engineer. The Borough Council shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer shall thereupon file a report, in writing, with the Borough Council and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Borough Council, said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements or any portion thereof shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Borough Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of the reasons for such non-approval or rejection. Improvements shall not be considered completed unless the developer can demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance, and all other applicable ordinances, statutes and regulations. Improvements shall also not be considered complete until As-Built Plans of all improvements to be dedicated to the Borough and of all streets, whether or not such streets shall be dedicated, have been submitted to the Borough. If storm water infiltration is proposed, post construction infiltration testing shall be conducted prior to the release of financial security.
B. The Borough Council shall notify the developer within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered mail, of its action with relation thereto. If the Borough Council or Borough Engineer fails to comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, or such time limitations as contained in the Municipalities Planning Code, whichever requirements shall contain a longer time period for action by the Borough, all improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the developer's posted financial security shall be released.
C. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
D. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise any determination of the Borough Council or Borough Engineer.
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 50
§ 504. § 505.
SECTION 504. Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements. In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been installed as provided in this Ordinance or in accordance with the approved Final Plan, the Borough Council may enforce any letter of credit or other financial security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If proceeds of such financial security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, the Borough Council may, at its option, install such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action or recover the monies necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All the proceeds, after deducting the costs of collection, whether resulting from the financial security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not for any other Borough purpose.
SECTION 505. Inspection During Construction. The Borough shall inspect the improvements during construction. The developer shall pay the cost of any such inspection in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the Municipalities Planning Code. The developer shall provide at least twenty-four (24) hours notice prior to the start of construction of any improvements that are subject to inspection. All inspections of completed items shall be requested, in writing, at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the inspection time and date.
The following phases of site construction shall have mandatory inspection. This list of phases may be amended by mutual agreement of the Borough and developer when the site requires special construction procedures. The inspection schedule shall be recorded with the Final Plan or shown on the approved improvement construction plan.
A. General Site Construction.
1. Upon completion of preliminary site preparation including stripping of vegetation, stockpiling of topsoil and construction of temporary soil erosion and sedimentation control devices.
2. Upon completion of rough grading, but prior to placing topsoil, permanent drainage, or other site development improvements and groundcovers.
3. During the construction of permanent storm water management and BMP facilities. All storm sewers, culverts, etc. shall be inspected prior to backfilling.
4. During construction of sanitary sewers and appurtenances, all sanitary sewers shall be constructed and inspected in accordance with Borough specifications.
5. Upon the final completion of permanent storm water management and BMP facilities, including the establishment of ground covers and plantings.
6. After review of the As-Built drawings, required by Section 508 of this Ordinance, but prior to final release of the financial guarantee for completion of final grading, vegetative controls required by the BMP standards, or other site restoration work.
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 51
§ 505. § 507.
B. Street Construction.
1. Preparation of Road Subgrade. At the time of this inspection, the subgrade shall be proof rolled and the proposed crown and grade should be checked. A developer's/contractor's representative shall accompany the observer when the crown and grade are checked. Proof rolling shall be performed with a fully loaded, tandem-axle dump truck. This inspection shall occur prior to any stone subbase being placed.
2. Placement and Compaction of Road Subbase. At the time of this inspection, the depth of subbase shall be checked after compaction, the subbase shall be proof rolled in the same manner as the subgrade and the crown and grade shall be checked again. This inspection shall occur prior to any binder or base course being placed.
3. Placement and Compaction of the Binder/Base Course. At the time of this inspection, the depth of the binder/base course shall be checked, ambient temperature shall be monitored (this is important in early spring and late fall days when the temperature can go below acceptable limits, in accordance with PennDOT specifications, Form 408, as amended), the temperature of the bituminous material shall be checked (if possible), and it is recommended that copies of the weight slips for each truckload are obtained. The crown and grade shall also be checked again. This inspection shall occur prior to the wearing course being placed.
4. Placement and Compaction of the Wearing Course. At the time of this inspection, the guidelines for the placement and compaction of the binder/base course shall be followed.
C. In addition to the above outlined inspections, additional inspections shall be made at the request of the developer for reduction of financial securities. Random inspections shall be made at the frequency desired by the municipality. At the time of any of the above listed inspections, all ongoing construction (i.e. storm drainage, sanitary sewer, water, erosion control, etc.) shall also be checked for compliance with the approved plans and the findings reported. Since the above inspections are mandatory, requests for reduction of financial guarantee shall be submitted to coincide with the above inspections.
SECTION 506. Maintenance of Streets. The developer shall maintain all streets and alleys in the subdivision or development in travelable condition, including the prompt removal of snow and ice therefrom, until such time as the streets and alleys are accepted by the Borough as part of the Borough street system; or, if such streets are not to be dedicated, until a Homeowners Association or other entity responsible for the maintenance of the streets and alleys has been formed.
SECTION 507. Construction In Accordance With Plans. All streets, alleys and drainage facilities shall be constructed in strict accordance with the approved plans and no changes shall
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 52
§ 507. § 508.
be effected unless the same receive the written authorization of the Borough. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the Borough may require changes during the construction stage where onsite conditions, in the opinion of the Borough, or its duly designated representative, indicates that the adverse effect of stormwater runoff and/or the adverse effect to the roadbed and/or road surface may be minimized by such changes.
SECTION 508. As-Built Plan. At such time as the construction of the road is found to meet all requirements of this Ordinance and the approved plans, as modified, the Developer, prior to offering the road for dedication, shall submit to the Borough a mylar and, an electronic version of the As-Built Plan of the road and any stormwater drainage facilities which shall form a part of the permanent records of the Borough. The plan shall be prepared by using the approved Final Plan as a base plan and shall be made available to the Borough prior to the final inspection of the project. As-Built Plans shall show the following:
A. Actual location of all concrete monuments which were set at all angle breaks, points of curvature and tangents around the perimeter of the total tract. When the outside perimeter of a tract falls within or along an existing road right-of-way, then the right-of-way of that roadway shall be monumented at the above referenced points.
B. Actual location of all iron pins or drill holes in curbs for all individual lot lines.
C. Actual cul-de-sac radii.
D. Actual location of cartway centerline versus right-of-way centerline.
E. Actual location of floodplain by elevation and dimension from property line.
F. Actual location and cross section of swales and accompanying easements.

§ 509. § 510.
SECTION 509. Dedication. In case of a street or alley through residential properties, at such time as ninety (90%) percent of the lots fronting on the street have received occupancy permits, or in the case of a street through commercial, industrial or other non-residential developments, when lots having ninety (90%) percent of the footage have received occupancy permits, the Developer may offer the Borough a deed of dedication, accompanied by a fee to cover recording costs and costs of preparing the Resolution of Acceptance and recording of the same. If the deed is found to be in proper order and there are no violations of any provision of this Ordinance, the Borough Council, may at its sole discretion, adopt a Resolution accepting the street or alley and or in applicable cases, drainage facility. No street or alley, or in applicable cases, drainage facility, shall be considered finally accepted by the Borough until the deed has been recorded and filed with the applicable offices for filing for Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Notwithstanding final acceptance of the street, alley or drainage facility, the developer shall remain responsible for maintenance of the same, snow removal excepted, for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of final acceptance.
SECTION 510. Development Agreement. Final Plan approval may, at the sole discretion of Borough Council, be subject to the signing of a Development Agreement prepared by the Borough Solicitor pertaining to the laying out of streets, service lanes, or alleys and the construction of all improvements including necessary grading, paving, curbs, soil erosion and sediment control, gutters, sidewalks, street lights, fire hydrants, water mains, underground electric facilities, landscaping, and traffic control devices, in accordance with the approved final plans, where such (or some of them) improvements are required as a condition of the approval of the plan by the Borough Council, within the time or times specified in the approval. The agreement may include any other specified conditions or requirements agreed to by the Borough Council and developer and/or owner.
The developer and/or owner shall reimburse the Borough for the legal fee and filing cost incurred for the preparation and recording of this agreement (or memorandum thereof).

2. Streets shall be designed with consideration to both existing and planned streets. All streets shall be arranged to conform as closely as possible to the original topography. New streets shall be connected with streets of similar function, to form continuations thereof. Local streets shall be laid out to discourage use by through traffic. Streets shall be laid out to provide convenient and safe access to the property. Where a development abuts an existing or proposed arterial or collector street, the Borough Council may require the use of reverse frontage lots or such other treatment that will provide protection for abutting properties, reduce the number of intersections with the major street and separate the local and through traffic.
3. Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce, satisfactory drainage and suitable building sites.
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 55
§ 602. § 602.
4. Half streets, or streets centered upon a boundary line of a tract to be subdivided shall be prohibited. All plans shall be designed to provide for the entire right-of- way and cartway widths.
5. When existing stub streets, temporary cul-de-sac streets, or dedicated or platted areas reserved for future street usage join the tract to be developed, they shall be extended into the site and made part of the proposed street layout. Where a temporary cul-de-sac is being extended, the bulb shall be reconstructed to Borough street specifications, any existing sidewalk extended through the area and the remaining areas shall be regraded and seeded.
6. The extension of existing streets which are presently constructed with a cartway different from current Borough standards shall be provided with a transition area, the design of which is subject to Borough approval.
7. All existing streets at the perimeter and/or through the development shall be reconstructed according to Borough or PennDOT specifications: (1) if an existing street lies at the perimeter of the development, it shall be reconstructed to the centerline of the street; and (2) if an existing street lies through the development, it shall be reconstructed to the full width of the street as required by Borough or PennDOT specifications and design standards.
8. When the proposed development requires construction within an existing street right-of-way, such as sewer, water or storm water lines, the Borough may require construction of a new wearing course along the frontage and/or disturbed area.
9. If lots resulting from original subdivision are large enough to permit re- subdivision or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, adequate rights-of-way for streets and other required improvements shall be reserved as necessary to permit further subdivision and be reflected in the Borough Official Map.
10. As a minimum, all new streets shall be graded to the right-of-way line. All cut and fill banks shall not exceed a maximum of 3:1 slope.
11. Streets shall be designed to preclude or minimize the need for guide rail. The Borough may, however, require guide rail to be placed for protection on embankments when a barrier is indicated as warranted in Design Manual Part 2 Highway Design by PennDOT, as amended. The design and selection of guide rail shall generally be in accordance with the standards in Design Manual Part 2 Highway Design, as amended, however, the Borough shall approve all guide rail systems.
12. Streets and alleys that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets and alleys. Street and alley names shall not be repeated within the Borough and all street and alley names shall be subject to the approval of the Borough, the Postmaster, and Lancaster County Wide Communications.

6. Drainage of cul-de-sac streets shall preferably be toward the open end. If drainage is toward the closed end, water shall be conveyed away in an underground storm sewer or by other means approved by the Borough. The minimum grade on
cul-de-sacs shall be designed to ensure a minimum of one (1) percent along the curb line to the designed low points.
7. Temporary cul-de-sacs shall be constructed within the right-of-way for a future street extension.
E. Close. The Design Standards for a Close shall be in accordance with Article VIII, Form-Based Code Regulations of the Zoning Ordinance.
F. Street Intersections.
1. Intersections involving the junction of more than two (2) streets shall be prohibited.
2. The centerline of streets opening onto the opposite sides of existing or proposed streets shall be directly opposite from each other. When this is physically impossible, the distance between centerlines shall be no less than one hundred and fifty (150) feet between centerlines, measured along the centerline of the street being intersected.
3. Intersections with arterial or collector streets shall be located not closer than one thousand (1,000) feet, measured from centerline to centerline, along the centerline of the arterial or collector street being intersected.
4. Right angle intersections shall be used.
5. The cartway edge at street intersections shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a minimum radius of thirty-five (35) feet for local streets or lanes and fifty (50) feet for intersections involving arterial and collector streets. The right-of-way radii at intersections shall be substantially concentric with the edge of the cartway. The Borough may require larger radii based on the largest design vehicle using the intersection.
6. All streets intersecting a state highway shall be subject to the approval of PennDOT. A PennDOT Highway Occupancy Permit shall be required prior to any construction involving a PennDOT right-of-way.
7. There shall be provided and maintained at all intersections a clear sight triangle with a line of sight between points of one hundred (100) feet from the intersection of the centerlines for collectors and seventy five (75) feet for local streets. Clear

§ 602. § 602.
sight triangles shall be indicated on all plans. No building or other obstruction that would obscure the vision of a motorist shall be permitted within these areas.
8. Proper safe stopping sight distance shall be provided with respect to both horizontal and vertical road alignments at all intersections. Sight distance at street intersections shall be such to provide the sight distance in accordance with current PennDOT criteria.
a. Appendix No. 21 depicts stopping sight distance for selected speeds. The sight distances in Appendix No. 21 apply for roadway grades in whole numbers from +13% to -13% along with speeds from fifteen (15) to sixty
(60) miles per hour in increments of five (5) miles per hour. The designer may use this table in lieu of the above formula.
b. Inadequate Sight Distance Remedies. If it is impossible to achieve required safe stopping sight distance in both directions the Borough may:
(1) Prohibit left turns by entering or exiting vehicles;
(2) Require alteration of the horizontal or vertical geometry of the roadway or access; all such work shall be at the expense of the Applicant;
(3) Require removal of physical obstruction from the line of sight, at the expense of the Applicant;
(4) Require installation of a separate left turn standby lane; or
(5) Deny access to the roadway.
G. Future Rights-of-Way
1. Future rights-of-way are rights-of-way reserved for future street extension into adjoining tracts. They shall be designed in conformance with the design requirements of a street, and the contiguous parcels must contain proper setbacks and sight distances.
a. The area within the future right-of-way shall be included within the deeds to the abutting lots with an easement in favor of the Borough and land owners of the land into which the future right-of-way will extend to permit the use of the future right-of-way for public street purposes should the adjoining lands be developed. Reserved rights-of-way may be permitted only when they will be no longer than the depth of one (1) lot. For lengths longer than one (1) lot a fully constructed stub street and temporary cul- de-sac shall be required.
b. The landowners of the lots in which the future right-of-way is included shall have the duty to maintain the area included within the future right-of- way and this duty shall be indicated in a note on the final plan and in all deeds to such lots.
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 60

3. Lighting proposed for use after eleven (11) p.m., or after the normal hours of operation, shall be reduced by an average of seventy-five percent (75%) from that time until dawn, unless supporting a specific purpose.
4. Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary means for controlling Glare.
Lititz Borough Subdivision Land Development Ordinance 80
§ 614. § 614.
5. The intensity of illumination projected onto an existing residential use from an existing property boundary shall not exceed the following vertical Footcandle, measured at the existing property line at a height of 5 feet;

b. 0.2 Footcandles in the Districts immediately adjoining the Downtown.
c. 0.1 Footcandle in other Districts.
6. Directional fixtures, e.g., floodlights and spotlights, shall be so shielded, installed and aimed that they do not project their output into the windows of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, past the object being illuminated, skyward or onto a public roadway or pedestrian way.
7. Externally illuminated billboards and signs shall be lighted by fixtures mounted at the top of the billboard or sign and aimed downward. The fixtures shall be designed, shielded and aimed to shield the source from off-site view and to restrict the light output onto and not beyond the sign or billboard. At no point on the face of the sign or billboard shall the illumination exceed 30 initial vertical footcandles with a maximum to minimum uniformity ration not to exceed 6:1.
8. Only the United States and the state flag shall be permitted to be illuminated from dusk till dawn. All other flags shall not be illuminated past 11:00 p.m. Flag lighting sources shall not exceed 7,000 initial lamp lumens per flagpole.

20.20
All benches to be placed within the Boroughs public outdoor spaces shall be model # PRS127 (with a
center bench arm) manufactured by Victor Stanley Inc in a color to replicate the Boroughs street light
pole color, or Borough-approved equal. The Borough may consider suggested bench alternatives. In
some settings, a backless bench may be used to provide seating orientation options. Typically, benches
with backs shall be provided, and backs shall be oriented to permit direct views of passing pedestrians
and motorists from bench seats.
Benches shall be provided at all public gathering spaces including greens, plazas, squares, pocket
parks, and bus stops.
Benches shall not obstruct pedestrian travel zones required for ADA compliance, nor building entrances
and fire hydrant access.
All benches shall be permanently mounted to secured paving materials per the bench manufacturers
specifications, and leveling hardware shall be used to compensate for sloping pavement conditions
where applicable.
While bench donor recognition plaques may be permitted following plaque design review by the
Borough, no commercial logos and/or outdoor advertising will be permitted on public site furnishings.

20.27
Because the installation of moveable furnishings is temporary in nature and subject to the aesthetic
preferences of business owners, specific tables and chair selections are not required. All moveable
furnishings must, however, be made of safe, sturdy, and durable materials such as wood, steel,
aluminum, or wrought iron. They must also be of commercial grade and specifically manufactured for
outdoor use. Tables may be no larger than two (2) feet and six (6) inches wide, and they should visually
complement adjacent chairs.
Moveable furnishings shall not encroach into pedestrian travel zones required for ADA compliance, nor
obstruct building entrances and fire hydrant access.
Neither moveable tables nor chairs may be secured to sidewalk pavement, street lights, trees, benches
or other public site furnishings.
In addition to tables and chairs, outdoor cafes must include securely mounted litter receptacles (see
p.194.4), if such receptacles do not currently exist within twenty (20) feet of the cafe area.
All moveable furnishings must be regularly cleaned and maintained. They must be stored indoors and/
or out of the public rights-of-ways beyond seasonal periods of cafe operation.

Although durable and easy to maintain, concrete sidewalk paving does not permit essential air and water penetration to street tree root
zones, and it must be destroyed, thrown away, and replaced whenever access to underground utilities is required. Furthermore, concrete
colors and patterns of replaced paving sections rarely match earlier paving areas. For these reasons, a continuous brick sidewalk paving
band shall be provided adjacent to Downtown street curbs wherever more than fifty (50) feet of contiguous Streetscape improvements are
proposed. For smaller Downtown areas, this brick paving band may be omitted, but use of porous concrete paving is recommended in
its place.
All other Borough sidewalks separated from a street curb by an unpaved area (i.e. tree lawn) shall be concrete, but such concrete shall not
be colored and/or patterned to falsely replicate other paving materials such as stone and/or brick.
Downtown brick paving bands shall extend two (2) feet and four (4) inches from the back of a street curb unless such width is greater than
40% of the overall sidewalk width. In such areas, the band width may be reduced, but it shall be consistent throughout an entire block.
Downtown sidewalk areas located between required brick paving bands and building facades shall be paved with concrete (preferably
porous concrete), and shall not include surface color or texture treatments which attempt to falsely replicate other paving materials.
Paving bricks for sidewalks shall be model 2-1/4x4x8 Brick Paver manufactured by Watsontown Brick Company in standard red color.
They shall be set in a non-mortared 90 degree Herringbone Pattern over stable, well-compacted base materials which permit stormwater
infiltration (except at street intersections and driveways where a concrete base material may be used to withstand occasional vehicular
encroachment).
Brick and concrete sidewalk paving (designed for vehicular use) shall extend across access drives and shall not be interrupted with
bituminous paving.
Accessible sidewalk ramps with ADA-approved detectable sidewalk warnings shall be provided and such warnings shall visually contrast
with surrounding paved areas. Detectable warning materials composed of raised truncated domes shall be presented to the Borough for
approval.
20.10
Site Design Standards
Crosswalks
20.51 To promote greater visual continuity among
the Boroughs diverse public spaces,
selection of open space amenities such

20.53
20.54
20.55
20.56
Crosswalks shall be located at all downtown street intersections, connecting opposing accessible
sidewalk ramps.
In most Crosswalk locations, heat-applied Crosswalk Striping shall be provided. Such
Crosswalks shall be six (6) to ten (10) feet wide and shall be immediately re-striped whenever
removal of bituminous paving and subsequent street patching occurs, and when striping
becomes worn from regular use.
As a viable alternative to striped Crosswalks, textured paving consisting of brick (2-3/4 inch,
model #36 Red Sunset manufactured by Whitacre-Greer) shall be installed on a reinforced
concrete base to address pedestrian safety and vehicular traffic calming. Such Crosswalks
shall be edged with flush concrete curb to create a visual and functional transition between brick
pavers and adjoining bituminous paving. Brick Crosswalk pavers are to be set at a 90 degree
herringbone paving pattern, and the overall Crosswalk width shall be ten (10) feet.
Crosswalks shall not be constructed of colored and stamped bituminous paving due to visual
inconsistency of such materials with the Boroughs built environment, and due to increased
maintenance inherent to such paving practices.

sides of a street. To address dark sky initiatives by reducing light pollution and light
trespass, model # K118 Washington luminaires with VL1 Cut Off Optical System
manufactured by King Luminaire Ornamental Lighting shall be used.
Street Lights and street trees shall be located to achieve proper spacing for street
and sidewalk illumination levels desired by the Borough Engineer, and to minimize
impacts with open doors of vehicles parked in on-street parking spaces.

20.65
Poles and posts for mounting signs and/or signals shall be fiberglass, aluminum, cast
iron, steel, or painted wood. Unpainted wood sign poles/posts shall not be used.
Poles which accommodate traffic signalization must closely replicate the standard
color and form of PPLs Washington Boulevard street light poles.
To reduce visual Streetscape clutter, signs providing vehicular wayfinding and
regulations shall be consolidated on shared sign poles, or securely attached to nearby
street light or traffic signal poles wherever feasible.

20.67
20.68
20.69
20.70
Walls, piers, fences, and hedges with a maximum three (3) feet and six (6) inch height shall be used to effectively delineate Downtown Street Walls, and to provide a clear visual division between public and private outdoor spaces where building facades do not already exist to serve this purpose.
Wall and fence materials shall be architecturally compatible with nearby structures, and shall be constructed of painted wood, indigenous stone, brick, cast limestone, wrought iron, and/or black, powder-coated metal components (excluding chain-link fencing).
Hedges shall be regularly maintained so as to not exceed a three (3) feet and six (6) inch height, nor encroach into public pedestrian areas.
Walls, piers, fences, and hedges may be terminated and/or punctuated with masonry piers, and they may be interrupted by pedestrian-scaled gates. Such gates shall be constructed of painted wood, wrought iron, or black, powder-coated metal.

adjoining sidewalks.
20.15
Site Design Standards
Street Tree Use and Selection
20.72 It is intended that trees will be planted within
the Boroughs Streetscapes, parking areas, and
required landscape buffers to provide a pedestrianscaled
environment, a seasonal succession of
landscape interest, a buffer from undesirable views,
a barrier to the detrimental effects of wind and noise,
and a comfortable shade canopy to lower energy
consumption and reduce carbon dioxide levels.
20.73 With due consideration of mature plant forms, trees
shall be selected to fit a given site context and to
produce desired landscape effects such as shade,
buffers, and/or seasonal vibrancy.

* Other potential plant selections will be considered by the Borough's Shade Tree Commission
20.74 It is intended that trees will be selected for
the Boroughs Streetscapes, parking areas,
and required landscape buffers utilizing
species proven tolerant of urban conditions,
and able to prosper in spite of environmental
and physical constraints (overhead utilities,
nearby building facades, limited root zones,
etc).

20.79
With due consideration of the proposed planting location and existing site constraints, tree types
shall be determined by referring to the appropriate section in the list above. A preference shall
be given to use of native plant species.
Trees for Streetscapes and parking areas shall be responsibly pruned to have bottom tree
branches at least eight (8) feet above sidewalk areas and at least ten (10) feet above vehicular
areas at the time of tree maturity. No street tree shall be smaller than a two (2) inch caliper size
(the diameter of the trunk measured six [6] inches above grade) at the time of tree installation.
Where more than fifty (50) feet of contiguous Streetscape improvements are proposed, such
caliper measurements shall be no less than three (3) inches.
Tree and shrub species selection for required landscape buffers shall be in accordance with
the list provided above, and shall be planted according to quantities established on p.194.25.
Tree species for required landscape buffers shall not have a caliper less than three (3) inches in
size (the diameter of the trunk measured six [6] inches above grade) at the time of installation.
To avoid creation of monocultures consisting of only one plant type, each Borough block shall
include at least two street tree species, and each large buffer area shall include at least three
species.

20.85.a
Street tree spacing requirements have intended variations depending upon selected tree forms at the time of plant maturity, and due to unique contextual considerations inherent to each planting site.
The Tree Lawn of five feet (5) typical as shown on this page is not intended for lots with Commercial Use.
Small street trees selected from the Boroughs approved list of species shall be spaced a minimum of twenty (20) feet and a maximum of forty (40) feet apart.
Mid-sized trees and larger street trees selected from this same list shall be spaced a minimum of forty
(40) feet and a maximum of sixty (60) feet apart.
Street tree placement shall typically occur within the center of a tree lawn or brick sidewalk paving band.
Tree locations shall generally be staggered on opposing sides of a street unless a streets width exceeds forty (40) feet, requiring alignment of proposed lighting and trees on opposite street sides to obtain proper levels of Streetscape illumination. Tree spacing shall be responsive to street light locations which, in turn, shall relate to locations of on- street parking spaces (where spaces are delineated with pavement markings). Careful coordination of tree placement, lighting, and parked vehicles shall prevent blocked lighting patterns and blocked access to car doors caused by poorly located street trees and light poles. Tree placement is subject to existing locations of underground utilities and/ or vaults which potentially extend beneath some sidewalk areas.
Trees shall not be planted within five (5) feet of access drives, within twenty-five (25) feet of existing trees, within bus stop zones, below fire escape balconies, where blockage to building entrances presents safety concerns, or within five (5) feet of hydrants and permanent Streetscape furnishings. Full visibility of traffic signals, street intersections, and wayfinding signage (both vehicular and pedestrian forms) shall always be maintained.
Whenever a lot is used for Commercial Use, a paved area shall be created between the curb and the sidewalk, in lieu of a tree lawn, using brick, concrete, Belgian block, or other approved unit pavers, as well as street trees with a 40 to 60 foot spacing.
20.18
Landscape Design Standards
Street Tree Standards - Planting Details
20.86 For new tree plantings in areas without tree lawns,
and where more than fifty (50) feet of contiguous
Streetscape enhancements are proposed, it is intended
that continuous trenches of structurally engineered soil
be provided parallel to curb-lines to facilitate better root
growth, while permitting air and water to reach critical
root zones. Individual tree planting pits are not permitted
in such areas unless existing tree and utility locations
render continuous trenches infeasible.
20.87 For areas without tree lawns and where continuous
trenches are not required due to a limited Streetscape
improvement area (less than fifty [50] feet overall
sidewalk length), it is intended that trees be installed
within individual planting pits (minimum three [3] feet wide
by three [3] feet long by three [3] feet deep).
20.88 For areas with tree lawns, it is intended that native soil
within the entire width of such unpaved area be amended
to a depth equal to the height of the installed trees root
ball. Structurally engineered soil is not required.
20.89
20.90
20.91
20.92
20.93
20.94
For new tree plantings in areas with tree lawns (unpaved area between curbs and sidewalks), native soils shall be
used in place of structurally engineered soils. Such soils shall be amended with ample organic matter at the time of
tree planting.
Where tree lawns are not permitted and where sidewalks extend to curbs, sidewalk pavements often fail due to tree
root growth. To minimize failure, structurally engineered soil and adequately compacted sub-surface base materials
for sidewalk pavements shall be used. Such soils shall contain a mix of loam, stone, water, and a moisture-retaining
polymers so that weight-bearing loads are transferred from stone to stone, leaving the soil between stones unaffected by
compaction, capable of greater nutrient holding capacity, and enhanced with improved drainage.
Where sidewalks extend to curbs and where continuous trenches are not required, soil within a minimum three (3) feet
wide by three (3) feet long by three (3) feet deep tree planting pit shall be prepared in accordance with section 194.80.
The base of the root collar (area where the trunk transitions to the trees root mass) shall remain above surrounding
soil backfill.
Following tree planting in areas without tree lawns, paving shall be placed over four (4) inches of stone paving subbase
and over structurally engineered soils whcih have been adequately compacted per manufacturers specifications.
Due to associated costs and on-going maintenance, tree grates shall not be used unless specifically approved by the
Borough. Instead, tree plantings in areas without tree lawns and where brick paving bands are required shall be covered
with non-mortared brick pavers (retaining two [2] feet by two [2] feet pavement openings centered on tree trunks), shall
include a sub-surface, paver edge restraint to keep brick pavers in place, and shall be mulched with double-shredded
hardwood mulch (two [2] inch depth). Other newly planted areas shall be covered with either mulch and/or groundcover
plantings. Stone mulch and decorative edgings which extends above the soil surface are not permitted.

20.95 It is intended that all new residential development
(including urban infill redevelopment) respect Front
Yard conditions common to the Boroughs existing
neighborhoods.
20.96 Front Yards for residential infill projects shall replicate
typical building setbacks for existing structures
located on the same block which accommodate
such infill development.

Streetscape Edge Treatments for Off-Street Parking Areas
20.98 Where off-street parking areas are adjacent
to Borough streets, it is intended that
evergreen hedge plantings, appropriate
fencing, and/or masonry structures be used
to delineate the Streetscape edge formed
elsewhere on the same block by building
facades.
20.99
20.100
20.101
Off-street parking areas shall be separated from public Streetscape by a hedge,
fence, wall, pier, and/or masonry structures to retain a pedestrian-scaled Streetscape
environment.
All hedges and fences shall be a maximum three (3) feet and six (6) inches high and
located within a minimum ten (10) feet wide buffer area adjacent to a public sidewalk.
Such edge treatments shall apply to both standard parking areas with bituminous
paving, and parking areas constructed with stabilized turf or other porous paving
materials.

Stormwater Infiltration at Off-Street Parking Area Edges
20.102 Where site topography permits, it is intended
that stormwater run-off will flow to bioinfiltration
areas located at edges of surface,
off-street parking areas.
20.103 Such bio-infiltration areas are intended
to cleanse stormwater pollutants prior
to releasing run-off into the groundwater
system.

20.106
Rather than discharge surface stormwater run-off into a standard stormwater
conveyance system, surface off-street parking areas shall be constructed to direct
flows to bio-infiltration areas located at the edges of such facilities.
Infiltration areas shall be planted with indigenous, facultative plant species (capable of
living under fluctuating environmental conditions brought about by flooding, drought,
and varying levels of oxygen within the soil), and they shall be regularly maintained to
prevent establishment of invasive weeds and/or collection of debris.
Such infiltration areas shall have a minimum ten (10) feet width and shall be
constructed in accordance with Borough Engineer approval.
20.23

In cooperation with Venture Lititz, a non-profit organization whose mission is to enhance and sustain the social and commercial vibrancy of downtown Lititz, Derck & Edson Associates, along with the Delta Development Group, developed this Downtown Lititz Master Plan. This Master Plan incorporates the
planning strategies and goals from the 1999 Joint Strategic Comprehensive Plan for Warwick Township and Lititz Borough, the 2005 Update, as well as Lancaster Countys 2006 Comprehensive Plan. The plan speaks specifically to portions of each of these plans, as outlined here:
1999 Joint Strategic Comprehensive Plan Goals:
· promote and strengthen business opportunities in the downtown
· preserve the community character of the downtown
· recognize the downtown as a gathering place for the regional community
· provide recreational links to the regions center of activities
2005 Joint Comprehensive Plan Update - Physical Development Strategies
· reinvestment area identification - the railroad corridor area contiguous to downtown, between Broad Street and Oak Street
Envision Lancaster County - Comprehensive Plan 2006
· Balance: Urban Growth Area Strategy Goal: Direct more development into designated Urban Growth Areas through reinvestment and new development that improves the quality of life by respecting and reinforcing existing community forms and values
Thanks to Venture Lititz, the Master Plan Steering Committee, the Pennsylvania Downtown Center, the Borough of Lititz, and the Lititz Open Space Board for their assistance during the planning process.
Introduction
It seems every town wants to be like Lititz. Everyone wants to live in Lititz, watch the fireworks in Lititz, and has probably hand-rolled a pretzel in Lititz. The streets of downtown Lititz possess an inherent sense of place that has resonated for more than 250 years. From the early 18th Century Moravian settlement east on Main Street to the 19th Century opening of Wilbur Chocolate and the Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery through 20th Century developments, Lititz has consistently evolved and changed with the times. The early 21st century holds the same promise for Lititz. At this junction in its history, looking forward to the tercentennial celebration in 2057, what more can Lititz achieve?
Role of the Master Plan
The role of a Downtown Master Plan is to develop an understanding of existing patterns of development and growth potential. Two considerations are key:
? Physical elements: These physical elements include building mass, space allocations, and connections.
? Community use: These potential uses include the types of services needed by the residents of the community.
Then, looking beyond the existing physical elements and community uses of today, the Master Plan lays out a specific vision for the future.
Process
The process used to develop this plan included:
Collection of Printed Data - assembling and summarizing pertinent information to reaffirm economic and market potential, including:

Study Area Description
The study area for this Downtown Master Plan
is bounded to the north by Lincoln Avenue and
Kleine Lane, to the south by Orange Street and
Juniper Lane, to the east by Cherry Lane, and to
the west by Pine Lane.
Within the study area (see Figure 2), the following
physical elements were examined and analyzed to
set a framework for the planning process:
? Existing Land Use
? Existing Building Area
? Existing Parking
? Existing Land Cover
? Existing Infrastructure
Figure 2 - The Master Plan study area
Existing Land Use Map
Within each downtown building, there are multiple
floors with multiple tenants and uses. For the purpose
of this Master Plan, the review focused on the first
and second floor spaces. Office space occupies almost
33% of the first floor in the downtown buildings. By
including government and institutional uses, the
number increases to 43%. Retail establishments occupy
15% of the space. In the second floor spaces, residential
space is the dominant use, accounting for 42%, with
office space at 29%.

Existing Parking
Throughout the study area, on-street parking is
provided by Borough-managed meters (the rate is
$ .25/hour). Most businesses provide employee
and limited consumer parking on surface lots
behind their buildings. There is one private,
two-level parking deck in town, which services

provided to accommodate the projected population growth within the Borough of Lititz between 2007 and 2012. Approximately 576 housing units will be required to accommodate the projected population growth within a three-mile radius of the Borough.
? Household income within the Borough mirrors the state median, however income within a three- mile radius is 25% higher than in Pennsylvania.
Figure 6 - Existing Land Cover in the study area
An area of approximately 17 acres within the 67- acre study area is designated as 100 year floodplain by FEMA. Approximately 9 acres is mapped as floodway, an area that carries the majority of the storm flow and should remain unobstructed.
Existing Utility Review
Currently, there are no problems with the water or sewer systems downtown. The sewer system is
comprised of all 8 mains and there are no capacity or surcharge issues.
The water main in Main Street is 12 which is one of the larger mains in town. In the study area, the portion of the water main in Broad Street is 8.
There have been no capacity or pressure problems anywhere in this area.
Currently, there is capacity in the system to accommodate increased demand through expansion and redevelopment.
Demographic Summary
The basis for the demographic information is data for Lititz Borough, a three-mile radius around the center point in the borough, and a five-mile radius from this same center point, as shown in Figure 8. Summary demographic data is presented here. For the numbers behind the summary, please see the Appendix.
? Population growth rate in Lititz is slightly higher than the rate of growth for the state of Pennsylvania, but the growth rate within a three- mile radius is more than double the state growth rate. Similar growth is expected to continue.
? Based on this growth rate, approximately 152 additional housing units of various styles can be
? According to 2007 demographic estimates, the most affluent neighborhoods are approximately three miles south of the Borough of Lititz, with average annual household incomes of up to
$165,000.
? Nearly 27% of residents within three miles of Lititz have attained a bachelors or graduate degree, compared to 22% of all Pennsylvanians.
Market Study Summary
Data on spending patterns of those who live within these same geographic limits (the Borough, three- mile radius, and five-mile radius) was collected
in order to identify existing spending patterns and identify what spending might be captured in downtown Lititz.
Figure 9 shows data on sales surplus areas and sales leakage areas. A sales surplus (shown in black) indicates that retailers are exporting goods to consumers from outside the area. A sales leakage (shown in red) indicates that consumers

that live in a defined area are spending disposable income outside the area. The data reflects total spending and does not consider where the dollars were spent, just where the consumers live. This data indicates:
? Lititz Borough residents spend an estimated $87.5 million annually for retail goods and services. Those who live within a three-mile radius spend
$279 million annually, and those who live in the five-mile radius spent $716.7 million annually.
? Lititz Borough residents spend an estimated $11.5 million annually for food away from home (e.g. eating out). Within a three-mile radius, residents spend $35.8 million annually, and $119.3 million within a five-mile radius.
? Within a three-mile radius of Lititz, spending patterns and local sales estimates indicate an opportunity for additional clothing and accessory stores, eating/drinking places, and performing arts venues.
? Data indicates that the area is an exporter of furniture and home furnishings and miscellaneous

retail merchandise, which reflects the unique retail shops found in downtown Lititz. These are potential clusters that could be built upon.
? New downtown development should focus on the local market. Heritage tourists are typically looking for a local experience. If downtown Lititz businesses truly reflect the character of local residents, they will also be attractive to tourists.
In addition to residents and tourists, Lititz is also host to a healthy workforce of approximately 6,000 workers. Using national averages and raw local data, day time work force spending can be estimated and is shown in Figure 10.

Guiding Principles
The Master Plan will enhance the offerings of downtown Lititz through redevelopment of properties without adversely affecting the current business structure.
Our three over-arching goals are:
Expand social, cultural, and retail offerings for residents while accommodating visitors and tourists
Lititz is a real, functioning community and the Master Plan will sustain this by focusing on the needs of the residents, both present and future, first.
Currently, 18% of the available land in the borough is not taxable. The Borough is fortunate to have schools, churches, and civic enterprises to add to the richness of our town, but it is important to offset this situation by creating an increased tax base in order to continue to provide quality services to our residents.
Although the downtown core appears to be well- ordered and built-out, taking a step back in history brings the realization that downtown Lititz today is vastly different than 100, 75, 50, or even 25 years ago. In some cases, critical building mass has been lost and with it, the feel of a completely continuous streetscape and downtown experience. The planning process should look to our past to create a healthy and viable future. And in the case of physical development, that means filling in the holes and maximizing the use of our available space.
With this reference point in mind, there is room to enhance and grow to meet the current and anticipated needs of the Lititz community, within the existing context of the downtown. It is the missed and under- utilized opportunities that are the focus of this Master Plan.

Downtown Lititz Master Plan

Integrate the Lititz Run corridor and other civic spaces into the connected fabric of the downtown
Lititz Springs Park has long been the jewel of the Lititz community. However, although the park is adjacent to the downtown, daily activties that
occur in the park are usually not an integral part of the downtown experience.
Lititz Run  which runs through the middle of the community  is considered an asset, but little has been done to celebrate its existence. Many locations have even turned their back on it and added to its degradation.
Therefore, a key element of this master plan is to realize the prominence of our current open space and natural assets and weave them into the fabric of the thriving downtown so that each supports the other and their boundaries are
indistinguishable. At the same time, it is important to protect our natural assets and resources. This can be accomplished through sustainable and green design practices.
Regarding other connections, Lititz is already a walkable community. A continuous streetscape treatment that creates a system of walkways and circuits will enhance walkability even more.
Alleys should assume their rightful position as service providers to the businesses fronting on the main streets, but the alleys should also be enhanced to add visual quality to the downtown and provide a clean, safe, and green pedestrian route.
Figure 11 - Integrating the Lititz Run corridor is a guiding Master Plan principle
3. Establish a parking strategy
Parking, or room for surface parking, is currently a major limitation for expansion of the downtown. Creating adequate parking will require new methods to meet the expanded need. There is no more land area to pave over in the downtown and, even if there was space available, more surface parking is not the appropriate approach.

Master Plan
The strategies set forth in the Downtown Lititz Master Plan fulfill the intent of the guiding principles, as outlined here.
1. Expand the social, cultural, and retail offerings for residents
while accommodating visitors and tourists
? Establish a mixed use district for the entire study
area
? Increase density of buildings and uses in the core district of the study area
- Redevelop underutilized facilities
- Reserve the 1st floor for retail uses
- Encourage in-fill
- Redevelop properties along Lititz Run and the rail line, including the Susquehanna Bank property and the Long and Bomberger property
- Remove parking from the flood way
? Look to our past and the committment to preserve the buildings that give the community its character. Historic preservation is an important component of any effort to promote sustainable development. The conservation and improvement
of our existing built resources - including adaptive re-use of historic and older buildings, greening the existing building stock, and reinvestment in our historic community - is crucial.
? Further from the core district, reduce density of buildings and intensity of use
? Capitalize on the existing street and alley patterns to strengthen circulation and massing of buildings
? Re-establish the alley network for service access and pedestrian travel
? Expand housing opportunities within the study
area
- Add housing to upper floors throughout
- Provide a variety of housing types and living units
? Celebrate and integrate the arts within the fabric of the downtown: sculpture/art, music, and entertainment
2. Integrate the Lititz Run corridor and other civic spaces into the connected fabric of the downtown
? Provide a hierarchy of green space, open space, and pedestrian routes throughout the downtown
- Maintain Lititz Springs Park as the largest green and civic space in the downtown
- Develop the Lititz Run corridor as a linear green space for passive and active recreation
- Extend pathway or walk system along the corridor for connection to existing trails in the community
- Create a new, more structured open space on the Long and Bomberger property
- Add outdoor dining, seating, window boxes, and container plantings to extend the park-like feel throughout the downtown as well as green and soften the hardscape of the core district
- Front buildings along the stream and provide visual access to Lititz Run
? Encourage sustainable design practices including the use of green roofs, green alleys, green surface parking, and pervious paving as well as other best management practices
3. Establish a parking strategy
? Develop opportunities for shared parking
? Consolidate existing parking areas to the rear of buildings on Main and Broad Streets, making use of the existing alley network
? Locate a parking structure to the rear of the Parkview Hotel along North Lane

Focus Areas
Central Business District
Main Street, from Broad to Cedar, is the heart of the downtown, and as a result, should be enhanced and strengthened to assume the role. Most would recognize this particular part of downtown as
the central business district, characterized by two and three story buildings. The first floors of
many of these structures are currently occupied by retail uses while the upper floors are occupied by residential or office space.
The plan expands the existing Main Street retail/ business base by activating the Lititz Run Corridor (Broad to Cedar). In addition, retail uses should
be introduced into this area that tie back to Main Street, specifically through enhanced offerings on
Figure 16 - Plan view of the Central Business District
Figure 17 - Zum Anker Alley, today
Figure 18 - Making use of the Zum Anker Alley for outside dining affords opportunity to connect with the street and enhance the social aspects of the downtown.
Broad Street and Sturgis Lane. Increased business frontage along each of these streets will serve as connectors and further frame the limits of the central business district.
To further connect all points of the downtown, additional built space will occur along Sturgis Lane from Main Street to Lititz Run, and along Kleine Lane. By using the alleys to add new construction, the historic core remains intact, while adding necessary density to the area. Additionally, the new buildings may be constructed integrally with a multi-story parking structure which, by location, will serve the surrounding mixed-use developments.
Downtown Lititz Master Plan
1210
Focus Areas
Increased density will be made possible by providing a parking structure of three to five levels off North Lane that matches the building heights of Main Street. The existence of this new structure will allow many of the existing surface lots to be removed and redeveloped for enhanced green space and new business space.
East on Main Street
Heading further east on Main Street, the area from Cedar Street to Cherry Lane includes many properties that are very residential in scale and
architectural style. In order to focus the majority of new business and retail space in the core business district, this area should remain predominantly residential but could include a limited mix
of convenience and service retail to serve the surrounding neighborhood as well as limited hospitality, entertainment, and office uses.

Adaptive reuse of the existing structures could also provide additional retail and business space adjacent to the heritage tourist activities in the area (Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery, Moravian Church, and Lititz Museum).
South Broad Street
Currently viewed as part of our core downtown, the area of South Broad Street from Juniper Lane to Orange Street has struggled to establish a true identity. Immediately adjacent to the successful Main Street, the general architecture on the west side of Broad Street includes grand historic homes while the architecture on the east side includes townhouse/row home styles. The street has retained a mix of professional offices,

limited specialty retail as well as some service and hospitality-retail integrated with the residential uses. The sporadic nature of the uses on Broad Street has limited the overall success of the street as a specialty retail corridor. Most first floor uses are office-oriented or retail establishments. Upper floors are occupied by both residential and office spaces.

volumes, South Broad Street should include a mix of convenience and service retail, office/ professional space, galleries, hospitality, and residential offerings. Small restaurants with outdoor seating on front porches or patios or bed and breakfast establishments fit the grand homes and could fill the buildings comfortably.
Figure 27 - The area east of Lititz Run on N. Broad Street
Figure 28 - A massing diagram of the existing conditions
shown in the photo above
Figure 29 - A massing diagram illustrating the future potential for this area.
Service and hospitality retail that relies on high traffic volume can also succeed in this area. Office and professional space should be relegated to the upper floors, where feasible.
North Broad Street
The area of North Broad Street from Kleine Lane to Lincoln Avenue provides a linkage and entry point to the downtown along the busy route 501 corridor. The building stock is an eclectic mix of row homes and small commercial structures that house a mix of food service establishments as well as some limited specialty retail. This part of North Broad Street is at times considered an island detached from the core of the downtown due to numerous visual obstructions  the rail line and several large parking areas as well as breaks in the architectural façade and uses.
As with South Broad Street, based on high traffic volumes, a mix of convenience and service retail, restaurants, and residential units can be created in this area, with services provided for local residents and the workforce of downtown. Providing infill development will strengthen the existing retail identity while linking this area to the central business district.

KREADY
PROPERTY
Focus Areas
A Dynamic New Residential Neighborhood
Research based on current growth rates has indicated that an additional 152 new housing units could be supported in the Borough of Lititz over the next five (5) years. This area of the plan, from Cedar to Water Street and North Lane to Kleine Lane, is nearer to the existing residential fabric and therefore has a unique spatial identity. Currently a large portion of this area is occupied by surface parking and the rail line. To capitalize on the proximity and value of the Lititz Run and the adjacent residential neighborhoods, the plan proposes to accommodate the potential growth with a maximum of 225 units, creating a dynamic new neighborhood.
Limited mixed-use development along the existing street frontage is also encouraged. In addition,
the plan continues to incorporate parks and civic spaces in this zone.
The Kready property, located at the edge of the study area, should be developed as a destination hospitality venue or a condo-style residential property. In either case, redeveloping this property in this manner will provide a necessary link between the residential fabric, the heritage tourism destinations in the area, and ultimately the central business district.

From a vantage point above Lititz, you can see how the Vision, Guiding Principles, and Master Plan strategies take shape. Working from left to right across this transformation sketch:
? The northern edge is further defined with additional building and lease-able space that helps to tie the North Broad Street businesses into the core.
? Streamlining vehicular access at this point on Broad Street to an enter-only arrangement reduces the congestion on Broad Street and allows exiting to occur at a consolidated and safe location on Front Street or Cedar Street.
? A new civic space in front of the current Freeze and Frizz Restaurant captures activity along Broad Street and serves as the entry piece to an enhanced greenway and pedestrian connection from Wilbur Chocolate and along Lititz Run.
? To the east on the Bomberger Property, additional buildings are arranged facing the Lititz Run Corridor. These buildings, as shown, are three- and four-story with retail on the first floors and office and residential on the upper floors.

? Asphalt parking areas are removed from the banks of Lititz Run. The floodway is developed as a natural greenway with pathways linking the greater community to the downtown. This network also provides an important connection of new retail along the Run to the North Broad Street corridor and the Main Street corridor.
? The new parking structure (see sketch on page 17) shown to the far right of the aerial is critical to increase available parking spaces while also allowing removal of existing surface lots within the floodway. As shown in Figures 12 and 13, parking structures do not need to look like eyesores. They can include retail space on the exterior ground floor or be woven into the fabric of the downtown through architectural treatments matching the style of the community.
? Throughout the Lititz Run corridor, asphalt should be removed and these spaces transformed into green space that engages the architectural edge.

Parking Enhancements
Short term parking strategies should provide a framework for shared parking agreements.
Smaller lots should be combined into consolidated, larger lots to gain effciency of use and circulation. Landscaping and buffering should be added to these consolidated lots for aesthetic appeal and to support sustainable design practices.
Two examples of lot consolidation appear here in Figures 43 and 44. As presented in the Master Plan, each lot now contains a more logical parking layout and serves multiple retail or office enterprises.
In addition, by using consolidated lots, we gain
parking. The existing layout behind the businesses

on Main Street yields 80 spaces. With consolidation, the area yields 100 parking spaces.
The existing layout to the rear of the businesses on
S. Broad Street yields 32 spaces. With consolidation, the same area yields 90 parking spaces.
The long-term parking solution involves providing vertical parking structures to consolidate parking and free up land for building or green space.

Surrounded by Lancaster County farmland and the still- present influence of the Amish, Lititz stands apart as a community that offers something a little different.A more sophisticated retail setting in a comfortable and walkable downtown environment creates a desirable town that is the envy of all who are lucky enough to visit.
ANATOMY
Lititz is located in beautiful Lancaster County, at the crossroads of two state highways - routes 501 and 772 which, in town, are know as Broad Street and Main Street, respectively. Walking is the best way to get around and experience everything - shops, architecture, alleyways, side streets, the park, and the people.
PEOPLE
Although the median age of the residents of Lititz is 39, the average is more
reflective of the large population of retirees and children at opposite ends of the age scale than a large group of thirty- or forty- somethings.
TYPICAL CITIZEN
Those who live in Lititz have an innate love of this town. Although the town was settled as a closed Moravian community, Lititz now is home to an increasingly diverse group of well-educated, up-and- coming families and others who find great appeal in this walkable community
where you actually know your neighbors.
DEFINING EXPERIENCE
Take part in the longest continually running 4th of July celebration in the
United States, established in 1818. Musical performances, dance routines, fun, games, and of course, food, all lead up to the Queen of Candles crowning in the Park with over 7,000 candles lining Lititz Run and a spectacular fireworks display set to music - be sure to reserve your spot early!

URBAN MYTH
In 1857, J.Augustus Beck added a carved lions head to Lititz Springs Park and is still present today. His original plan was to incise all of the head, the shoulders and the forepaws of the king of the beasts. However, because
of the extreme hardness of the rock, which ruined his chisels, he had to abandon his original plans. (Lititz 250, A Historical Anthology)
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
Margaret Mead
