installation, maintenance and use of police and fire alarms that provide
repetitious false alarms.

As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
POLICE ALARM  Includes alarms commonly referred to as "burglar
alarms" and "holdup alarms."

The use of police or fire alarms, whether audible or direct-line type of
alarms, are expressly permitted subject to the following conditions:
A. Direct-line radio or other electronic police or fire alarms shall be
installed by competent workmen so that such devices shall not emit
false alarms.
B. Any alarm system that produces false alarms shall constitute a public
nuisance if such system activates more than one false alarm in any
thirty-day period, two false alarms in any ninety-day period, three false
alarms in any one-hundred-eighty-day period or four false alarms in any
three-hundred-sixty-five-day period.
C. Any police officer or fire fighter who responds to a false alarm shall
report the same to the Commissioner of Police who shall monitor and
maintain records concerning such false alarms.
D. When any alarm system shall constitute a public nuisance as set forth
hereunder, the Commissioner of Police shall notify the owner of the
system that it has activated more false alarms than is permissible
hereunder and that any future false alarms shall result in the
prosecution for violation of this article.
E. Notice as required by this article shall be given by the Commissioner of
Police by mailing a certified letter with return receipt requested or by
personal service of such notice by handing a copy of the same to the
owner of the subject property or to an adult representative thereof. If

has previously been declared a public nuisance as provided herein. If any
false alarm shall be given by such system following the date of receipt of

workmen or repairmen in the field that such system was defective and such
deficiency has been corrected. Upon filing of such affidavit with appropriate
exhibits, the false alarm history concerning the premises shall be
considered void and of no legal effect.

of negligent use and a defective system, in order to terminate the finding
that the system is a public nuisance, an owner shall comply with the
provisions of § 59-6 and, in addition, file an affidavit explaining the steps
that have been taken to correct the negligent use which has resulted in
false alarms. Upon acceptance of such affidavits by the Commissioner of
Police, the declaration of the alarm system as a public nuisance shall be

Commissioner of Police before it may be utilized.
§ 59-9. Permission to install.
Any permission to install a police or fire alarm system granted by the
Commissioner of Police shall be predicated upon the specific condition
that should such system prove to constitute a public nuisance as defined
hereunder, then the alarm system shall be terminated also as provided
herein.
§ 59-10. False alarm response charge.
Any owner of a police alarm, fire alarm, smoke detector or other type of
alarm, and which alarm has a direct or indirect connection which calls
for a response from the Police or Fire Department, shall be charged a
response charge as set forth from time to time by resolution of the Board
of Supervisors for each false alarm after the third false alarm responded
to by the Police or Fire Departments within a calendar year. Failure to pay
the response charge within 30 days of written notice from the responding
department shall result in prosecution as prescribed in § 59-11.
§ 59-11. Violations and penalties.

offense. Each section of this article that is violated shall also constitute
a separate offense.
B. In any case where the Commissioner of Police has declared an alarm
system to be a public nuisance, the Solicitor may bring legal
proceedings in equity or otherwise to prohibit the continued use of such
system and to collect any and all damages on behalf of the Township
resulting from the use of such system.

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 108-18. Identification.
§ 108-19. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Lower Paxton
Township classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated August 2, 2012, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Lower Paxton Township and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. Floodway Area.
(1) Description: the area identified as Floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by
more than one foot at any point. This term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other available
studies or sources of information for those special floodplain areas
where no floodway has been identified in the FIS.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood
heights shall be prohibited.
(b) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection's regional office.
B. Special Floodplain Area.
(1) Description: the areas identified as Zones AE and A1-30 in the FIS
which are subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods and have base flood
elevations (BFEs) shown.
(2) Special requirements:
§ 108-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108-19
1:75
(a) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse.
(b) In special floodplain areas without a designated floodway, no
new development shall be permitted unless it can be
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and
projected development will not increase the BFE by more than
one foot.
C. Approximate Floodplain Area.
(1) Description: the areas identified as Zone A in the FIS which are
subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event
determined using approximate methodologies. Because detailed
hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no BFEs or flood
depths are shown.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse.
(b) When available, information from other federal, state, and
other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the BFE,
as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the BFE shall be determined by using
a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which
is nearest the construction site in question.
(3) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by Lower Paxton Township.
D. Shallow Flooding Area.
(1) Description: the areas identified as Zones AO and AH in the FIS.
These areas are subject to inundation by one-percent annual
chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one
and three feet.
(2) Special requirements. Establish drainage paths to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
§ 108-19 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 108-20
1:76
§ 108-20. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 108-21. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by Lower Paxton Township Planning
Commission, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may
appeal to the Board of Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant.

within the Township, containing the information required by this chapter.
§ 152-5. Registration of defaulted mortgage real property.
A. Any mortgagee who holds a mortgage on real property located within

determine vacancy or occupancy, upon default by the mortgagor. The
mortgagee shall, within 10 days of the inspection, register the property
with the Code Enforcement Department, or its designee, on forms or
other manner as directed, and indicate whether the property is vacant
or occupied. A separate registration is required for each property,
whether it is found to be vacant or occupied.
B. Registration pursuant to this section shall contain the name, direct
mailing address, a direct contact name, telephone number, and e-mail
address for the mortgagee/trustee, and the mortgage servicer, and the

the responsibility of paying all previous unpaid fees and fines,
regardless of who the mortgagee was at the time when registration was
required, including but not limited to unregistered periods during the
foreclosure process. The provisions of this section are cumulative with
and in addition to other available remedies.
§ 152-3 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 152-5
1:146
E. If the servicing rights for a mortgage on a registrable property are sold
or transferred, the registration must be updated to include all the new
servicer information within 10 days of the servicing transfer.
F. Any previous unpaid registration fees are the responsibility of the new
registrable property owner and are due and payable with their initial
registration. Except if it is determined that the transferee is exempt
from paying fees then the previous mortgagee will not be released from
the responsibility of paying all previous unpaid fees and fines,
regardless of who the mortgagee was at the time when registration was
required, including but not limited to unregistered periods during the
foreclosure process. The provisions of this section are cumulative with
and in addition to other available remedies.
G. As long as the property is registrable it shall be inspected by the
mortgagee, or designee, monthly. If an inspection shows a change in the
property's occupancy status the mortgagee shall, within 10 days of that
inspection, update the occupancy status of the property registration.
H. A nonrefundable semiannual registration fee of $300 shall accompany
each registration pursuant to this section.
I. If a lis pendens, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other public notice of
foreclosure is filed on a property and the property was not registered
and the registration fee paid at least 30 days prior to the filing date, a
late fee shall be charged. The late fee shall be the equivalent to 10% of
the registration fee and shall be charged for every 30 days period, or
portion thereof, the property is not registered and shall be due and
payable with the registration. This section shall apply to the initial
registration and thirty-day delinquent registration renewals.
Registrations delinquent greater than 30 days are also subject to
additional fines as described herein.

servicer, or owner. Third-party registration fees are not allowed without
the consent of Lower Paxton Township and/or its authorized designee.
K. Properties subject to this section shall remain under the semiannual
registration requirement, and the inspection, security and maintenance
standards of this section as long as they are registrable.
L. Until the mortgage or lien on the property in question is satisfied, or
legally discharged, the desire to no longer pursue foreclosure, the filing
of a dismissal of lis pendens and/or summary of final judgment and/or
certificate of title, voluntary or otherwise, does not exempt any
mortgagee holding the defaulted mortgage, from all the requirements
of this chapter as long as the borrower is in default.
M. Any person or legal entity that has registered a property under this
section must report any change of information contained in the
registration within 10 days of the change.

Table II below should be used as a guide in the general design of a tile
disposal field.
Table II
Drain Fields
Minimum diameter of tile 4 inches
Minimum number of lines per field 3 inches
Maximum length of each line 75 feet
Minimum trench width 18 inches
Maximum trench width 36 inches
Preferred depth of lines 18 inches
Maximum depth of lines 24 inches
Maximum grade of lines 4 inches per 75 feet
Minimum space between trenches 6 feet
Minimum filter material beneath tile 8 inches
Minimum filter material over tile 3 inches
Minimum lengths of Drain Fields
500 gallon septic tank 200 linear feet
750 gallon septic tank 270 linear feet
A. The tile disposal field should be designed to provide proper distribution
of the sewage effluent throughout the entire field. Sufficient laterals
must be installed to provide the necessary absorption area and to
prevent overloading any single line. Each field lateral line should be
connected separately to the distribution box, should never be
subdivided and must be of equal length in order to maintain a wellbalanced
system.
B. The tile line must be laid one to a trench with one-fourth-inch open
joints and surrounded by clean gravel, crushed stone or slag, ranging in
size from 1/2 inch to 21/2 inches. Tar paper strips must be placed over
the joints to prevent fine materials from being carried into the lines.
However, if the filter material is graded and washed, the tar paper
strips are not necessary. A piece of untreated building paper, heavy
wrapping paper or a layer of straw must be placed over the filter
material before backfilling with earth.
C. Drain field ditches must be dug level. If steps are necessary because of
sloping terrain, steps must be made with crushed stone or clean gravel.

§ 162-4 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 162-6
1:208
§ 162-7. Cutting and removal of trees.
The Shade Tree Commission may, upon 30 days' written notice, require an
abutting property owner to have cut and remove tree(s) within the rightof-
way afflicted with any disease or infested with any insect that threatens
to injure or destroy shade trees in the Township. Upon failure of any such
owner to comply with such notice, the Township may undertake the work
to be done and collect the costs thereof from the owner of the abutting
property. Removal by the property owner of nondiseased trees or those not
infested by insects shall not be permitted within the right-of-way unless, in
the judgment of the Shade Tree Commission, one or more of the following
criteria exist:
not to create a safety or liability problem for motorists, pedestrian
traffic or other activities within the right-of-way. The Township may
require that the cost of tree planting, transplanting, trimming and
removal of street trees in the tree lawns be paid by the owner of the
real estate abutting the street where the work is to be done. In areas
where tree lawns exist, the setback for tree planting shall be at a point
halfway between the curb and sidewalk. However, no tree(s) shall be
planted in a tree lawn within the line of sight.
B. In rural or undeveloped areas where sidewalks and curb are not
present, the right-of-way may vary in width but does exist. The abutting
property owner shall be responsible for trees and other vegetation
growing in the area between the edge of the cartway and the right-ofway
line in such rural or undeveloped areas. Trees in these areas shall
be pruned to conform with §§ 162-8 and 162-9. Where no curbing exists,
the setback for tree planting shall be eight feet from the edge of the
cartway. However, no tree(s) shall be planted within the line of sight.
C. All trees and other vegetation within the Township right-of-way must be
pruned or trimmed in a manner to allow for full visibility of street
signage and the minimum required line of sight.
A. A tree will sustain substantial damage due to the installation or repair
of underground utilities where no other alternative, such as tunneling,
sleeving or relocation, exists.
B. A tree is causing traffic safety problems and pruning or other less
invasive techniques would not eliminate the problems.
C. A tree has caused substantial sidewalk and/or curb damage and repair
or replacement of the sidewalk and/or curb would inflict serious root
damage to the tree.
D. The maintenance of overhead utilities would require that a tree be
severely pruned resulting in the removal of 2/3 or more of the crown
thereby causing irreparable damage to the tree.
§ 162-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 162-8
1:209
§ 162-8. Manner of trimming or pruning.
All trimming and pruning of shade trees shall be done in a manner to ensure
natural growth of such tree and a natural appearance, in accordance with
national pruning standards. Pollarding or topping of trees (removal of 2/3
or more of the crown) is specifically prohibited.
§ 162-9. Clearance of trees over sidewalks and streets.
All branches of shade trees shall be kept trimmed in a manner to maintain
a minimum height of 12 feet where they overhang a street and eight
feet where they overhang a sidewalk. All shade trees standing on private
property and having branches overhanging sidewalks or streets shall also
be kept pruned by the owner so the lowest branches are in compliance with
this section. In the event that the property owner neglects or refuses to
maintain trees at the prescribed level within the time specified as notified
in writing, the Township may perform such work at owner's expense, in the
same manner as otherwise specified in this chapter.
§ 162-10. Removal of fallen trees and parts of trees.
In the event that a shade tree or its parts are felled by storm or other
accident, the fallen tree and/or its felled parts shall be removed from the
cartway of the street by the Township without charge. Property owners shall
be responsible for any other removal or cleanup outside of the cartway of
the fallen tree and/or its felled parts.
§ 162-11. Repair or replacement of damaged trees.
In the event that a shade tree is damaged, the Township may charge for
repairs or replacement or make a charge for the appraised value of the tree
against the person responsible for the damage of said tree.
§ 162-12. Removal of tree stumps.
After removal of a tree, the remaining stump shall be removed by the
abutting property owner to a point not less than six inches below the grade
of the surrounding area. If a replacement tree is to be planted at the same
location, the stump will be removed to accommodate the replacement tree.
§ 162-13. Branches not to obstruct streetlights.
The property owner shall trim or cause to be trimmed any tree branches
so that they do not obstruct light from streetlights. In the event that said
work is performed by the Township, the abutting property owner may be
responsible for the expense as otherwise specified in this chapter.
§ 162-14. Hazardous shade trees and branches.
Where hazardous shade trees or dead branches overhang the right-ofway
of a street or otherwise exist within the right-of-way, the Shade Tree
§ 162-8 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 162-14
1:210
Commission may require the abutting property owner to cause them to be
removed at their expense so as to maintain public safety within the rightof-
way. In the event of an emergency or imminent hazardous situation, the
Shade Tree Commission may require that the tree(s) be removed within 24
hours or less.
§ 162-15. Replacement trees.
As a condition to any request to remove any shade tree, the Shade Tree
Commission may require that the property owner, at their own expense,
plant another tree in place of the one removed and, in such case, direct
the type, size and location of the tree to be planted and the season within
which the work shall be done. A replacement tree shall be planted within
six months of removal of the previous tree and the Shade Tree Commission
should be notified when the work is completed so the file may be closed.
§ 162-16. Spacing and location of trees.
Spacing between newly planted shade trees shall not be less than 25 feet
nor more than 40 feet and may vary with species of tree(s) being planted.
In addition to the restrictions established under § 162-6 of this chapter, no
shade tree shall be planted less than 15 feet from a fire hydrant, or light
standard.
§ 162-17. Size specifications for tree replacement.
Tree replacement size shall be measured at a point six inches above
planting level. All trees shall be of 1/2 inch to two inches in caliper at this
point and shall have no branches below a height of five feet measured from
ground level.
§ 162-18. Planting under existing utility lines.
All trees planted under overhead utilities shall be a species which will not
obstruct or have the potential to grow into or come into contact with the
wires. They shall be small trees or medium trees according to utility height
and shall be specified by the Shade Tree Commission.
§ 162-19. Root zone controls.
The Commission may in some cases require root control devises or material
to minimize the effect of root growth on sidewalks, curbs or underground
utilities. The need and type of control shall be prescribed by the
Commission where necessary.
§ 162-20. Unnecessary harm to trees prohibited.
No person shall break, injure, mutilate, kill or destroy any shade tree or set
fire to or permit fire to burn any shade tree. No person shall allow any toxic
chemical, liquid or solid, to empty, drain, or seep onto shade trees or their

All tree maintenance contractors who trim, remove or otherwise maintain
trees located within the Township right-of-way shall possess general liability
insurance coverage with a policy limit of not less than $500,000 for each
occurrence.
§ 162-22. Exceptions permitted.
The Shade Tree Commission shall have the power in appropriate cases
to permit deviations from strict compliance with this chapter whenever,
due to special circumstances, literal enforcement of this chapter would be
impossible, impractical, or not in the best interest of the Township or the
trees.
§ 162-23. Collection of costs for work done by Township.
Payment of costs for work done by the Township shall be due and payable
30 days after proper invoice by the Township to the property owner. If the
property owner does not make payment within 30 days, said costs shall be
considered as an assessment to the property and the Township Solicitor
shall file a lien against the property to ensure payment as may be provided
by law.
§ 162-24. Authorized species of trees.
The planting of any species of tree within Township right-of-way other
than those approved by the Shade Tree Commission is prohibited. A list of
approved trees shall be maintained by the Commission and made available
to the public through the Township Office. Any person desiring to plant a
tree(s) species that does not appear on the list, within the Township rightof-
way, shall make application to the Shade Tree Commission for approval
of the desired species.
§ 162-25. Township maintenance.

result in waste not being picked up. Location for collection of
uncontainerized recyclable material shall be as specified by the
Township. Location of bulk containers at multifamily
establishments shall be in accordance with Subsection C(2) below.
(3) Time limitation. Waste and recyclable containers are not permitted
to be stored in the location provided in Subsection B(2) outside of
the scheduled pick-up days. This time limitation applies to the
keeping/storing of compost bags/cans. Waste and recycling shall
not be placed at the curb more than eight hours before the
scheduled pick-up day and must be removed from the right-of-way
within eight hours after pick-up. This time may be extended at the
Townships discretion.
C. Storage on commercial, institutional and industrial properties.
(1) Containers. Storage of municipal waste on commercial,
institutional and industrial properties shall be done in the same
§ 165-12 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 165-12
1:222
type of containers as required for residential properties except
where the accumulation of solid waste for such commercial,
institutional or industrial property precludes their use, in which
case such owner or occupant shall make special arrangements
with the authorized collector for the storing of such additional
quantities. Special arrangement shall include the number and type
of special bulk container(s) to be furnished by the collector as may
be approved by the Township.
(2) Location of containers. Containers for collection at commercial,
institutional or industrial properties shall be located on the owner's
or occupant's premises at a place agreed upon by the owner or
occupant of the commercial, institutional or industrial property and
the authorized collector, and shall be satisfactory to the Township.
Such locations shall not interfere with public or private sidewalks,
walkways, driveways, roads, streets, highways, alleys or entrances
and exits of public or private buildings.
D. Authorization of municipal waste collectors and reporting
requirements. It shall be unlawful for any person or corporation, other
than persons or corporations authorized by license or contract by the
Township, to collect and/or transport municipal waste of any nature as a
regular hauling business within or from the Township. If the Township
decides to enter into an exclusive contract for the collection of
residential municipal waste in the Township, said contractor shall be
required to collect municipal waste in the Township exclusive of other
private haulers and collectors subject to exceptions to the exclusive
Township contract. The Township shall not issue a license to any private
hauler or collector for collection of residential municipal waste other
than the hauler or collector having the exclusive contract with the
Township. Authorization to collect, transport and dispose of municipal
waste for persons other than oneself may be given only by the Township
through the issuance of a contract or license. All applicants for
licensing shall be reviewed by the Township and shall be approved in
accordance with the following. (Municipal waste collection licenses or
contacts may be issued to only those persons or corporations who can
provide satisfactory evidence that they are capable of providing the
necessary services and can comply with the provisions and intent of the
article. The Township reserves the right to disapprove any application
for license.)
(1) Applicants for municipal waste collection license must furnish the
following information:
(a) The number of collection vehicles, the make, model, license
plate number and size of each vehicle to be used for the

Environmental Protection or other state government. However, the
Township reserves the right to designate a state-permitted facility of its
choice and require that all municipal waste generated in the Township
be disposed of at this designated facility. If the Township designates a
disposal facility as provided for above, all authorized (licensed)
collectors, or collectors operating under contract with the Township for
collection of municipal waste, shall be informed by the Township of the
location, regulations and other information pertaining to the designated
disposal facility. The Township reserves the right to make inspections of
authorized collectors to insure that waste generated within the
§ 165-12 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 165-12
1:224
Township is being disposed of in an authorized or designated facility
and to limit the use of a designated facility only to waste generated
within the Township. Any authorized collector found to be in violation
of this section shall have his license to collect or haul municipal waste
in the Township revoked.
G. Unlawful deposition of municipal waste. It shall be unlawful for any
person to deposit for collection any solid waste including bulky items
not generated at the address from which collection is made or to bring
any solid waste into the Township or from one address to another in the
Township for the purpose of taking advantage of the collection service
or to avoid the cost of collection.
H. Bulky waste. Bulky waste which is not collected by the normal or
weekly residential collection shall not be stored outside of a building or
accessory building on any land in the Township, except for a period not
exceeding 14 days pending the special handling for disposal of the
bulky waste. However, bush, tree trimmings, yard clipping, leaves,
grass or other waste from live plantings may be stored for longer
periods of time if necessary until the next scheduled collection for such
items or for the purpose of composting or burning such materials in
accordance with Township ordinances, unless such storage violates
other ordinances or regulations of the Township. It shall be unlawful for
any person to place bulky waste on any property other than on the
property at which it was generated or directly associated with. Bulky
waste shall be disposed of at a state-permitted or -licensed disposal
facility, a facility especially designated by the Township to take such
bulky Items or a legitimate salvage dealer that is in the business of
disposing or recycling such items.
I. Construction and demolition waste. All waste materials resulting from
the building structural alteration, repair, construction or demolition of
buildings or structures shall be disposed of as permitted by the
regulations of the State Department of Environmental Protection or
pertinent ordinances or regulations of the Township. It shall be the
responsibility of the property owner to ensure the disposal of such
waste in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
J. Exclusions.
(1) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit any person
not regularly engaged in the business of collection municipal waste
from hauling his own municipal waste on an irregular or
unscheduled basis to a state-permitted disposal facility or to the
disposal facility as designated by the Township in accordance with
the regulations of the disposal facility.
(2) Nothing contained herein shall prohibit a farmer from carrying out
normal farming operations, including composting or spreading of
manure or other farm-produced agricultural waste, not otherwise
prohibited or regulated for land application.
§ 165-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 165-12
1:225
§ 165-13. Service fees and billing.
(3) The provisions of this article do not apply to anything but the
storage, collections, transportation and disposal of municipal waste
and do not apply therefore, to hazardous or residual waste as
defined by the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act and its
amendments. All hazardous or residual waste must be disposed of
in compliance with applicable state and federal laws and
regulations.
K. Reporting requirements for commercial, institutional and industrial
establishments. Any commercial, institutional or industrial
establishment located within the Township that collects and transports
their own municipal waste, in other words, does not contract with a
licensed municipal waste hauler or come under the Township's
municipal waste contractor, shall submit an annual report to the
Township stating the amount of municipal waste generated by their
establishment. The reporting form shall be supplied by the Township to
the establishment and shall be returned to the Township within 30 days
of the end of each calendar year.
A. General. It shall be the duty and responsibility of every owner of
property and every person occupying a dwelling unit, premises or a
place of business within the Township where municipal waste is
produced and is accumulated to pay a service fee for the collection and
disposal of this waste, except as otherwise provided by this article, to a
licensed hauler, exclusive contractor or to the Township. A licensed
hauler, exclusive contractor or the Township may discontinue service
for nonpayment of service fees by a resident, commercial, institutional
or industrial establishment. Discontinuance of service due to
nonpayment of service fees shall not relieve the resident or
establishment from abiding by all of the requirements of this article.
B. Service charges to be based on volume of waste collected. To encourage
and maximize recycling, all municipal waste service charges for the
collection and disposal of municipal waste paid either to a licensed
hauler, an exclusive contractor or the Township shall be based upon the
volume of waste collected at the commercial, institutional or industrial
establishment. At residential units, service charges shall be based on
volume to the extent that any amount over four, thirty-six-gallon cans
per week be charged on a volume basis. To effectuate this provision, the
following guidelines are hereby established:
(1) The Township may require licensed haulers to disclose and allow
review by the Township of the solid waste rates being used by the
hauler if the Township has reason to believe the hauler is not
charging for solid waste services on a volume basis.
(2) An exclusive contract for the collection of residential municipal
waste as may be established by the Township shall include
provisions for billing residential units on a volume basis. This
§ 165-12 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 165-13
1:226
§ 165-14. Recyclables.
provision shall not preclude the Township or its contractors from
establishing a minimum charge for solid waste collection as an
assessment against the property for the benefit to the health and
welfare of the community for having a comprehensive solid waste
collection and recycling program available to the owners of
property in the Township. Such minimum charges will be set at
a level that is appropriate to cover the basic cost of solid waste
collection but shall not be set so high as to discourage recycling
solid waste.
C. Charges to be established by resolution. All service fees established
under an exclusive contract for the collection of waste by the Township
shall be established by a resolution to the Township Board of
Supervisors. Service charges so established shall be reviewed at least
annually and adjusted as necessary to ensure that all costs involved in
the collection and disposal of municipal waste under the exclusive
contract, including the administrative cost of the Township, are covered
by the service charges.
A. Introduction. The Township, recognizing that reclaiming of recyclable
materials is an important method for addressing the growing solid
waste disposal problem through conserving landfill space, and that
recycling conserves natural resources, reduces energy consumption
and promotes the general interest, and to be in compliance with the
Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste Reduction Act,13 does
hereby authorize and encourage collection, processing, storage,
transportation and recycling materials in accordance with the
provisions of this subpart.
B. General. Recyclables separated for the purpose of materials recovery
rather than disposal and collection by the Township or its designated
agent or contractor shall not be considered solid waste as defined
under this article and shall not be subject to the provisions of this
article which require the disposal of waste at designated facilities
unless such recyclables become unmarketable.
C. Establishment of program. The Township hereby establishes a program
for the mandatory separation of recyclables from municipal waste by
persons residing in single-family dwellings and multifamily
establishments, by commercial, institutional, and industrial
establishments, and by community events providers/sponsors/
promoters.
D. Items to be separated and recycled (this list may change from time to
time based on the recycling market):

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 170-101. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Lower Paxton Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance.
§ 170-102. Statement of findings.
The Board of Supervisors of Lower Paxton Township finds that:
§ 170-103. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote public health, safety, and welfare
within the Township and its watersheds by minimizing the harms and
maximizing the benefits through stormwater management provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood-reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases non-pointsource
pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment (that
may cause loss of natural infiltration or accelerated erosion) is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of
the people of the Township and all the people of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater program.
F. Implement an "illegal discharge detection and elimination program"
within MS4 permitted urbanized areas to address nonstormwater
discharges into the Township's separate storm sewer system.
§ 170-101 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-103
1:233
§ 170-104. Statutory authority.
A. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
B. Provide review procedures, performance standards, and design criteria
for watershed-wide stormwater planning and management.
C. Promote the utilization and preservation of existing natural drainage
systems.
D. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
E. Focus design and planning on infiltration of stormwater, to maintain
groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the
Township and the commonwealth.
G. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at Pennsylvania Code, Title 25. Environmental Protection,
Chapter 93.4a, to protect and maintain "existing uses" and maintain the
level of water quality to support those uses in all streams, and to
protect and maintain water quality in special-protection streams.
H. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
I. Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management best management practices (BMPs) that are
implemented in the Township.
J. Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES
permit requirements.
K. Implement an "illicit discharge detection and elimination program" to
address nonstormwater discharges that may enter into the Township's
separate storm sewer system.
L. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and permit
the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses.
M. Ensure the drainage of all low points along the streets and other
applicable areas and provide positive drainage away from all
structures.
A. The Township is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167),
32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended, the "Storm Water Management
Act."
B. The Township also is empowered to regulate land use activities that
affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, (Act
§ 170-103 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-104
1:234
§ 170-105. Applicability.
247), the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended by
Act 170 of December 21, 1988, and Act 131 of December 14, 1992.14
C. Chapter 102 of the Rules and Regulations of the Department of
Environmental Protection imposes requirements on earthmoving
activities which create accelerated erosion or a danger of accelerated
erosion and which require planning and implementation of effective soil
conservation measures.
A. This chapter shall apply to any "regulated activities" within the
Township and all stormwater runoff entering into the Township's
separate storm sewer system from lands within the boundaries of the
Township.
B. Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management
controls are also regulated under existing state law and implementing
regulations. This chapter shall operate in coordination with those
parallel requirements; the requirements of this chapter shall be no less
restrictive in meeting the purposes of this chapter than state law.
C. All earth disturbance activity and all subdivision and land development
applications duly filed under this chapter are defined as "regulated
activities" and shall be regulated by this chapter.
(1) "Regulated activities" are any earth disturbance activities or any
activities that involve the alteration or development of land in a
manner that may affect stormwater runoff. "Regulated activities"
include, but are not limited to, the following listed items:
(a) Earth disturbance activities.
(b) Land development.
(c) Subdivision.
(d) Construction of new or additional impervious or semipervious
surfaces.
(e) Construction of new buildings or additions to existing
buildings.
(f) Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream
channel.
(g) Installation of stormwater management facilities or
appurtenances thereto.
(h) Installation of stormwater BMPs.
(2) See § 170-302 of this chapter for exemption/modification criteria.

§ 170-106. Repealer.
Any ordinance, ordinance provision(s), or regulation of the Township
inconsistent with any of the provision(s) of this chapter is hereby repealed
to the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 170-107. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section(s) or
provision(s) of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity
of any of the remaining section(s) or provision(s) of this chapter.
§ 170-108. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken pursuant to this chapter do not relieve
the applicant of the responsibility to comply with or to secure required
permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable codes,
laws, rules, statutes, or ordinances. To the extent that this chapter imposes
more rigorous or stringent requirements for stormwater management, the
specific requirements contained in this chapter shall be followed.
§ 170-109. Duty of persons engaged in the development of land.
Notwithstanding any provision(s) of this chapter, including exemptions, any
landowner or any person engaged in the alteration or development of land
which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such
measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety,
or other property. Such measures also shall include actions as are required
to manage the rate, volume, direction, and quality of resulting stormwater
runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health, property,
and water quality.
§ 170-110. Township liability.
The degree of stormwater management sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the Township, any appointed or
elected official of the Township, the Dauphin County Conservation District,
or any officer, engineer, or employee thereof for any erosion, sedimentation,
or flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained, under
state regulations.
(1)
Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Earth

Water quality involves the chemical, biological, and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After earth disturbance
activities are complete, these characteristics can be impacted by
addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes in habitat
through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result of changes
in land surface area from those activities. Therefore, permanent
discharges to surface waters must be managed to protect the
stream bank, streambed, and structural integrity of the waterway,
to prevent these impacts.

(2) Maintain riparian and forested buffers.
(3) Limit grading and maintain nonerosive flow conditions in natural
flow paths.
(4) Maintain existing tree canopies near impervious areas.
(5) Minimize soil disturbance and reclaim disturbed areas with topsoil
and vegetation.
§ 170-301 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-302
1:264
(6) Direct runoff to pervious areas.
C. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed development/
additional impervious area will not adversely impact the following:
(1) Capacities of existing drainageways and storm sewer systems.
(2) Velocities and erosion.
(3) Quality of runoff if direct discharge is proposed.
(4) Existing known problem areas.
(5) Safe conveyance of the additional runoff.

E. The purpose of this section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning between local ordinances and NPDES permitting
(when required) and to ensure that the applicant has a single and clear
set of stormwater management standards to which the applicant is
subject. The Township may accept alternative stormwater management
controls, provided that:
(1) The applicant, in consultation with the Township, PADEP and/or
DCCD, states that meeting the requirements of the volume controls
or rate controls of this chapter is not possible or creates an undue
hardship.
(2) The alternative stormwater management controls, proposed by the
applicant, are documented to be acceptable to the Township,
§ 170-302 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-302
1:265
§ 170-303. Volume controls.
PADEP and/or DCCD for NPDES requirements pertaining to post
construction stormwater management requirements.
(3) The alternative stormwater management controls are in
compliance with all other sections of this chapter, including, but
not limited to, §§ 170-301D and 170-302A, B and C.
F. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from rate and
volume control requirements and SWM site plan preparation
requirement of this chapter, provided the activities are performed
according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 102. It should be
noted that temporary roadways are not exempt.
G. Agricultural activities are exempt from the requirements of this
chapter, provided the activities are performed according to the
requirements of 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 102.
H. Linear roadway improvement projects that create additional
impervious area are not exempt from the requirements of this chapter.
However, alternative stormwater management strategies may be
applied at the joint approval of the Township and the Dauphin County
Conservation District (if an NPDES permit is required) when site
limitations (such as limited right-of-way) and constraints (as shown and
provided by the applicant), preclude the ability of the applicant to meet
the enforcement of the stormwater management standards in this
chapter. All strategies must be consistent with PADEP's regulations,
including NPDES requirements.
I. The Township may, after an applicant has demonstrated compliance
with § 170-302A, B and C, grant a modification of the requirements of
one or more provisions of this chapter if the literal enforcement will
exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the
land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to
the public interest and that the purpose and intent of the Ordinance is
observed.
(1) All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall state in
full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on
which the request is based, the provision or provisions of the
Ordinance involved, and the minimum modification necessary.
A. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual
and in Appendix B of this chapter shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.15
B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method. For regulated activities
equal to or less than one acre, this chapter establishes no preference
15.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 170-302 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-303
1:266
for either method; therefore, the applicant may select either method
on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on
applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each
methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
[2] 20% of existing impervious area, when present on the
proposed project site, and contained within the new
proposed limit of disturbance, shall be considered meadow
(good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities shall be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff shall be infiltrated.
C. All applicable worksheets from Chapter 8 of the BMP Manual must be
used when establishing volume controls.
D. Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed elevation of
the stormwater BMPs are required when 5,000 square feet or greater of
new impervious surface is added. Infiltration test shall be conducted in
accordance with BMP Manual. The Township shall be notified 24 hours
prior to infiltration tests being conducted as to provide an opportunity
for the Township to witness the tests.

ARTICLE IV
Stormwater Management Standards
§ 170-401. Stormwater Management District Rate controls (release
rates).
A. Watersheds. Lower Paxton Township is divided into three watersheds,
including Paxton Creek, Spring Creek, and Beaver Creek (all contained
within the Dauphin County Act 167 Plan). The map indicating the
watershed boundaries is available for inspection at the Township office.
All areas within the districts are subject to the specified release rates.
The one-year, two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year and 100-year design
storms are all subject to the specified release rates.
B. Stormwater management districts.
(1) If the applicant can show that the post-development hydrograph
matches the predevelopment hydrograph for peak flows and
volume, for all design storms, then meeting the requirements of the
release rates are not required.
(2) Specific watershed requirements:
(a) Paxton Creek Watershed: Specified release rate districts. For
all districts in this category, the future runoff must be
controlled to the specified release rate; that is, the postdevelopment
runoff rate must be less than or equal to the
predevelopment rate multiplied by the specified release rate
for that district.
(b) Paxton Creek Watershed: provisional no-detention districts.
These watershed areas may discharge post-development peak
runoff without detention facilities. However, the applicant must
prove that the "local" runoff conveyance facilities which
transport runoff from the site to the main channel have
adequate capacity to safely transport unattenuated increased
peak flows for a twenty-five-year storm in accordance with
§ 170-114C. If there is inadequate capacity, the applicant shall
either use 100% release rate control or provide increased
capacity within the downstream drainage facilities to convey
increased peak flows consistent with § 170-114C. When
determining if adequate capacity exists in the local watershed
drainage network, the applicant must assume that the entire
local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all
new development will use the least restrictive runoff controls
specified by this article.
(c) Spring Creek Watershed: Specified release rate districts. For
all districts in this category, the future runoff must be
controlled to the specified release rate; that is, the postdevelopment
runoff rate must be less than or equal to the
§ 170-401 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-401
1:269
predevelopment rate multiplied by the specified release rate
for that district.
(d) Beaver Creek Watershed: Specified release rate districts. For
all districts in this category, the future runoff must be
controlled to the specified release rate; that is, the postdevelopment
runoff rate must be less than or equal to the
predevelopment rate multiplied by the specified release rate
for that district.
(e) Areas not within the Paxton, Spring, or Beaver Creek
Watersheds: Standard release rate district. For all areas within
the Township but outside of the Paxton, Spring, or Beaver
Creek Watersheds, the future peak rate of runoff for one-year,
two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year and 100-year design
storms must be controlled equal to or less than the
predevelopment runoff rate for the respective storm
frequencies.
(3) The exact location of any given development site, or activity
regulated by this article relative to the release rate district
boundaries shall be determined by mapping the release rate
district boundaries using two-foot topographic contour mapping
provided as part of the drainage plan.
(4) For a proposed development site located entirely within one
release rate district, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
required release rate criteria.
(5) For sites within one release rate district and having multiple
discharge points, any individual point may be designed to a 100%
release rate, provided that the total runoff from the site is
controlled to the applicable release rate for that district and
adequate downstream capacity exists for the unattenuated flow as
prescribed herein.
(6) For a proposed development site which is located within two or
more release rate districts, the maximum runoff discharged at any
point shall be equal to the release rate for the district in which the
discharge point is located. In the event that a portion of the site is
located in a provisional no detention area, no runoff from portions
of the site located in areas subject to release rate controls may be
drained to or through the provisional no detention area.
(7) Each development site shall be considered separately and shall
conform to the criteria of the district in which it is located. In no
case may the release rate for an area be exceeded as "credit" for a
reduction below the criteria or any other restrictions on a separate
site.
(8) Regional detention facilities may be permitted provided that
adequate conveyance is available or provided from the site to the
§ 170-401 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-401
1:270
facility. The acceptability and discharge characteristics of the
facility will be determined on a case by case basis, by the Township
Engineer, using the calibrated model developed for the Dauphin
County Act 167 Plan.
(9) In no case may a waiver be granted to exempt a proposed
development from meeting the requirements of the release rate
area in which the site is located, except as provided for in
§ 170-302.
§ 170-401 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-401
1:271

ARTICLE V
Erosion and Sedimentation (E&S) Standards
§ 170-501. Erosion and sedimentation requirements during earth
disturbance activities.
A. The applicant shall meet requirements as contained in 25 Pa. Code,
Chapters 92 and 102, as required and applicable as follows:
(1) The implementation and maintenance of erosion and sediment
control BMPs.
(2) Development of written plans.
(3) Submission of plans for approval.
(4) Obtaining erosion and sediment control and NPDES permits.
(5) Maintaining plans and permits on site.
B. Evidence of any necessary plan or permit approval for earth
disturbance activities from PADEP or the Dauphin County Conservation
District must be provided to the Township.
C. A copy of the approved erosion and sediment control plan and any other
permit, as required by PADEP or the Dauphin County Conservation
District, shall be available at the project site at all times if required
under Chapter 102.
D. Construction of temporary roadways (e.g., for utility construction,
timber harvesting, etc.) shall comply with all applicable standards for
erosion and sedimentation control and stream crossing regulations
under 25 Pa. Code, Chapters 102 and 105. The erosion and
sedimentation control plan shall be submitted to the Dauphin County
Conservation District for approval and shall address the following, as
applicable:
(1) Design of the roadway system, including haul roads, skid roads,
landing areas, trails, and storage and staging areas.
(2) Runoff control structures (e.g., diversions, culverts, detention
ponds, etc.).
(3) Stream crossings for both perennial and intermittent streams.
(4) Access to public roadways, including design of rock construction
entrance for mud and debris control.
(5) A remediation plan for restoring the disturbed area through
regrading, topsoil placement, reseeding, and other stabilization
techniques, as required.
§ 170-501 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-501
1:273
§ 170-502. Design criteria statement for stormwater management
and drainage facilities; stormwater management district
implementation provisions.
E. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed
include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, as to
maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall be protected from receiving sediment-laden
runoff.
(3) The source of protection for infiltration BMPs shall be identified
(i.e., orange construction fence surrounding the perimeter of the
BMP).
A. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development
site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable
peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed
to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
B. "No harm" option. For any proposed development site, the applicant has
the option of using a less-restrictive runoff control (including no
detention), if the applicant can prove that "no harm" would be caused
by discharging at a higher runoff rate than existing conditions. The "no
harm" option is used when an applicant can prove that the postdevelopment
hydrographs can match predevelopment hydrographs, or
if it can be proven that the post-development conditions will not cause
increases in peak flows at all points downstream. Proof of "no harm"
would have to be shown based upon a downstream impact evaluation,
which shall include a downstream hydraulic capacity analysis
consistent with § 170-502C to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity
exists. The applicant shall submit this evaluation of the impacts due to
increased downstream stormwater flows in the watershed to the
Township.
(1) The downstream impact evaluation shall include hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the impact of
hydrograph timing modifications due to the proposed development
upon a dam, highway, structure, natural point of restricted stream
flow, or any stream channel section established with the
concurrence of the Township.
(2) Proof of "no harm" must be shown from the point of discharge
through entire downstream network to the mouth of Paxton Creek
or Spring Creek, as applicable, at the Susquehanna River, or from
the mouth of Beaver Creek, as applicable, at the Swatara Creek.
For those areas outside of the Paxton, Spring, or Beaver Creek
§ 170-501 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-502
1:274
Watersheds, proof of "no harm" must be shown through the entire
downstream network to the ultimate discharge point at the
Susquehanna River or Swatara Creek as applicable.
(3) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-year, ten-year, and twenty-fiveyear)
shall be the values from the calibrated model for the Dauphin
County Act 167 Plan. These flow values can be obtained from their
respective watershed plans.
(4) Applicant-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would,
by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to prove "no
harm," except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements
for the problem areas.
(5) A financial hardship shall not constitute grounds for granting a "no
harm" exemption.
(6) Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to
implement the "no harm" option, which proposes specific capacity
improvements to demonstrate that a less stringent discharge
control would not create any harm downstream.
(7) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as
documented by an applicant may be used by the applicant only in
proportion to his/her development site acreage relative to the total
upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity (i.e., if
the applicant's site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage,
he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available
capacity).
(8) The Township in approving a "no harm" option shall notify all
downstream municipalities of such approval. The Township shall
make all relevant information used to prove a "no harm" option
available upon request to any Township within the Paxton, Spring,
or Beaver Creek Watershed.
(9) Any "no harm" justifications shall be submitted by the applicant as
part of the drainage plan submission. The burden of proof shall rest
on the applicant.
C. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this article shall use
the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased
peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a twenty-five-year return
period event within their banks at velocities consistent with
protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall
§ 170-502 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-502
1:275
be based upon criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual.
D. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas within the
watershed, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility
for more than one development site than to provide an individual
control facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for
any regional runoff control alternatives is the responsibility of
prospective applicants. The design of any regional control basins must
incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed.
The peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-bycase
basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with
protection of the downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic model"
refers to the calibrated model as developed for the Dauphin County Act
167 Stormwater Management Plan.
E. Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to permit direct
discharge in a provisional no-detention district, to implement any
regional or subregional detention alternatives, or to implement a "no
harm" option which proposes specific capacity improvements to
document the validity of less stringent discharge control which would
not create any harm downstream.
F. General design guidelines:
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(a) The watersheds are subwatersheds of a commonwatershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(b) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(c) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow type condition.
(3) Stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are encouraged (e.g.,
rooftop storage, drywells, cisterns, recreation area ponding,
diversion structures, porous pavements, holding tanks, infiltration
systems, stream channel storage, in-line storage in storm sewers,
and grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and
constructed in accordance with the latest technical guidance
published by PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed
engineering plans and performance capabilities and supporting
site-specific soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration
rate data to verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from
§ 170-502 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-502
1:276
other sources may be accepted at the discretion of the Township
Engineer (a preapplication meeting is suggested).
(4) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(5) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a municipal or state roadway.
(6) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table or
other soil limiting zone. The invert of stormwater facilities may be
lowered if adequate subsurface drainage, which does not alter the
existing water table level, is provided.
(7) Any stormwater management facility may be required to be fenced
with a minimum four-foot-high fence of material acceptable to the
Township. Gates with a minimum opening of 10 feet shall be
provided for access.
(8) Stormwater management facilities excavated to carbonate rock
must either be fitted with an impervious clay liner, or overexcavated
four feet and refilled with a suitable material mix.
Suitable backfill material is subject to the approval of the Municipal
Engineer.
(9) The type, location, and number of landscaping and planting
specification shall be provided for all stormwater management
facilities and be specific for each type of facility.
G. Topsoil and seeding.
(1) All pond areas, including bottoms, side slopes, and top of berms,
shall be provided with a minimum four inches of topsoil and shall
be seeded and mulched with Formula B seed mixture in accordance
with PENNDOT Publication 408, Section 804.
H. Where uniform flow is anticipated, Manning's Equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient "n" shall be consistent with values as presented in Table C-3,
Appendix C of this chapter.16 Manning's Equation should not be used for
analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of culverts.
I. The Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations and conditions and
site history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
16.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 170-502 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-502
1:277
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and recommendation of the
Township Engineer.
J. Principal outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall
be designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using
any generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
K. At all points of concentrated flow discharge from a site, an adequate
channel must be provided downstream of the point of discharge to
accommodate the flows from the facility so as to prevent damage to
adjacent properties. If an adequate channel does not exist, an adequate
channel shall be constructed or the point of discharge shall be piped to
a point where an adequate channel exists. The approval and written
consent of all affected downstream property owners must also be
provided in the form of an executed drainage easement.
L. Stormwater management facilities (with a depth of water equal to or
greater then three feet measured from the lowest point inside a facility
to the crest of the emergency spillway):
(1) Any stormwater management facility designed to store runoff and
requiring a berm or earthen embankment, shall be designed to
provide an emergency spillway to handle peak rate of stormwater
runoff up to and including the 100-year post-development flow, with
a blocked primary outlet structure. The height of embankment
must be set as to provide a minimum one foot of freeboard through
the spillway, above the maximum water surface elevation,
computed when the spillway functions for the 100-year postdevelopment
inflow, with a blocked outlet structure. The primary
outflow structure must be designed to pass all design storms (up to
and including the 100-year event) without discharging through the
emergency spillway. The maximum water depth within any
stormwater management facility shall be no greater than eight feet
when functioning through the primary outlet structure.
(2) Emergency spillways shall be armored to prevent erosion during
the 100-year post-development flow, with blocked primary outlet
structure. Synthetic liners or rip-rap may be used, and calculations
sufficient to support proposed armor must be provided. An earthen
plug must be used to accurately control the spillway invert if riprap
is the proposed armoring material. Emergency spillway armor
must extend up the sides of the spillway, and continue at full width
to a minimum of 10 feet past the toe of slope.
(3) A stormwater management facility berm cross sections must be at
least five feet wide at the top, and eight feet wide through the
emergency spillway. For fill embankments, the side slopes shall be
no steeper then 3:1 on the inside of the facility and 3:1 on the
§ 170-502 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-502
1:278
outside of the facility. For cut slopes, the side slopes shall be no
steeper then 2:1.
(4) A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be provided
under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
(5) Soils used for the construction of stormwater management
facilities shall have low-erodibility factors ("K" factors) (refer to
E&S Manual) and be identified on the SWM site plan.
(6) Trash racks must be provided to prevent clogging of primary
outflow structure stages for all orifices equivalent to 12 inches or
smaller in diameter.
(7) Anti-seep collars must be provided on all outflow culverts in
accordance with the methodology contained in the latest edition of
the E&S Manual. An increase in seepage length of 15% must be
used in accordance with the requirements for permanent anti-seep
collars.
(8) Conventional, non-BMP stormwater management facilities (i.e., dry
detention basins) must empty over a period of time not less than 24
hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the facility's
inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests performed at the facility
locations and proposed basin bottom depths, in accordance with
the BMP Manual, must support time-to-empty calculations if
infiltration is a factor is the sizing of the stormwater management
facility.
(9) Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities to promote water quality and groundwater
recharge for frequent storm events. Facilities designed as water
quality/infiltration BMPs may have a bottom slope of zero. Minimal
maintenance, saturation tolerant vegetation must be provided in
basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs. Conventional,
non-BMP stormwater management facilities must have a minimum
slope of 1% extending radially out from the primary outlet
structure. Water storage below the lowest outlet structure stage
(i.e., dead storage) is permitted in stormwater management
facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
(10) Stormwater management facilities bottom elevations must be
greater than adjacent floodplain elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS
analysis). If no floodplain is defined, bottom elevations must be
higher than existing ground elevations 50 feet from top of stream
bank in the facilities vicinity.
(11) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the 100-year floodplain
elevation may be used for all design storms, or the applicant may
elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent watercourse for
each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be 50 feet from top
§ 170-502 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-502
1:279
of stream bank in areas where a floodplain is not designated, or
where no other evidence is provided.
(12) Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of
the Township for BMPs that retain or detain water, but are of a
much smaller scale than traditional stormwater management
facilities.
M. Storm sewer facilities:
(1) Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from
a ten-year design storm without surcharging inlets where
appropriate. When connecting to an existing storm sewer system,
the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed system will not
exacerbate any existing stormwater problems and that adequate
downstream capacity exists.
(2) A minimum pipe size of 15 inches in diameter shall be used in all
roadway systems (public or private) proposed for construction.
Pipes shall be designed to provide a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet
per second when flowing full, but in all cases, the slope shall be no
less then 0.5%. Arch pipe of equivalent cross-sectional area may be
substituted in lieu of circular pipe where cover or utility conflict
conditions exist.
(3) In proposed curbed roadway sections, the maximum encroachment
of water on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a
through travel lane or one inch less than the depth of curb during
the ten-year design storm of five-minute duration. Gutter depth
shall be verified by inlet capture/capacity calculations that account
for road slope and opening area. The maximum distance between
inlets in curbed roadway sections shall be no more then 600 feet,
however access to underground pipes shall be provided every 300
feet.
(4) Standard Type "C" inlets with eight-inch hoods shall be used along
vertical concrete curbs roadway networks. Type "C" inlets with teninch
hoods that provide a two-inch sump condition may be used
with approval of the Municipal Engineer when roadway
longitudinal slopes are 1.0% or less.
(5) For inlets containing a change in pipe size, the elevation for the
crown of the pipes shall be the same or the smaller pipe's crown
shall be at a higher elevation.
(6) All inlets shall provide a minimum two-inch drop between the

§ 170-502 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-503
1:282
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site.
C. Rainfall values:
(1) Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time-of-concentration and return
period.
(2) Soil Cover Complex Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type II,

with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or consistent with the
following table:
Return Interval
(year)
24-hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.40
2 2.90
10 4.36
25 5.43
50 6.38
100 7.48
D. Peak flow rates:
(1) Rational Method: may be used for drainage areas up to 20 acres.
Extreme caution should be used by the qualified professional if the
watershed has more then one main drainage channel, if the
watershed is divided so that hydrologic properties are significantly
different in one verses the other, if the time of concentration
exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff volume is an important
factor. The combination of Rational Method hydrographs based on
timing shall be prohibited.
(a) The use of the Modified Rational Method to design stormwater
management facilities must be approved by the Municipal
Engineer.
(2) Soil Cover Complex Method: may be used for drainage areas
greater then 20 acres. This method is recommended for design of
stormwater management facilities and where stormwater runoff
volume must be taken into consideration.
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
E. Runoff coefficients:
§ 170-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-503
1:283
(1) Rational Method: Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).17
(2) Soil Cover Complex Method: Use Table C-2 (Appendix C).
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious areas conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present on
the project site, and contained within the new proposed limit of
disturbance, shall be considered meadow (good condition) for
predevelopment hydrologic calculations for redevelopment.
F. Design storm:
(1) All drainage facilities (inlets, pipes, and swales) shall be designed
to safely convey the ten-year storm.
(2) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-year, two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year, fiftyyear,
and 100-year hydrographs through the facility using the
Storage Indication (Modified Puls) Method. The design storm
hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that
produces a full hydrograph.
(3) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development 100-year storm
event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of meeting
peak rate control.
(4) All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway.
(5) All design within state or federal rights-of-way or that falls under
the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the
requirements of that agency in addition to meeting the minimum
requirements of this chapter.
G. Time of concentration:
(1) Time of concentration shall be computed using the NRCS
Segmental Method as described in TR-55 (SCS 1986, or most
current update). The length of sheet flow shall be limited to 100
feet. The Manning's "n" Roughness Coefficient for TR-55 sheet flow
can be found in Table C-4 (Appendix C).18 Time of concentration for
channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's
Equation.

18.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 170-503 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 170-503
1:284
(2) For sites with insignificant channelized flow and less than 20%
imperviousness coverage, the time of concentration may be
computed using the NRCS equation for lag time:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6)*60](minutes)
(S + 1)0.7
Tlag = L0.8 1900 Y
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours).
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet).
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent).
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by: S =
[(1,000/CN) - 10].
CN = NRCS Curve Number for watershed as defined by the
NRCS Loss Method.
(3) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The post-development time of concentration shall never be
greater that the predevelopment time of concentration for any
watershed or subwatershed.
(b) The minimum time of concentration for any watershed shall be
five minutes.
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute time of
concentration for any post-development watershed or
subwatershed without providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment time-of-concentration paths. A five-minute
time of concentration can not be assumed for predevelopment.
(e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of time-ofconcentration
calculations.
H. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining predevelopment flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be removed from peak runoff rates in the post-
§ 170-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-503
1:285
development analysis. New, additional contributing runoff shall not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
I. Where uniform flow is anticipated, Manning's Equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Manning's Equation should not be
used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from Table C-3
(Appendix C).19 Inlet control shall be checked at all inlet boxes to
ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design event is
contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
J. The Township may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.
K. The Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more-appropriate runoff and time-of-concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and approval of the Township.

the timely installation and proper construction of all stormwater
management controls as required by the approved SWM site plan and
this chapter, equal to 110% of the full construction cost of the required
controls in accordance with the Municipalities Planning Code.
B. At the completion of the project and as a prerequisite for the release of
the financial guarantee, the applicant shall:
(1) Provide a certification of completion from an engineer, architect,
surveyor or other qualified professional, verifying that all
permanent facilities have been constructed according to the SWM
site plan and report and approved revisions thereto.

maintenance description shall outline required routine maintenance
actions and schedules necessary to ensure proper operation of the
stormwater control facilities.
B. The SWM site plan and report for the project site shall establish
responsibilities for the continuing operation and maintenance of all
proposed stormwater control facilities, consistent with the following
principles:
(1) If a development consists of structures or lots that are to be
separately owned and in which streets, sewers, and other public
improvements are to be dedicated to the Township, stormwater
control facilities/BMPs may also be dedicated to and maintained by
the Township.
(2) If a development site is to be maintained in a single ownership or if
sewers and other public improvements are to be privately owned
and maintained, then the ownership and maintenance of
stormwater control facilities/BMPs shall be the responsibility of the
owner or private management entity.
§ 170-801 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-802
1:295
§ 170-803. Maintenance agreement for privately owned stormwater

requirements for approval of the SWM site plan. Such a requirement is
not an indication that the Township will accept the facilities. The
Township reserves the right to accept or reject the ownership and
operating responsibility for any portion of the stormwater management
controls.
D. If the Township accepts ownership of stormwater BMPs, the Township
may, at its discretion, require a fee from the applicant to the Township
to offset the future cost of inspections, operations, and maintenance.
E. It shall be unlawful to alter or remove any permanent stormwater BMP
required by an approved SWM site plan, or to allow the property to
remain in a condition which does not conform to an approved SWM site
plan, unless the Township grants an exception in writing.
A. Prior to final approval of the SWM site plan and report, the applicant
shall sign the operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement (Appendix
A)22 covering all stormwater control facilities that are to be privately
owned. The operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement shall be
recorded with the SWM site plan and made a part hereto.
B. Other items may be included in the operation and maintenance (O&M)
agreement where determined necessary to guarantee the satisfactory
operation and maintenance of all BMP facilities. The operation and
maintenance (O&M) agreement shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Township and the Municipal Solicitor.
C. The owner is responsible for operation and maintenance of the
stormwater BMPs. If the owner fails to adhere to the operation and
maintenance (O&M) agreement, the Township may perform the

state regulations.
(1)
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Earth
Disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
(2)
Water quality involves the chemical, biological, and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After earth disturbance
activities are complete, these characteristics can be impacted by
addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes in habitat
through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result of changes
in land surface area from those activities. Therefore, permanent
discharges to surface waters must be managed to protect the
stream bank, streambed, and structural integrity of the waterway,
to prevent these impacts.

ARTICLE III
Plan Processing Procedures
§ 180-301. Intent.
§ 180-302. Preapplication sketch plans.
§ 180-303. Preliminary subdivision or land development plan
applications.
A. The procedures established in this article are intended to define the
steps by which an applicant shall design, make application, record
plats, and construct improvements and by which the Township Planning
Commission may review and Board of Supervisors shall approve or
disapprove plans and otherwise administer these regulations.
B. For all subdivision and land development applications, a preliminary
plan and final plan procedure is provided. It is at the discretion of the
applicant to submit either a preliminary plan followed by a final plan or
a combined preliminary/final plan. However, submission of the
preliminary/final plan excuses the applicant from submitting a separate
preliminary plan and stands as both a preliminary and final plan. All
preliminary/final plans must conform to all preliminary and final plan
processing procedures and content requirements. Plans must be clearly
labeled "PRELIMINARY/FINAL PLAN." Provisions are also provided for
the submission of sketch plans for informal review by the Township.
A. Prior to the formal submission of a subdivision or land development
plan, the applicant is urged to submit a sketch plan to the Township
Planning Commission for advice on the requirements necessary to
achieve conformity to the standards of these regulations as well as to
alert the applicant as early as possible to factors which must be
considered in the design of a subdivision or land development, such as
pertinent elements of any county or Township land use, thoroughfare or
other community plans. Review of a sketch plan is not required and is
only an informal, advisory process to guide the applicant with the
eventual preparation of a formal preliminary or final plan, as applicable.
B. Sketch plans should be accompanied by a letter of transmittal and a
project narrative necessary to explain existing or proposed site
conditions which are not self-explanatory on the actual sketch.
C. Application. The applicant, 14 days prior to the meeting of the Planning
Commission at which review of the sketch plan is desired, shall file with
the Zoning Officer 10 copies of a sketch plan of the proposed
subdivision or land development and other applicable maps,
information and data. The Township staff, Township Engineer, County
Planning Commission and other departments or agencies will not
provide a formal review of the plan and issue written comments but
merely provide a general overview and provide commentary at the
Planning Commission meeting at which the plan is being discussed.
§ 180-301 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-303
1:363
A. Application. A plan clearly labeled "PRELIMINARY PLAN" complying
with the requirements of Article IV shall be prepared for each
subdivision or land development and submitted to the Township in the
form of 16 paper prints no greater than 24 inches by 36 inches sheets.
In addition, two copies of all applicable supplementary data, plans and
reports; four copies of the completed Sewage Facilities Planning
Module; one correct and complete Application for Subdivision and Land
Development Review Form and Subdivision and Land Development
Plan Submission Checklist as contained in Exhibit 1 herein;26 and the
required Township filing fees must be submitted prior to review by the
Township. The applicant shall also file with the Township one completed
application form and the appropriate filing fees as required by the
Dauphin County Planning Commission for review of the subdivision or
land development application. All plans and accompanying information
must be submitted to the Township during normal business hours no
less than 28 days prior to the regularly scheduled Planning Commission
meeting at which consideration is requested.
B. Administratively complete applications. Upon receipt of an application
for subdivision or land development review, the Township will
determine if the filing contains all required information as prescribed
by this chapter to constitute a complete and thorough application. Upon
receipt of an incomplete application, the Township shall, within seven
calendar days, notify the applicant or the applicant's representative
that the application for a subdivision or land development plan is
incomplete and will not be further processed. All materials submitted
will be made available to be picked up by the applicant or their
representative, and no further review will be provided.
C. Review. The Township shall, as applicable, submit copies of the
application to the Planning Commission, the Township Engineer, the
Dauphin County Planning Commission, the Township Authority, the
Township Public Works Department, the Township Public Safety
Committee, and other public agencies or departments as necessary for
review. The Board of Supervisors, upon the recommendation of the
Planning Commission, shall act on any such preliminary plan not later
than 90 days following the date of the regular meeting of the Board of
Supervisors or the Planning Commission (which ever first reviews the
application) following the day the application is filed, provided that
should the said next regular meeting occur more than 30 days following
the filing of the application, the said ninety-day period shall be
measured from the 30th day following the day the application has been
duly filed. In the event that any modification of requirements from this
article is requested by the applicant or is deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission, the alteration and the reason for its necessity
shall be entered in the records of the Planning Commission.
26.Editor's Note: Exhibit 1 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 180-303 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-303
1:364
D. The Dauphin County Planning Commission shall review the application
and shall return one copy of a written report stating their suggestions
for modifications and design changes to the Planning Commission
within 30 days of their receipt of same or forfeit their right to review.
E. Processing of sewage facilities planning modules. All subdivision and/or
land development plans shall comply with Section 5 of the Act of
January 24, 1966, P.O. 1535, No. 537, known as the "Pennsylvania
Sewage Facilities Act," as amended, and the Rules and Regulations of
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
adopted thereunder, Chapter 71 of Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code.
Such act and regulations require the Township to adopt an Official
Sewage Facilities Plan which provides for sewage services adequate to
prevent contamination of waters and/or environmental health hazards
with sewage wastes. Further, the Township shall revise said plan when
it is determined that a proposed method of sewage disposal for a new
subdivision or land development conforms to a comprehensive program
of pollution control and water quality management.
(1) The proposed subdivision and/or land development of a parcel of
land and its associated sanitary sewage facilities shall be as
described in detail by the applicant as part of a Sewage Facilities
Planning Module for Land Development. Said Planning Module
shall be submitted with the preliminary plan or in the case of a
combined submission with the preliminary/final plan.
(2) The Township shall review the Planning Module for the proposed
subdivision and/or land development, and determine if the
proposed method of sewage disposal conforms to and is included in
the approved "Official Plan" of the Municipality of Lower Paxton
Township.
(3) The Township shall review the subdivision and/or land development
plan described in the attached Planning Module and determine if it
conforms to applicable zoning, subdivision, other municipal
ordinances and plans, and to a comprehensive program of pollution
control and water quality management.
(4) The Board of Supervisors shall act upon the Planning Module in
conjunction with or after action on the preliminary plan or in the
case of a combined submission with or after action on the
preliminary/final plan. At no time shall the Township act upon a
Planning Module prior to acting upon a preliminary plan or a
preliminary/final plan. Planning Modules approved by the Board of
Supervisors shall be submitted to and approved by DEP as a
revision to the "Official Plan" of the Township.
(5) Planning Modules for subdivisions and/or land development,
approved by the Board of Supervisors and DEP, shall continue as an
amendment of the "Official Plan" until such time as:
§ 180-303 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-303
1:365
(a) A final plan is not submitted to the Township within five years
of the date of approval of the preliminary plan unless the plan
is in accordance with a previously approved and updated
phasing schedule or extended in writing by the Board of
Supervisors.
(b) The preliminary/final or final subdivision and/or land
development plan is withdrawn or abandoned, as indicated in
writing by the applicant.
(6) Planning Modules for subdivisions and/or land development,
approved by the Board of Supervisors and DEP. shall serve to revise
the "Official Plan" for only the site specific location referenced
within the Planning Module. Sanitary sewer capacity identified
within a Planning Module for a site specific location, approved by
the Board of Supervisors shall not be transferred to or used at any
other location within the Township.
(7) The approval of a Planning Module by the Board of Supervisors
does not obligate the Township to provide building permits and/or
sanitary sewer connection permits. The availability of such permits
may be limited by DEP and/or the operators of treatment plants
receiving Township sanitary sewage.
F. Resubmission of plans. When action on a plan has been tabled or
postponed by the Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors due to
outstanding comments, deficiencies or other issues with the
application; tabled at the request of the applicant; or conditionally
recommended for approval by the Planning Commission subject to
addressing review comments; and the applicant must resubmit a
corrected application to the Township, all plans and accompanying
information must be resubmitted to the Township during normal
business hours no less than 21 days prior to the regularly scheduled
Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors meeting at which
reconsideration is requested. If the revised plan is to be resubmitted to
the Planning Commission for review, nine copies of all plans and two
copies of all reports and accompanying documents must be submitted;
otherwise, for submissions to the Board of Supervisors, two copies of all
plans, reports and accompanying documents must be submitted; and, in
either case, must be accompanied by a formal written response
sufficiently addressing in detail all outstanding review comments or
questions. Based upon the number and significance of any remaining
comments, the Zoning Officer, in consultation with the Township
Engineer, will determine whether a plan is complete and ready to be
included on the agenda of the Planning Commission or Board of
Supervisors for consideration. A withdrawn application must be filed as
an entirely new application to be further considered by the Township.
G. Before acting on any application, the Board of Supervisors may hold a
public hearing thereon after proper public notice.
§ 180-303 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-303
1:366
H. When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision
shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the
provisions of this article, statute or other ordinance relied upon.
I. Failure of the Board of Supervisors to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner
described herein shall be deemed an approval of the application in
terms as last presented unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an
extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of presentation of
communication of the decision, in which case, failure to meet the
extended time or change in manner of presentation of communication
shall have like effect. (A sample "Agreement to Extend the Time for
Rendering and Communicating a Decision on Certain Preliminary and/
or Final Subdivision/Land Development Plans" is contained in Exhibit 5
herein).27
J. Approval or disapproval. The Board of Supervisors shall review the
preliminary plan at a regularly scheduled public meeting following the
submission of the written review and recommendations of the Township
Planning Commission, Township Engineer, and County Planning
Commission, or at some other public meeting or meetings of the Board
prior to the end of the statutory ninety-day review period. Upon
completion of its review, the Board of Supervisors shall determine
whether the plan shall be approved, approved with conditions
acceptable to the applicant, or disapproved. The decision shall be made
in writing and shall be communicated to the applicant personally or
mailed to him at his last known address not later than 15 days following
the decision. If the plan is approved with conditions, the applicant shall
respond to the Board of Supervisors indicating acceptance or rejection
of such conditions. Such response shall be made in writing, signed by
the applicant, and received by the Township within 15 calendar days of
receipt by the applicant of the Board of Supervisors' decision to
approve the plan with conditions. Approval of the plan shall be
rescinded automatically upon the applicant's failure to accept such
conditions in the manner and within the time frame noted above.
K. Approval of the preliminary plan constitutes approval of the proposed
subdivision or land development with respect to the general design, the
approximate dimensions and other planned features. Preliminary
approval binds the applicant to the plan as approved. Material changes
to the plan shall not be permitted once approved by the Board of
Supervisors.
L. Following the approval of the preliminary plan, including the
satisfaction of all conditions of approval, the applicant shall provide the
Township with four complete signed and sealed paper copies of the
preliminary plan, one reproducible Mylar copy of the same and two
27.Editor's Note: Exhibit 5 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 180-303 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-303
1:367
§ 180-304. Final subdivision or land development plan applications.
signed and sealed copies of all approved reports for the Township's
records.
M. Plan status.
(1) Approval of the preliminary plan shall assure the applicant for a
period of five years from the date of approval, or such other longer
period as may be set forth on a detailed phasing schedule
submitted by the applicant and approved by the Township, that:
(a) The general layout and approximate dimension of streets, lots,
and other features are approved and shall be the basis for the
preparation of the final plan;
(b) The general terms and any special conditions under which the
approval of the plan was granted will not be changed; and
(c) The applicant may install improvements in accordance with the
approved preliminary plan and other requirements contained
in this chapter. The Township Engineer shall be responsible for
inspection and approval of the required improvements as
provided for in this chapter.
(2) Preliminary plan approval does not constitute approval of the final
plan and, therefore, does not authorize the recording of the
subdivision or land development plan, the sale or transfer of lots, or
the construction of buildings or other structures on the property.
(3) The effects of changes to this chapter on plan status are more fully
described in Article XI herein.
A. Application. Within five years after the approval of the preliminary plan,
a plan clearly labeled "FINAL PLAN" with all necessary supplemental
data, plans and reports as contained herein shall be officially submitted
to the Township. Failure to submit a final plan within five years of the
date of approval of the preliminary plan shall subject the preliminary
plan to all intervening governing ordinances unless the plan is in
accordance with a previously approved and updated phasing schedule
or extended in writing by the Board of Supervisors. A preliminary plan
not consistent with the above shall not be used as a basis for any
development or construction. Any subsequent development shall be
preceded by a new preliminary plan application.
B. When filing an application for final approval, a final plan complying with
the requirements of Article IV shall be prepared for each subdivision or
land development and submitted to the Township in the form of 16
paper prints no greater than 24 inches by 36 inches sheets. In addition,
two copies of all applicable supplementary data, plans and reports; one
correct and complete Application for Subdivision and Land
Development Review Form and Subdivision and Land Development
§ 180-303 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-304
1:368
Plan Submission Checklist as contained in Exhibit 1 herein;28 and the
appropriate filing fees must be submitted prior to review by the
Township. The applicant shall also file with the Township one completed
application form and the appropriate filing fees as required by the
Dauphin County Planning Commission for review of the subdivision
or land development application. All plans must be submitted to the
Township during normal business hours no less than 28 days prior
to the regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting at which
consideration is requested.
C. Administratively complete applications. Upon receipt of an application
for subdivision or land development review, the Township will
determine if the filing contains all required information as prescribed
by this chapter to constitute a complete and thorough application. Upon
receipt of an incomplete application, the Township shall within seven
calendar days notify the applicant or the applicant's representative that
the application for a subdivision or land development plan is incomplete
and will not be further processed. All materials submitted will be made
available to be picked up by the applicant or their representative, and
no further review will be provided.
D. Review. The Township shall, as applicable, submit copies of the
application to the Planning Commission, the Township Engineer, the
Dauphin County Planning Commission, the Township Authority, the
Township Public Works Department, the Township Public Safety
Committee, and other public agencies or departments as necessary for
review of the application. The Board of Supervisors, upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, shall act on any such
final plan not later than 90 days following the date of the regular
meeting of the Board of Supervisors or the Planning Commission
(whichever first reviews the application) following the day the
application is filed, provided that should the said next regular meeting
occur more than 30 days following the filing of the application, the said
ninety-day period shall be measured from the 30th day following the
day the application has been duly filed. In the event that any
modification of requirements from this article is requested by the
applicant or is deemed necessary by the Planning Commission for
approval, the alteration and the reason for its necessity shall be entered
in the records of the Planning Commission.
E. The Dauphin County Planning Commission shall review the application
and shall return one copy of a written report stating their suggestions
for modifications and design changes to the Planning Commission
within 30 days of their receipt of the same or forfeit their right to
review.
F. Resubmission of plans. When action on a plan has been tabled or
postponed by the Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors due to
outstanding comments, deficiencies or other issues with the
28.Editor's Note: Exhibit 1 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 180-304 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-304
1:369
application; tabled at the request of the applicant; or conditionally
recommended for approval by the Planning Commission subject to
addressing review comments; and the applicant must resubmit a
corrected application to the Township, all plans and accompanying
information must be resubmitted to the Township during normal
business hours no less than 21 days prior to the regularly scheduled
Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors meeting at which
reconsideration is requested. If the revised plan is to be resubmitted to
the Planning Commission for review, nine copies of all plans and two
copies of all reports and accompanying documents must be submitted;
otherwise, for submissions to the Board of Supervisors, two copies of
all plans, reports and accompanying documents must be submitted;
and, in either case, must be accompanied by a formal written response
sufficiently addressing in detail all outstanding review comments or
questions. Based upon the number and significance of any remaining
comments, the Zoning Officer, in consultation with the Township
Engineer, will determine whether a plan is complete and ready to
be included on the agenda of the Planning Commission or Board of
Supervisors for consideration. A withdrawn application must be filed as
an entirely new application to be further considered by the Township.
G. Before acting on any application, the Board of Supervisors may hold a
public hearing thereon after proper public notice.
H. When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision
shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the
provisions of this article, statute or other ordinance relied upon.
I. Failure of the Board of Supervisors to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner
described herein shall be deemed an approval of the application in
terms as last presented unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an
extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of presentation of
communication of the decision, in which case, failure to meet the
extended time or change in manner of presentation of communication
shall have like effect. (A sample "Agreement to Extend the Time for
Rendering and Communicating a Decision on Certain Preliminary and/
or Final Subdivision/Land Development Plans" is contained in Exhibit 5
herein).29
J. Approval or disapproval. The Board of Supervisors shall review the final
plan at a regularly scheduled public meeting following the submission
of the written review and recommendations of the Township Planning
Commission, Township Engineer, and County Planning Department, or
at some other public meeting or meetings of the Board prior to the end
of the statutory ninety-day review period. Upon completion of its
review, the Board of Supervisors shall determine whether the plan shall
be approved, approved with conditions acceptable to the applicant, or
29.Editor's Note: Exhibit 5 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 180-304 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-304
1:370
disapproved. The decision shall be made in writing and shall be
communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him at his last
known address not later than 15 days following the decision. If the plan
is approved with conditions, the applicant shall respond to the Board
of Supervisors indicating acceptance or rejection of such conditions.
Such response shall be made in writing, signed by the applicant, and
received by the Township within 15 calendar days of receipt by the
applicant of the Board of Supervisors' decision to approve the plan with
conditions. Approval of the plan shall be rescinded automatically upon
the applicant's failure to accept or reject such conditions in the manner
and within the time frame noted above. However, no plat shall be finally
approved unless the streets on such plat have been improved as may be
required by ordinance, and any walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights,
fire hydrants, shade trees, landscaping, water mains, sanitary sewers,
storm sewers, stormwater management facilities, and other site
improvements as may be required by this article and any applicable
municipal requirements have been properly installed in accordance
with such requirements. In lieu of the completion of any site
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plan,
financial security, as delineated in this article, must be provided and
accepted by the Board of Supervisors.
K. Following the approval of the final plan, including the satisfaction of all
conditions of approval, the applicant shall provide the Township with
eight complete signed and sealed paper copies of the final plan, one
reproducible Mylar copy of the same, two signed and sealed copies of
all approved reports and the required electronic data files in the format
required in Article IV, § 180-404E(16).
L. Recording.
(1) The final plan shall be recorded within 90 days of meeting all
conditions imposed on the final plan or, if no conditions, then within
90 days of the approval by the Board of Supervisors. The signed
and sealed plans shall be filed and recorded in the office of the
County Recorder of Deeds, and the signed and sealed Mylar shall
be retained for the Township's records. Whenever plan approval by
the Board of Supervisors is required, the Recorder of Deeds shall
not accept any plan for recording unless such plan officially notes
the approval of the Board of Supervisors and the review of the
Dauphin County Planning Commission.
(2) Recording shall entitle the applicant to sell, transfer or develop the
land shown on the plan in accordance with the approved plan,
subject to any conditions attached thereto. Where final plans are
approved for only a portion, section or phase of the entire
subdivision or land development, sale, transfer or development
may proceed only on that approved portion, section or phase.
M. When a final plan has been approved, no subsequent change or
amendment in zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance shall
§ 180-304 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-304
1:371
§ 180-305. Improvement and maintenance guarantee.
be applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence
and complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance
with the terms of such approval within five years from such approval.
Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid
five-year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary
approval.
N. When the applicant has failed to substantially complete the required
improvements set forth on the approved plan within five years of the
aforesaid approval date and when changes in a zoning, subdivision, or
other governing ordinance have occurred which affect the design of the
approved plat, the subdivision or land development shall be subject to
the changes in the zoning, subdivision, or other governing ordinance.
A. No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plan
have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this chapter,
and any sidewalks, walkways, pathways, curbs, gutters, street lights,
parking lots, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers,
storm sewers, landscaping, landscape berm grading and other
improvements as may be required by this chapter have been installed in
accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plan,
including improvements or fees otherwise required by this chapter, the
applicant may deposit with the Township financial security in an
amount sufficient to cover the costs of such plan improvements or
common amenities, including basins and other related drainage
facilities, recreational facilities, open space improvements, traffic and
transportation improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may
be required in accordance with any land use ordinance. The applicant
shall not be required to provide financial security for the cost of any
improvements for which financial security is required by and provided
to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in connection with
the issuance of a highway occupancy permit for the project.
B. When requested by the applicant, in order to facilitate financing, the
Board of Supervisors shall furnish the applicant with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon the
applicant obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plan or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial security
agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent approval
shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security
agreement is not executed within 90 days unless a written extension is
granted by the Board of Supervisors; such extension shall not be
unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the request of
the applicant.
C. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably

1:372
withheld, federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed the preferred and acceptable
method of financial security for the purposes of this article. Said
instruments of financial security shall be prepared in a format
containing an "evergreen clause" which causes said security to renew
automatically on an annual basis unless otherwise authorized by the
Township. (Sample "Security Agreements" and a sample "Irrevocable
Letter of Credit" are contained in Exhibits 6 and 7 herein. These
documents are recommended formats and may be amended as
necessary by the Board of Supervisors).30
D. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the
party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
commonwealth and maintains an office within 100 miles of the
Township's Administration Building upon which the financial security
can be readily secured by the Township in the event of a default by the
applicant.
E. Such security shall provide for, and secure to the public the completion
of any improvements which may be required on or before the date fixed
in the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for
completion of the improvements.
F. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the applicant. In addition, the applicant shall include an additional 10%
of the total amount of the financial security to cover engineering
inspection fees associated with the installation of said improvements;
the preparation of as-built plans and related work. Annually, the
Township may adjust the amount of the financial security by comparing
the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and
the estimated cost of the completion of the remaining improvements as
of the expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said
adjustment, the Township may require the applicant to post additional
security equal to said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by
the applicant in accordance with this subsection.
G. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by an applicant and prepared by a professional engineer
licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified by such engineer
to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The Township, upon
the recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to accept
such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant and the Township
30.Editor's Note: Exhibits 6 and 7 are included as attachments to this chapter.
§ 180-305 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-305
1:373
are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer licensed
as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Township
and the applicant. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be
presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the
event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the applicant.
H. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period.
I. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plans by
sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvements in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally
approved section of the development.
J. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the partial release, from time to
time, of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to
the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests
shall be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors and shall
detail the specific improvements that are being requested for release.
The Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of such
request within which to allow the Township Engineer to certify, in
writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such portion of the work upon
the improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved
plan. Upon such certification the Board of Supervisors shall authorize
release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as
estimated by the Township Engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if the Board of Supervisors fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Board of Supervisors shall be
deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The Board
of Supervisors may, prior to final release at the time of completion and
certification by its engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated
cost of the aforesaid improvements.
K. Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Board of Supervisors
may require the posting of financial security to secure structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plan for a term not to exceed 18 months from the
§ 180-305 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-305
1:374
date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be of
the same type as otherwise required in this Section with regard to
installation of such improvements, and the amount of the financial
security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
L. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Township, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this section.
M. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition of the final approval of a plan as
set forth in this section, the Township shall not condition the issuance of
building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement
of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted
upon the final plan upon actual completion of the improvements
depicted upon the approved final plan. Moreover, if said financial
security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or
buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following: the
improvement of the streets providing access to and from existing public
roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise
permanently passable condition, as well as the completion of all other
improvements as depicted upon the approved plan, either upon the lot
or lots or beyond the lots in question if such improvements are
necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or
buildings.
N. Release of financial security. When the applicant has completed all of
the necessary and appropriate improvements, the applicant shall notify
the Board of Supervisors, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of
the completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the Township Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall,
within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the
Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The
Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report in writing, with the
Board of Supervisors, who shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the
applicant by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and
mailed within 30 days after receipt by the Township Engineer of the
foresaid authorization from the Board of Supervisors; said report shall
be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said
improvements, either in whole or in part and if said improvements or
any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the
Township Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for
such non approval or rejection.
§ 180-305 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-305
1:375
O. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the applicant, within 15 days of
receipt of the Township Engineer's report, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the action of said Board of Supervisors with relation
thereto.
P. If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements
will be deemed to have been approved, and the applicant shall be
released from all liability pursuant to this performance guaranty or
other security agreement.
Q. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the applicant shall proceed to
complete the same, and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
R. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as a limitation of the
applicant's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Board of Supervisors or the
Township Engineer.
S. The applicant shall reimburse the Township for the reasonable and
necessary expense incurred for the inspection of improvements
according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors and as from time to time amended.
T. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense in
connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall,
within 15 days of the date of billing, notify the Township that such
expenses are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case
the Township shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land
development due to the applicant's request over disputed engineer
expenses.
U. If within 45 days from the date of billing, the Township and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Township shall
jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another professional engineer
licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to review the
said expenses and make a determination as to the amount thereof
which is reasonable and necessary.
V. The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence and
review such documentation as the professional engineer, in his or her
sole opinion, deems necessary and render a decision within 30 days of
appointment. The applicant shall be required to pay the entire amount
determined in the decision immediately.

either by mutual agreement of the Township and applicant or by
the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, shall hear such
evidence and review such documentation as the professional
engineer or professional consultant, in his or her sole opinion,
deems necessary and render a decision within 30 days of
appointment. Such decision shall be final and binding upon both
the Township and the applicant. The applicant shall be required to
pay the entire amount determined in the decision within 10 days of

ARTICLE V
Design Standards
§ 180-501. Intent.
The design standards established in this chapter are intended to be
fundamental requirements to be applied with professional skill in the
subdividing and planning of land so as to produce attractive and
harmonious neighborhoods, convenient and safe streets, and economical
layouts of residential and other land development. The design standards
are further intended to encourage and promote flexibility and ingenuity in
the layout and design of subdivisions and land developments, in accordance
with modern and evolving principles of site planning and development.
§ 180-502. Application.
The following principles, standards, and requirements will be applied by
the Board of Supervisors and Planning Commission in their review and
evaluation of all subdivision and land development plan applications:
A. The standards and requirements contained herein shall be considered
the minimum for the promotion of the public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare.
B. Where literal compliance with the standards and requirements
contained herein is clearly impractical, the Board of Supervisors may
modify or waive such standards through the modification of
requirements process set forth in this chapter.
C. Subdivision and land development plans shall be given due
consideration to "Official Plans" of the Township, Dauphin County
region, or to such parts thereof as may be adopted pursuant to statute.
The Township Greenway Plan shall also be considered in the design and
dedication of open space and recreation areas.
D. Proposed land uses shall conform to the Lower Paxton Township Zoning
Ordinance, as amended.
E. Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property, such as may arise
from fire, flood, disease, or other causes, shall not be planned for
development purposes unless such hazards have been eliminated or
unless the plan shall show adequate safeguards against them, which
shall be approved by the Township and/or appropriate regulatory
agencies.
F. Whenever a subdivision or land development plat or plan is submitted
which sets forth new streets or other ways of ingress and egress other
than a single cul-de-sac street, two separate points of ingress to and
egress from the land affected, or any significant portion thereof, must
be designated thereon. Such points of ingress and egress must be
designed and built to conform to the design and construction
requirements of Lower Paxton Township for public streets. An applicant
§ 180-501 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-502
1:399
§ 180-503. Streets.
may request a modification of this requirement and shall in support
thereof, present evidence that due to topography, site distance,
wetlands, environmental constraints, configuration of land, distance
between intersections or other unique factors not created by the
applicant, it is impractical to have a second way of ingress and egress.
Upon due consideration of these factors, the Board of Supervisors, at
their sole discretion, may grant the request for said modification.
A. General standards.
(1) Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or
parts thereof as have been officially adopted by Lower Paxton
Township and shall be coordinated with existing or proposed
streets in adjoining subdivisions or land developments. Further,
proposed streets shall be properly related to county, regional or
State transportation plans as have been prepared and adopted as
prescribed by law.
(2) Streets shall be laid out to preserve the integrity of their design.
Local access streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by
through traffic and, where possible, collector and arterial streets
shall be designed for use by through traffic.
(3) Streets shall be related to the topography so as to establish usable
and desirable lots and satisfactory street grades.
(4) Proposed street arrangements shall make provisions for
continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas; the proper
projection of streets into adjoining undeveloped or unplanned
areas; and the continuation of proposed streets to the boundaries
of the tract being subdivided.
(5) New half or partial streets shall be prohibited except where
essential to the reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance
with the other requirements and standards of these regulations and
where, in addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication of the
remaining part of the street can be obtained; a cul-de-sac shall be
constructed at the end of such half street which shall be of a
permanent nature, unless a temporary cul-de-sac is approved.
(6) Names of new streets shall not duplicate or conflict with existing or
planned street names, or approximate such names by the use of
suffixes. Cognizance should be given to existing or planned street
names within the postal delivery district served by the local post
office. New streets shall bear the same name or number of any
continuation of alignment with an existing or planned street.
(7) Proposed private streets (streets not offered for dedication to the
Township) are prohibited, unless they meet the design standards of
these regulations.
§ 180-502 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-503
1:400
(8) Streets in and bordering a subdivision and or land development
plan shall be coordinated with, and be of such widths and grades
and at such locations so as to accommodate prospective traffic and
facilitate fire and police protection.
(9) Whenever a subdivision or land development abuts a street which
does not meet Township design criteria, the street shall be widened
to meet such criteria and provided with additional right-of-way. The
roadway shall also be provided with curbing, sidewalks, and
drainage facilities as prescribed herein.
(10) Where a lot has more than one side of street frontage and there is a
driveway on one side, if it is necessary to determine which side of
the lot fronts for purposes of this chapter, the lot shall be
considered to front on the street on which the driveway exists. In
all other cases, the lot shall be considered to front on the street
which the lot has the greatest frontage. If the lot frontage and
driveway are not determinative, the lot shall be considered to front
on the predominant street bordering the lot.
B. Street classification. Six functional classifications of streets and
roadways are defined by the Lower Paxton Township Comprehensive
Plan to include interstate, freeway, principal and minor arterials,
collectors and local streets. Of these classifications, freeways do not
exist in the Township, and interstates are not addressed by this article
given that these roadways are under the jurisdiction of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and do not typically involve
design activities associated with subdivision and land development
applications. Also, for purposes of this chapter, local streets shall also
be referred to as "minor streets." The following classifications
represent roadways within the Township that are regulated by the
provisions of this chapter:
(1) Arterial. This classification includes highways which provide
intracounty or intermunicipal traffic with volumes greater than
5,000 vehicles per day. Generally, these highways should
accommodate design speeds of 55 miles per hour. The following is a
list of those streets and roadways, which for the purposes of this
chapter, are classified as arterial streets. Newly planned streets
meeting this classification shall be designed to meet arterial street
design criteria.

(2) Collector. This classification is intended to include those highways
which connect minor streets to arterial highways and serve as
traffic corridors connecting residential areas with commercial,
industrial, shopping and other services. They may also penetrate
residential areas. Generally, these highways experience traffic
volumes between 1,000 to 5,000 vehicles per day and shall be
designed to accommodate design speeds of 35 miles per hour. The
following is a list of those streets and roadways, for purposes of this
chapter that are classified as collector streets. Newly planned
streets meeting this classification shall be designed to meet
collector street design criteria.

(3) Minor. This classification is intended to include streets and roads
that provide direct access to abutting land and connections to
higher classes of roadways. Traffic volumes are less than 1,000
vehicles per day and travel distance is generally short. These
streets and roads shall be designed for speeds of 25 miles per hour.
For purposes of this chapter, all roadways not classified as
collector, arterial or above are classified as minor streets. Newly
planned streets meeting this classification shall be designed to
meet minor street design criteria.
(4) A map of the Township road network is enclosed in Exhibit 9.36
C. Street width.
(1) Minimum street right-of-way and cartway widths shall be required
as presented in Table 503.1. Alternate street design types may be
entertained at the sole discretion of the Township under the
modification of requirements procedure based upon the type and
intensity of the development proposed, the merits of the proposed
alternative and a complete technical evaluation of all relevant
information.
(2) Provisions for additional street width (cartway and right-of-way)
including for private streets may be required when determined to
be necessary by the Board of Supervisors in specific cases for:
(a) Public safety and convenience.
(b) Parking in commercial and industrial areas and in areas of
highdensity development.

SAMD HMA  Superpave asphalt mix design, hot mix asphalt
D. Street pavement construction and drainage.
(1) All streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
the latest edition of PennDOT Publication 408, Specifications, and
PennDOT Publication 72M, Standards for Roadway Construction.
Reference is made to Article VIII, Improvement and Construction
Requirements, of this chapter for additional requirements.
(2) All street pavement structures shall be constructed using
Superpave asphalt mix design (SAMD), hot mix asphalt (HMA)
paving materials to the minimum thicknesses and proportions as
referenced herein, subject however to the provisions contained in
§ 180-503D(3) below. Applicants shall be required to submit
estimates of average daily traffic (ADT) volumes for both site
generated traffic and for estimated pass through traffic from
adjacent developed and undeveloped land in order to determine the
roadway classification and SRL designation. Alternate pavement
types such as concrete, brick pavers and the like may be approved
by the Township under the modification of requirements process,
either in part or in its entirety, based upon a thorough technical
review of the proposed alternative as submitted by the applicant.
(3) A pavement design, in accordance with the current edition of
PennDOT Publication 242, Pavement Policy Manual, shall be
required for all new and improved roadways that will accommodate
a total of 100 or more equivalent 18-kip single-axle loads (ESALS)
in a given weekday in all directions. The pavement design
parameters will be determined by the applicant's consultant and
approved by the Township Engineer and shall take into account the
supporting road networks' capacity to handle additional heavy
vehicle loading. No proposed pavement section determined by the
pavement design may be less than the minimum requirements
contained in Table 503.1 of this article.
(4) If poor subgrade soils are present, the Township may require that
the applicant conduct a subgrade soils evaluation for new,
reconstructed and widened streets.
(a) This evaluation shall include, at a minimum:
[1] Gradation test to determine the percent of given particle
sizes of the different soil types of the project. Gradation
test results shall be used to determine the unified soils
classification for the subgrade material.
[2] In-place moisture content and optimum moisture content.
§ 180-503 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-503
1:406
[3] In-place density and dry mass density.
[4] California bearing ratio (CBR).
(b) These tests shall be performed on the existing subgrade
material (in-situ soils) upon which the proposed streets will be
built. Select borrow materials placed as part of the street
construction must also be tested prior to the placement of the
pavement. Stabilization measures will be required as part of
the project if the tested CBR values are equal to or less than
five. Under no circumstances will in-situ subgrade soils or
select borrow materials with a CBR equal to or less than three
to be used for street construction.
(c) The exact number of tests required will be determined at the
discretion of the Township Engineer, given the size of the
proposed project, the location of the proposed street system
and existing soil conditions. At a minimum three representative
tests will be required. All test locations must be approved by
the Township Engineer and must be documented by the
applicant.
(5) Where a new subdivision or land development proposes a street
system that ties into an existing street with a substandard
pavement section, cross slope or exhibits rutting, cracking, base
failure or other poor qualities, the Township may require the
applicant to apply remedial measures to the streets within and
bordering the subject property in order to provide proper access to
the site and to accommodate prospective traffic. Required remedial
measures may include, but shall not be limited to, milling and
overlaying, placement of HMA scratch or leveling courses, crack
sealing or crack repair, select base repair, sawcutting and
pavement replacement or even pavement reconstruction. At the
time of filing the preliminary plan, or in the absence of a
preliminary plan, then the final plan, the applicant shall evaluate
the condition of the existing pavement and the Township shall
determine the need for any remedial work.
(6) All streets shall be provided with a complete storm sewer collection
and conveyance system designed in accordance with the provisions
of Chapter 170, Stormwater Management, Drainage and Erosion
Control.
(7) Pavement base drains shall be designed and installed on all new,
reconstructed, and widened streets to drain subsurface water
beneath the pavement structure. Pavement base drains shall
comply with the construction requirements as contained in Article
VIII of this chapter. Combination storm sewer/underdrain may be
used in lieu of base drain wherever a conflict exists between the
proposed base drain and proposed storm sewer system.
E. Off-street parking.
§ 180-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-503
1:407
(1) Private parking lots and associated access drives for commercial,
institutional, and industrial uses and for multifamily residential
facilities shall be paved in accordance with the following minimum
standard:
1" depth, SAMD HMA wearing course.
2" depth, SAMD HMA binder course.
6" depth, PennDOT No. 2A crushed aggregate base course.
Engineering judgment shall be applied in all instances in
determining the required pavement thickness based upon traffic
volumes, vehicle loadings, and soil conditions specific to the site
being developed.
(2) Alternate designs with an equal or greater structural number will
be considered by the Township.
(3) Any and all portions of driveways within the public right-of-way
accessing parking areas shall conform to the construction
standards listed herein.
F. Cul-de-sac or dead-end streets.
(1) Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as cul-de-sac
streets or for future access to adjoining properties.
(2) Any dead-end street, for access to any adjoining property or
because of an authorized phased development, shall be provided
with a temporary cul-de-sac, within the subdivision or land
development; and shall be provided with a temporary easement
guaranteed for public use until such time as the street is extended
and dedicated to the Township for public use. Temporary culs-desac
shall be paved with a minimum of six inches of PennDOT No. 2A
subbase material and two inches of either HMA binder or wearing
course. The minimum diameter of temporary culs-de-sac shall be
80 feet.
(3) The maximum length of a dead end street or cul-de-sac shall be no
more than 600 feet and shall not furnish access to more than 20
residential dwelling units.
(4) The minimum length of a cul-de-sac street shall be 250 feet.
(5) The length of a cul-de-sac shall be measured from the face of the
curb of the nearest intersecting street at the open end of the cul-desac
street to the center point of the bulb of the cul-de-sac.
(6) Culs-de-sac shall be fully paved to Township standards for the
respective street classification.
(7) "Eyebrow" protrusions and "hammerhead" type turnarounds are
prohibited on all streets as a type of cul-de-sac.
§ 180-503 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-503
1:408
(8) A second cul-de-sac shall not branch off of or intersect from a culde-
sac street.
(9) Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to the tract
boundary with sufficient additional width provided along the
boundary line to permit extension of the street at full width.
(10) A minimum of two locations, evenly spaced around the cul-de-sac
bulb shall be signed as no parking areas to allow for snow storage.
The restricted areas shall be a minimum of 30 feet in length and
generally opposite from the entrance portion of the cul-de-sac and
shall extend from the curbline of the cul-de-sac to the right-of-way
line. The areas shall be kept free of driveways, mailboxes,
landscaping, light standards, fire hydrants and other features that
would be adversely impacted by the plowing and accumulation of
snow and ice. Said restriction areas shall be clearly labeled and
noted on the plan.
(11) Drainage of cul-de-sac streets shall preferably be towards the open
end. If drainage is toward the closed end it shall be collected and
piped away in an underground storm sewer system. Provision shall
also be made for the overland conveyance of stormwater from
storm events of greater frequency for that which the storm sewer
system has been designed.
(12) The center line grade on a cul-de-sac street shall not exceed 10%,
and the grade of the diameter of the turnaround portion of the culde-
sac shall not exceed 5.0%. The minimum grade of the cul-de-sac
bulb shall be 1.0% along both the center line and curbline.
(13) Cul-de-sac streets serving commercial and/or industrial uses shall
be adequate for the type of use to be serviced as approved by the
Township Engineer but in no case shall exceed 800 feet in length.
(14) Interior planting islands within the cul-de-sac turnaround area are
required; however, a perpetual maintenance agreement is required
and shall be implemented to the satisfaction of the Township. The
agreement shall provide a guarantee for the maintenance and
replacement of all planting materials and other facilities. Where
islands are provided, the design shall accommodate access and
circulation for the largest anticipated vehicle and for emergency
access assuming on-street parking of vehicles.
G. Alleyways.
(1) Alleyways shall not be permitted as an acceptable form of street
within the Township unless specifically authorized by the Board of
Supervisors in conjunction with the design and approval of a
Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) in accordance with
the provisions of the Lower Paxton Township Zoning Ordinance. If
authorized, alleyways shall be privately owned and maintained; be
§ 180-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-503
1:409
located within an easement or right-of-way having a minimum
width of 20 feet; have a minimum cartway width of 15 feet; meet
the paving standards for Minor Streets as contained herein; and
be reviewed and approved by the Township Engineer regarding all
other design aspects.
H. Street alignment.
(1) Streets shall be logically related to the terrain and topography so
as to produce usable roads with reasonable alignments and grades.
(2) Horizontal street alignments shall be measured along the center
line. Horizontal circular curves shall be used for all changes in
direction and shall have minimum center line radii as shown in the
following table for each street classification:

(3) Straight portions of the street must be tangent to the beginning or
ending of curves and there must be a tangent length of at least 50
feet at all intersections unless the street is superelevated then
sufficient separation must be provided for proper superelevation
transition. For curves on arterials and collector streets, proper
superelevation must be provided as required by the Township and
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Broken-back and
compound curves shall be prohibited.
(4) Proper stopping sight distance must be provided with respect to
horizontal and vertical alignment, measured along the center line,
from the height of the driver's eye (3.5 feet above grade) to the
height of an object on the roadway (2.0 feet). See the following

(1) Private driveways on corner lots shall be located at least 40 feet
from the nearest edge of the driveway to the point of intersection of
the nearest edge of pavement or cartway.
(2) Driveways shall intersect streets only at right angles.
(3) Driveways shall not be located closer than five feet from an inlet or
fire hydrant.
(4) Where driveways access a curbed street, the driveway opening
shall contain a depressed curb with a minimum of 1 1/2 inch curb
reveal across the required width of the driveway. At each end of the
driveway opening a two-foot curb transition to full height curbing
shall be provided.
(5) All driveways shall be located, designed and constructed in such a
manner as not to interfere or be inconsistent with the design,
maintenance and drainage of streets or the safe and convenient
passage of traffic. The number of driveways shall be kept to a
minimum necessary to serve the intended use. Multiple driveways
for one lot shall be prohibited unless it can be demonstrated that
such arrangement is necessary for safe and efficient traffic flow,
capacity or unless multiple driveways are necessary to comply with
other provisions of this chapter.
(6) No single private driveway shall serve more than six single-family
residential units. A parking lot may serve more than six residential
units; however, any parking lot that serves more than 24 residential
units shall have a minimum of two points of access to a public
street. The two points of access must, at a minimum, be
constructed to a width of 24 feet with radii designed to
accommodate the largest anticipated vehicles.
(7) No shared driveways shall be approved except where governed by
a recorded easement agreement at a minimum setting forth
maintenance requirements, cross access provisions, cost sharing,
and the like. Said easements must also be reflected graphically on
an approved subdivision or land development plan. Shared
§ 180-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-503
1:411
driveways shall have a minimum width of 15 feet and a maximum
width of 24 feet.
(8) All new private driveways must be paved for a minimum distance of
50 feet from the street right-of-way line with a bituminous surface
material, concrete, brick pavers or other material acceptable to the
Township. Stone, gravel, sand, dirt or other similar type driveways
shall be prohibited. The minimum paving standard for bituminous
driveways shall be six inches of PennDOT No. 2A subbase material
and 2 1/2 inches of HMA wearing course. The minimum paving
standard for concrete driveways shall be six inches of PennDOT No.
2A subbase material and six inches of concrete. Brick pavers shall
be designed for a single axle truck wheel load condition. Driveways
within the right-of-way area must be paved to meet Township street
paving requirements for the adjoining street classification.
(9) Residential driveways shall not be less than 12 feet in width or
more than 24 feet in width within 15 feet of the street right-of-way
line except however; for single-family residential structures having
three car garages then the maximum width may be increased to 30
feet; provided, however, that no more than 30% of the development
shall contain driveways wider than 24 feet.
(10) Driveways shall not exceed a slope of 20% and shall have a leveling
area adjacent to the street sufficient to accommodate the change of
grade. Driveways that serve properties which are lower than the
adjacent roadway must be provided with a vertical alignment that
prohibits the collection of stormwater from the street into the
driveway and property area.
(11) Where driveways enter a property through an embankment
condition, a retaining wall of adequate design shall be provided, or
in lieu thereof, the side slopes of the cut slope shall be graded to no
more than one-foot vertical to two feet horizontal. Grading in the
vicinity of the adjacent street shall be such that required sight
distance is provided. Lot and driveway grading shall be conducted
such that storm drainage and soil erosion do not adversely impact
adjacent streets.
J. Street intersections.
(1) Streets shall be laid out to intersect at right angles.
(2) Intersections involving the junction of more than two streets are
prohibited.
(3) Boulevard type streets or intersections having a center landscaped
island, traffic separators, traffic calming devices or other style
medians shall be prohibited unless a perpetual maintenance
agreement is provided and implemented which shall, to the
satisfaction of the Township, provide a guarantee for maintenance
and replacement of all such areas.
§ 180-503 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-503
1:412
(4) Streets intersecting another street shall either intersect directly
opposite to each other, or shall be separated by the following
distances as measured along the center line of the street being
intersected.
Intersecting Street
Minimum Separation Distance
(feet)
Arterial 800
Collector 600
Minor or private street 300
(5) Intersections shall be approached on all sides by a straight leveling
area, the grade of which shall not exceed 4% within 60 feet of the
intersection of the nearest street right-of-way line.
(6) Unless required to accommodate larger vehicles, the curb or edge
of pavement radii at the intersections of streets shall not be less
than the following:
Intersection
Minimum Simple Curve Radii
(feet)
Collector with collector
street
35
Collector with minor
street
25
Minor street with minor

Radius corners must be provided on the property lines
substantially concentric with the curb radius.
(7) Where required to accommodate turning movements for larger
vehicles, three centered compound curves along curblines shall be
permitted upon review and approval of the Township Engineer. In
the design of compound curves, the ratio of the flatter radius to the
sharper radius should not exceed 1.50. Sudden changes between
curves of widely different radii shall be prohibited.
(8) Curb cuts and sidewalk ramps must be provided at all corners of
intersections, access to building sites and at other locations
deemed appropriate by the Township in order to provide
accessibility in accordance with the latest requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
(9) Where required by the Township, the applicant may be required to
provide a turning analysis, turning templates or other similar
efforts to demonstrate that street and driveway intersections have
§ 180-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-503
1:413
been properly designed to accommodate larger and/or emergency
vehicles.
K. Intersection sight distance and clear sight triangles.
(1) Adequate intersection stopping sight distance shall be provided at
all intersections of streets, and for driveways intersecting a street.
All intersections shall be designed to provide required sight
distance with regard to both horizontal and vertical alignment in
accordance with "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and
Streets," American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), current edition. Applicants
shall provide field-measured available sight distances at all
proposed intersections onto existing roadways for all turning
movements and provide a report documenting the method of
computation and the available and required sight distance at all
locations. Said analysis and report must be certified by a
professional engineer. For purposes of analysis and design, the
posted speed limit of the intersecting street shall be used in the
computation of required sight distance unless operating speeds
exceed posted speeds by greater than 10 miles per hour, at which
time the operating speed (85th percentile speed) shall be used.
Based upon traffic patterns and roadway operations, the Township
may require the applicant to conduct a speed study to document
the 85th percentile speed if in the opinion of the Township a study
is required. Exhibit 837 depicts required intersection sight
distances for a typical two lane minor road, stop condition with 3%
grades or less. Other conditions must be computed in accordance
with the above requirements.
(2) If the minimum required intersection sight distance cannot be
achieved, the applicant shall be responsible for either relocating
the site's access point to provide adequate sight distance,
restricting turning movements, if applicable, or by making
improvements such as regrading, roadway reconstruction or
similar measures in order to provide adequate sight distance in
order to meet the requirements of this chapter.
(3) Adequate clear sight triangles (areas of unobstructed view) shall be
provided at all intersections of streets, and for driveways (except
single family residential driveways) intersecting a street. The sight
triangle shall be formed by measuring along the center line of the
cartway or driveway, from the point of intersection of the two
streets, a distance as shown in the following table for the
respective classification of the street, forming each leg of the
triangle. The sight triangle is then formed by connecting the
endpoints. Structures, vegetation, grading and other obstructions
in excess of 24 inches in height shall be prohibited within the clear
sight triangle. Clear sight triangles shall be depicted on all
37.Editor's Note: Exhibit 8 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 180-503 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-503
1:414
subdivision and land development plans for all street and driveway
intersections. Exhibit 838 depicts the typical configuration of clear
sight triangles.
Intersecting Street

(4) If the minimum sight distance can only be achieved by a line of
sight across lands which are not public street right-of-way, a clear
sight easement shall be established on the plan and/or recorded on
each deed for all affected properties. The easement shall prohibit
the placement or existence of structures, vegetation or change of
grade, in excess of 24 inches in height within the clear sight zone.
The easement shall establish the right of the Township to enter
onto the property to clear obstructions, to trim or otherwise restore
the area to meet the required sight distance at the property
owner's expense if after being notified by the Township to remove
obstructions, the property owner has failed to respond in a timely
fashion.
L. Street grades.
(1) The center line grades of streets shall not be less than the minimum
or more than the maximum requirements listed below:
(a) The minimum center line grade or longitudinal slope at the
curbline shall be 1%.
(b) Center line grades shall not exceed the following:
Street Classification Maximum Center Line Grade
Arterial 6%
Collector 8%
Minor or private street 10%
(2) Vertical curves shall be provided at all changes in grade and shall
be designed in relation to the extent of the grade change and to
provide the proper minimum stopping sight distance with respect
to vertical alignment by using the following minimum K values as

shall also include features which are dedicated or designed in
conjunction with the Greenway Plan.
E. Access easements shall have a minimum width of 20 feet and shall be
designed to accommodate the ingress, egress, and regress for the
intended purpose.
F. Utility easements shall be provided as prescribed by the individual
utility company depending upon the purpose and use of the easement.
Where an existing utility easement exists within a subdivision or land
development and construction activity is proposed within said
easement, the applicant shall obtain written approval from the utility
owner authorizing the construction activity as proposed.
G. Wherever possible such utility and drainage easements shall be
centered on the side or rear lot lines of properties.
H. No buildings or other structures, fences, landscaping, walls or
obstructions shall be permitted within easement areas. Additionally, no
change of grade beyond that approved by the Township shall occur
within the easement area.
I. Where a subdivision and/or land development is traversed by a water
course, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a
drainage easement, to a width to be approved by the Township
Engineer, conforming substantially with the line of such water course,
for the purpose of maintaining the unimpeded natural flow, widening,
deepening, relocating, improving or protecting such drainage facilities
or for the purpose of installing drainage facilities. Under no
circumstances shall the easement be less than 25 feet in width and shall
extend outward a minimum of 10 feet from the top of each bank.
J. All easements shall be graphically depicted on the subdivision or land
development plans and shall clearly indicate the location, width,
purpose and beneficiary of the proposed easement. Easements that will
be conveyed to the Township shall be provided with metes and bounds
descriptions tied to the property lines of the property which is
encumbered by said easement.
K. Where drainage easements are depicted on private property for the
benefit of Lower Paxton Township, it shall be construed to mean that
said easement is for access to and maintenance of said facility only in
the event that the landowner fails to maintain said easement and the

§ 180-505. Blocks.
§ 180-506. Building lots.
operation of the facility contained within said easement area is
malfunctioning, is adversely effecting adjacent or downstream
properties or is crucial for the overall public safety and welfare of
the residents of the Township. The Township will not own or maintain
stormwater or other facilities unless otherwise specifically governed by
operation of an agreement.
A. The length, width, shape, and design of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to the provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type
proposed, to the land use and/or zoning requirements of the Township,
the topography of the land being subdivided or developed, and the
requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation.
B. Blocks shall not exceed 1,600 feet in length, nor be less than 300 feet in
length as measured between the center lines of the intersecting streets.
C. Residential blocks shall generally be of sufficient depth to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots
bordering an arterial or collector street are used or, where due to the
contour of the land or the necessary layout of the subdivision, there is
insufficient depth between intersecting streets for such two-tier design.
D. Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the elements
of design contained in this Section if the nature of the use requires
other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for employees and
customers shall be provided along with safe and convenient limited
access to the street system. Space for off-street loading shall also be
provided with limited access to the street system. Extension of streets,
railroad access rights-of-way, and utilities shall be provided as
necessary.
A. General standards.
(1) The size, depth, width and orientation of lots shall conform to
applicable zoning regulations of Lower Paxton Township.
(2) Side lot lines shall, in so far as practical, run perpendicular or
radial from the street right-of-way line.
(3) Where feasible, lot lines should follow municipal boundaries rather
than cross them, in order to avoid jurisdictional problems.
(4) All lots shall be provided with sewer and water service either public
or private in accordance with Township zoning requirements for
the applicable zoning district and for lot size requirements.
(5) If, after subdividing, remnants of land exist, they shall be either:

(b) Legally dedicated to public use, if acceptable to the Township,
or dedicated to a homeowner's association or similar entity.
B. Lot frontage.
(1) All building lots shall abut an existing or proposed public street.
Flag lots shall not be permitted as a form of lot layout within the
Township.
(2) Double or reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited except where
required to provide separation of residential development from
collector or arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages
of topography or orientation.
(3) No residential lots shall be created which front upon a limited
access highway. Furthermore, no major subdivision and/or land
developments shall be created which front upon an arterial street.
A. General.
(1) Adequate site lighting as described herein shall be required in all
subdivisions and land developments. These lighting requirements
provide appropriate standards to ensure adequate nighttime safety
and security while minimizing the spillover of light and glare on
operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, adjacent properties and
other land uses near the light source.
(2) General requirements. Exterior lighting shall be provided along
public and private streets, in parking areas, pedestrian sidewalks
and walkways and nonresidential driveway intersections in
accordance with the standards contained herein and in Zoning
Ordnance Article V, § 203-507. Lighting used for security purposes
shall also conform to the same standards.
(3) Applicability. Outdoor lighting shall be required for safety and
personal security in areas of public assembly and traverse;
including but not limited to, single-family and multifamily dwelling
unit developments, commercial, industrial, public recreational and
institutional uses. In addition to the minimum placement
requirements, the Board of Supervisors may require lighting to be
incorporated for other uses or locations as they deem necessary.

D. Fixture design.
(1) Fixtures shall be of a type and design appropriate to the lighting
application, and aesthetically acceptable to the Township.
(2) For areas such as parking lots, full-cutoff-type fixtures shall be
used.
(3) Fixtures shall be equipped with or be capable of being backfitted
with light-directing devices such as shields, visors or hoods when
necessary to redirect offending light distribution.
E. Control of nuisance and disabling glare.
(1) All outdoor lighting, whether or not required by this chapter; on
private, residential, commercial, industrial, municipal, recreational
or institutional property; shall be aimed, located, designed, fitted
and maintained so as not to present a disabling glare hazard to
drivers or pedestrians, or a nuisance glare concern to neighboring
properties.
(2) Directional fixtures such as floodlights, spotlights and sign lights,
shall be installed or aimed so that they do not shine directly into the
window of a neighboring residence, directly into a roadway, or
skyward.
(3) Flickering, flashing or strobe-type lights shall not be permitted.
(4) Light sources or luminaries shall not be located within buffer yard
areas except for lighting pedestrian walkways.
(5) Unless otherwise permitted by the Board of Supervisors, lighting
shall be controlled by automatic switching devices such as timers,
motion detectors and/or photocells, to extinguish offending sources
between 11:00 p.m. and dawn, to mitigate glare and sky-lighting
consequences.
(6) Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary
means for controlling glare. Rather, such control shall be achieved
primarily through the use of full-cutoff fixtures, the appropriate
application of mounting height, wattage, aiming angle, fixture
§ 180-507 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-507
1:422
placement and fixture design, etc. and the additions of shields and
baffles as necessary.
(7) The amount of illumination projected onto another property shall
not exceed 0.10 horizontal footcandles at the property line for
adjacent residential uses and 0.50 horizontal footcandles at the
property line for adjacent commercial and industrial uses.
(8) Externally illuminated signs shall be lighted by fixtures mounted at
the top of the sign and aimed down rather than by fixtures mounted
at the bottom of the sign and aimed up.
F. Installation.
(1) Lighting fixtures shall not be mounted in excess of 20 feet above
the adjacent grade for residential projects, 35 feet above the
adjacent grade for commercial projects; and 40 feet above the
adjacent grade for industrial projects.
(2) Electrical feeds to lighting standards shall run underground, not
overhead.
(3) Lighting standards in public parking areas shall be placed a
minimum of three feet outside the paved area; or three feet behind
curblines or tire stop locations; or on reinforced concrete pedestals
a minimum of 18 inches in diameter and at least 30 inches high
above the pavement grade, or by other acceptable protective
means approved by the Township Engineer.
G. Ownership and maintenance.
(1) Lighting fixtures on private property shall be owned and
maintained by the property owner so as to always meet the
requirements of this chapter. Once approved and installed, no
changes to fixture type, wattage, illumination angle or other
modifications shall be permitted that violate the provisions of this
chapter.
(2) Generally, streetlights located within the public street right-of-way
shall be owned and maintained by the local utility company having
jurisdiction. Where applicable, the Township may require the
applicant to enter into an agreement with said utility company
regarding the payment of all costs and fees for the installation of
streetlighting facilities.
(3) If specifically approved by the Township under a development
agreement with the applicant, the Township may, under special
circumstances, allow privately owned and maintained
streetlighting facilities within the street right-of-way line.
H. Plan submission.
§ 180-507 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-507
1:423
(1) Lighting plans submitted to the municipality for review and
approval shall include a layout of the proposed fixture locations;
isofootcandle plots that demonstrate adequate intensities and
uniformity; and manufacturers' catalog cuts that present a
description of the equipment, including glare-reduction devices,
lamps, switching devices, mounting heights and mounting methods
proposed. All proposed development plans shall, at the time of
preliminary plan submittal, include lighting plans indicating
proposed placement of all lighting fixtures incorporated with the
above-referenced specifications. The lighting plans shall also
provide an engineering detail of standards, foundations, fixtures as
well as information on the manufacturer, model, and installation
techniques.
(2) Fixture location/placement. The following are minimum
requirements for placement of street and/or site lighting fixtures
within or adjacent to new subdivisions or land developments:
(a) All intersections involving existing or proposed collector public
streets within or adjacent to the proposed development.
(b) Along all existing or proposed collector streets within or
adjacent to the proposed development at intervals sufficient to
provide the desired lighting levels referenced herein.
(c) All terminal ends of center median islands having concrete
curbing, trees, and/or other fixed objects not having a
breakaway design for speeds of 25 miles per hour or greater.
(d) Any/all defined pedestrian crossings shown on the approved
plans (or required by the Township) located within the
development or along existing roads abutting the development
with said crossing located in areas other than lighted
intersections.
(e) Any signalized intersection abutting the proposed
development.
(f) Any new traffic signal installation required by the proposed
development.
(g) Within private parking lots and along aisleways and access
drives to provide the required lighting levels referenced
herein.
(h) Building access points.
I. Compliance monitoring.
(1) If the Township judges that a lighting installation creates a safety
or personal security hazard, the person(s) responsible for the
lighting shall be notified and requested to take timely remedial
action.
§ 180-507 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-507
1:424
§ 180-508. Sidewalks and pedestrian pathways.
(2) Measurement. For all measurements regarding compliance,
lighting levels shall be measured in footcandles. Measurement
shall be taken with a direct reading portable light meter or other
light-reading equipment recommended by the Township Engineer.
(3) Method. Readings shall be taken by qualified personnel so that the
light reading meter has been exposed long enough to provide a
constant reading. Measurements shall be made after dark with the
light sources in question on, then with the same sources off. The
difference between the two readings shall be compared to the
maximum permitted illumination at the property line at ground
level. This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight and other
ambient light.
J. Nuisance glare and inadequate illumination levels.
(1) When the Township judges that an installation produces
unacceptable levels of nuisance glare or skyward light or that
illumination levels are insufficient or not being maintained in
accordance with this chapter, the Township shall cause notification
of the person(s) responsible for the lighting and require remedial
action.
(2) Nonconforming lighting. Any lighting fixture, including the bulb(s),
existing as of the effective date of this chapter which does not
conform with the requirements of this chapter shall be considered
a lawful, nonconforming lighting fixture. A nonconforming lighting
fixture shall be made to comply with the requirements of this
chapter when such fixture is replaced, relocated or repaired.
K. Exemption for specified uses.
(1) Because of their unique requirements for nighttime visibility and
their limited hours of operation, public and private recreational
uses such as ball diamonds, playing fields, tennis courts and
volleyball courts are exempt from the above requirements.
(2) Outdoor public and private recreational uses specified above shall
not exceed a maximum permitted post height of 100 feet above the
adjacent ground surface.
(3) Outdoor public and private recreational uses may exceed a total
cutoff angle of 90°, provided that the luminaire is shielded to
prevent light and glare spillover to adjacent residential uses as
described herein.
A. Requirements.
(1) Sidewalks must be installed along both sides of all new interior
streets in all residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions
§ 180-507 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-508
1:425
and land developments within the Township unless otherwise
waived by the Township. Sidewalks must also be constructed along
the side of all exterior streets upon which the subdivision or land
development fronts. Where sidewalks are required to be installed,
curbing, street widening and drainage improvements must also be
provided.
(2) Sidewalks shall not be waived where, in the Township's opinion, it
is desirable to link sidewalks in existing, adjoining or proposed
developments or where it would be desirable to continue sidewalks
that are existing to provide access to community facilities such as
schools, bus stops, shopping areas, and recreation areas.
(3) The Township may, in its sole discretion, waive the requirements
for sidewalks on one or both sides of the street where alternative,
private pedestrian interior pathways located off of the street rightof-
way are planned and provided or where, in the judgment of the
Township, there are unique circumstances, other hardships or
where the absence of sidewalks better serves the particular needs
of the subdivision or land development.
B. Placement.
(1) All sidewalks must be constructed no closer than four inches to the
street right-of-way line and extend toward the curbline. A grass
planting strip shall be provided between the curb and the sidewalk.
(2) Refer to Article VIII, Improvement and Construction Requirements,
for sidewalk construction specifications.
(3) Maintenance of sidewalks within the street right-of-way shall be
the responsibility of the property owner whose property abuts the
sidewalk.
C. Pedestrian pathways and greenways. If sidewalks are waived in favor of
private pedestrian pathways considered more efficient and desirable to
provide circulation or access within the development, and to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, open spaces and other
facilities then the applicant must provide a plan, accompanying the
waiver request, indicating the layout and arrangement of the proposed
pathways. This provision shall not be construed as a mechanism for
developers to merely parallel street right-of-way lines with pedestrian
pathways, but shall be applied where, owing to unique physical
constraints, development theme or building placement, an on-site
pathway is more advantageous to the Township than a formal sidewalk
system. If authorized, the alternative pedestrian pathway must meet
the following general criteria:
(1) Pathways must be located within a minimum ten-foot-wide access
easement for the benefit of the general public. Access to the public
street system must be provided at regular intervals throughout the
development not exceeding 800 feet.
§ 180-508 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-508
1:426
§ 180-509. Curbing.
§ 180-510. Site excavation and grading.
(2) Pathways must be a minimum width of six feet wide and have a
paved travel surface. The material requirements of the travel
surface for pedestrian paths shall be a minimum of six inches of
PennDOT No. 2A subbase material and 2 1/2 inches of bituminous
wearing surface or an equivalent design approved at the discretion
of the Township Engineer. The surface must be graded to provide
positive drainage at a maximum cross slope of 2%. Longitudinal
slopes shall be designed in accordance with good engineering
practice such that acceptable access by pedestrians of all types can
easily traverse the pathway.
(3) Pathways must be privately owned and maintained under a reliable
arrangement acceptable to the Township, including routine
maintenance, trimming, mowing, snow and ice removal,
overlayment or reconstruction as required.
(4) Pathways must be designed to provide the required handicapped
accessibility along the pathway and at all points of intersection
with public streets.
(5) These features shall be designed in conjunction with the Township
Greenway Plan.
A. Curbing must be installed along both sides of all new interior streets to
the proper street width in all residential, commercial and industrial
subdivisions and land developments within the Township. Curbing,
including pavement widening and drainage improvements must also be
constructed along all exterior streets upon which the property fronts.
B. The Township may waive the requirements for curbing and widening
along frontage roadways either in part or in full where, in the judgment
of the Township, there are unique circumstances or other physical
hardships where the absence of curbing and widening better serves the
particular needs of the subdivision or land development.
C. Where curbing and sidewalk is required at intersections, curb cut
ramps shall be installed to provide access to building sites and at other
locations deemed appropriate by the Township accessibility in
accordance with current ADA requirements.
D. Refer to Article VIII, Improvement and Construction Requirements, for
curb construction specifications.
E. In areas where curbing is not required to be constructed, suitable
shoulders, gutters, swales or ditches must be installed to avoid erosion
and must be of sufficient cross section to permit the proper flow of
stormwater.

A. All proposed site excavation and grading for subdivision and land
development projects shall be clearly depicted on the preliminary and
final plan when filed with the Township for review. Grading associated
with site development activities or areas to be graded outside of street
right-of-way lines shall be clearly depicted by proposed contour lines
and spot elevations as required in this chapter and shall not exceed a
ratio of 2:1 (horizontal to vertical) for cut slopes and 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical) for fill slopes. All excavation and grading shall be governed by
the requirements as contained in PennDOT Publication 408,
Specifications, current edition, regarding suitable soil materials, lift
thickness, compaction criteria, soil testing and related matters. It shall
be the responsibility of the applicant to fully document compliance with
these specifications and to demonstrate the same to the Township upon
request.
A. Each new subdivision or land development shall be provided with
adequate means for sewage disposal and the sewage disposal system
shall be either public, community, or individual on-lot systems owned,
maintained and operated by the owners of each lot. Community sewage
facilities may be located within undivided open space, with appropriate
easements, at the discretion of the Township.
B. As applicable, all preliminary or preliminary/final plan submissions
shall include a completed Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) Sewage Facilities Planning Module for Land
Development on forms provided by DEP. The plan review process shall
not commence until a completed Planning Module or module
exemption, if applicable, has been submitted, including soil test pits
(probes) and soil percolation (perc) test information for each proposed
lot when on-site systems are proposed. The commencement of the
preliminary plan or preliminary/final plan review process shall thus
coincide with the commencement of the Planning Module review
process as outlined below:
(1) Planning Module review shall be in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act of 1965, P.L. 1535, No. 537, as
amended; DEP's Chapter 71 regulations, Administration of Sewage
Facilities; the Township's current Act 537 Plan; provisions for
processing planning modules as outlined in Article III, § 180-303E;
and this and other Township ordinances and regulations.
(2) The developer shall provide the most advanced and highest type of
sanitary sewage disposal facility available consistent with existing
physical, geographical and geological conditions of the site, and in
conformance with all applicable Township, state, county, and
federal ordinances and/or regulations.
(3) Based upon the results of the Planning Module, public, community
or individual on-lot sewage service facilities must be provided.
§ 180-510 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-511
1:428
C. Individual on-lot sewage disposal systems.
(1) Where public sanitary sewers are not planned, readily available or
the applicant is not required to extend an existing public sanitary
sewage system to the subject site based upon the criteria outlined
in § 180-511D(1) below, the use of individual on-lot sewage disposal
systems shall be permitted. The use of such on-lot systems is
governed by regulations of the DEP and enforced by the Township
Sewage Enforcement Officer (SEO).
(2) Prior to the approval of any plan proposing individual on-lot sewage
disposal systems, the applicant shall have conducted proper perc
and probe testing performed on each lot in accordance with DEP
and Township requirements to determine the suitability for such
systems, and shall have secured the approval of the Township SEO
and/or DEP through the use of a Planning Module for Land
Development. Each on-lot sewage disposal system must be
reviewed, inspected and approved by the Township SEO prior to
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the structure.
(3) An individual on-lot sewage disposal system shall be located on the

A. General standards.
(1) Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land
located in any identified floodplain area or district may be planned
for development with the provision that the developer construct all
buildings and structures to preclude flood damage in accordance
with this and any other laws and ordinances regulating such
development. Reference is made to Article V, Environmental
§ 180-513 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-514
1:435
Protection, § 203-504, of the Lower Paxton Township Zoning
Ordinance for Floodplain District Regulations.
(2) Building sites for residences or any other type of dwellings or
accommodations shall not be permitted in any floodplain area
where the elevation of the structure is located below 1 1/2 feet
above the regulatory flood elevation. Where no floodway has been
identified, the structure shall not be located within 50 feet from the
top of bank of any stream or water course unless a detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis is provided by the applicant and
approved by the Township which demonstrates that the floodway is
of a lesser width. If fill is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill
area shall extend out laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet
beyond the limits of any proposed structures.
(3) All proposed subdivisions and land developments shall provide the
location of all regulatory floodplain areas clearly delineated on the
plan. Subdivision plans and other land development plans
proposing 50 or more lots or dwelling units or containing greater
than 20 acres, whichever is lesser, shall include actual 100-year
base flood elevation data, in an acceptable engineering form
comparable to United States Army Corps of Engineers, HEC-RAS,
which shall be certified as accurate by a professional engineer. The
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis shall include the entire property
from the upstream to downstream limits of all major waterways.
(4) No new construction or development shall be permitted within a
designated floodway of a stream or waterway. When the applicant
is proposing encroachments into floodplain areas associated with a
subdivision or land development application said encroachment
shall only be permitted when in compliance with this and other
ordinances and approved by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP). Where the applicant is proposing
to modify an existing floodplain as defined by a Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Study, the applicant
shall be responsible for performing all studies, data collection,
analysis and preparing applications for the Township's review and
approval in order to secure a letter of map revision (LOMR) for the
designated waterway. The limits of the study shall be determined in
consultation with the Township and FEMA.
(5) Buildings sites for structures or buildings other than for residential
uses shall not be permitted in any identified floodway area or
district. Also, such sites for structures or buildings outside the
floodway shall be protected as provided for in § 180-514A(2) above.
However, the Board of Supervisors may allow the subdivision and/
or land development of areas or sites for commercial and industrial
uses at an elevation below the regulatory flood elevation if the
applicant otherwise protects the area to that height or assures that
the buildings or structures will be floodproofed at least up to that
height.
§ 180-514 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-514
1:436
(6) When an applicant does not intend to develop the plan himself and
the Township determines that additional controls are required to
insure safe development, it may require the applicant to impose
appropriate plan and deed restrictions on the land. Such deed
restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and noted on every
recorded plan.
(7) Where any excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing
trees, shrubs or other vegetative cover will be removed, the
developer shall consult the Dauphin County Conservation District
representative concerning plans for erosion and sedimentation
control and to also obtain a report on the soil characteristics of the
site so that a determination can be made as to the type and degree
of development the site may accommodate. Before undertaking any
excavation or grading, the applicant shall obtain all necessary
permits and approvals from the Township.
(8) Drainage facilities. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to
convey the flow of stormwater runoff in a safe and efficient manner.
The system shall ensure proper drainage along streets, and provide
positive drainage away from buildings. Stormwater conveyance
facilities may be located within floodplain areas however;
stormwater management facilities and other best management
practice (BMP) areas shall not be located within any floodplain
areas of the Township. Plans shall be subject to the approval of the
Township.
(9) The Township may require a primarily underground storm system
to accommodate frequent floods and secondary surface system to
accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be
consistent with local and county drainage plans. The facilities shall
be designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent
properties.
(10) Street and driveways. The finished elevation of proposed streets
and driveways shall not be more than one foot below the regulatory
flood elevation. The Township may require profiles and elevations
of streets to determine compliance with the requirements.
Drainage openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows
without unduly increasing flood heights or damaging the roadway.
(11) Sanitary sewer facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in any
designated floodplain district, whether public or private, shall be
floodproofed to not less than 1 1/2 feet above the regulatory flood
elevation.
(12)Water facilities. All water systems located in any designated
floodplain district, whether public or private, shall be floodproofed
to not less than 1 1/2 feet above the regulatory flood elevation.
§ 180-514 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-514
1:437
§ 180-515. Landscaping design standards.
(13) Other utilities and facilities. All other public and private utilities
including gas and electric shall be elevated or floodproofed to not
less than 1 1/2 feet above the regulatory flood elevation.
A. General.
(1) The landscaping design requirements contained within this section
shall be applicable to all subdivision and land development
applications that require buffer yards and screen plantings
pursuant to the Lower Paxton Township Zoning Ordinance; require
street trees related to the construction of new streets within
subdivisions; propose new parking facilities associated with new
land development activity; and new multifamily, commercial and
industrial buildings associated with new land development activity.
B. Design tandards for screening in required buffer yards.
(1) No plant material within buffer yards will be permitted in situations
where it may inhibit sight distance, conflict with the circulation and
safety of pedestrians, conflict with utility or stormwater facilities,
or create potential maintenance problems.
(2) Screen plantings shall not consist of evergreen plant species only. A
collective landscape design approach must be used to mix and
combine a variety of deciduous shade and ornamental trees and
deciduous and evergreen shrubs and groundcover. Vegetation must
be distributed throughout the entire planting buffer to achieve a
complete coverage of the buffer.
(3) Buffers on man-made slopes shall have a maximum slope of 25%.
(4) One tree shall be provided for every 500 square feet of required
landscape buffer area. Trees shall be mixed evergreen and
deciduous species with no more than 30% of the screen being
composed of deciduous trees. Trees shall have a minimum height of
20 feet at maturity.
(5) Shrubs within buffer areas must be planted such that one shrub is
provided for each 250 square feet of buffer area. Plantings must be
staggered and arranged in combination with the required trees to
achieve a natural and pleasing appearance at maturity. Shrubs
shall be of a species as to provide screening from the ground to a
height of six feet at maturity. The ground area within the buffer
area shall be covered with grass, groundcover or mulch.
(6) Buffers and screening shall be continuous and no parking facilities
or structures of any sort shall be permitted within the landscape
buffer areas. Buffers may be penetrated with driveways and
walkways provided that said penetrations are perpendicular to the
buffer and are minimized.
§ 180-514 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-515
1:438
(7) All landscaped buffer areas shall be kept clean of all debris, litter,
weeds, and tall grasses, and shall otherwise be maintained in good
form by the landowner or other entity in accordance with the
approved plan.
(8) Existing wooded areas may meet the criteria of the requirements of
a buffer yard with the following conditions:
(a) The existing wooded area encompasses the entire required
width of the buffer yard and no change of grade is proposed
within the buffer area.
(b) The existing wooded area is primarily comprised of acceptable
native woody plant species as described in the Native Plant
List published by the Pennsylvania Department of
Conservation and Natural Resources (PA DCNR).
(c) The existing wooded areas consist of a dense, healthy stand of
trees and other desirable vegetative materials and will provide
a buffer equal to or better than the required buffer when
mature.
(d) Supplemental planting may be required to provide the
required number, species mix and visual screening required by
this section.
(e) All invasive and noxious weeds and trees shall be deadened
and removed from the buffer area.
(9) Decorative fencing, walls and earthen berms of adequate height
and slope are encouraged and may be substituted for a portion of
the required landscaping at the sole discretion of the Board of
Supervisors. Fences and walls shall be of a solid design nature and
consist of low maintenance materials which are aesthetically
pleasing for use in a landscaped buffer. Any walls or fencing shall
be constructed to a minimum height of six feet.
C. Design standards for parking lots and perimeters.
(1) In any parking lot containing 30 or more parking spaces (excluding
a parking garage), 5% of the total area of the parking lot shall be
devoted to interior landscaping. Such interior landscaping shall be
used at the end of parking space rows to break up rows of parking
spaces and to help visually define travel lanes within the parking
lot. No more than 20 parking spaces shall be placed in a row
without the use of a landscaped island.
(2) Landscaping areas situated outside of the physical confines of the
parking lot, such as peripheral areas and areas around buildings,
shall not constitute interior landscaping. For purposes of
computing the total area of any parking lot, all areas within the
perimeter of the parking lot shall be counted, including all parking
§ 180-515 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-515
1:439
and loading and unloading spaces, fire lanes, access and drive
aisles, islands, and curbed areas.
(3) Perimeter plantings around parking lots shall also be provided.
Perimeter landscaped areas shall be a minimum of five feet in
width. A minimum of one deciduous or coniferous tree and two
shrubs shall be provided for each 50 feet of parking lot perimeter
provided. The balance of the perimeter shall be composed of
groundcover, grass, perennials, and the like. Earthen berms and
mounds are encouraged to screen the parking area from public
streets or adjacent properties.
(4) Ground cover alone is not sufficient to meet the parking lot
landscaping requirements. A mixed planting design of deciduous
trees, shrubs, and ground cover shall be provided within the
landscaped islands.
(5) The following design requirements shall be adhered to for all
interior landscaping within parking lots:
(a) Landscaping shall be provided within curbed islands having a
minimum width of six feet and a minimum area of 100 square
feet for single depth islands and a minimum width of six feet
and a minimum area of 200 square feet for islands with a depth
equal to two parking spaces.
(b) Each landscaping island must be provided with a minimum of
one deciduous tree plus one shrub per each 100 square feet of
island area with the balance being composed of groundcover
and perennials.
(c) Island plantings must be coordinated with the location and
height of light standards and utility lines such that conflicts do
not exist.
(d) Landscaping materials shall be protected from intrusion by
cars by the use of curbing, bollards, wheel stops or similar
devices.
(e) Plantings within landscaped islands shall be designed to
provide adequate vehicular sight distance within the parking
lot and for any access thereto.
D. Design standards for site area landscaping.
(1) All multifamily, commercial and industrial developments shall be
provided with site landscaping amenities in addition to any
required landscaping for screens, buffer yards, parking lots,
parking lot perimeters, or street trees. Site landscaping shall be
provided for the following general conditions and shall be depicted
on the landscaping plan referenced herein:
(a) Building foundations and building entrance points.
§ 180-515 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-515
1:440
(b) Front and side yard areas of buildings.
(c) Areas along access drives to adjacent streets.
(d) Areas around entrance or development signs.
(2) All required areas shall be landscaped to the satisfaction of the
Township with a combination of trees, shrubs, groundcover,
planting beds, annuals and perennials and other landscape
features in order to compliment the building and provide for a
suitable site design. Grass cover alone will not be sufficient to meet
landscaping requirements of this section.
(3) Service loading and unloading areas shall be landscaped to screen
the view from adjacent streets and properties.
(4) Where the external storage of materials is permitted on the
property, said areas shall be landscaped to screen the view from
adjacent streets and properties.
(5) Trash disposal areas such as dumpsters or compactors shall be
screened so as not to be visible from parking areas, adjacent
streets and properties. Such areas shall be screened with a
combination of architectural masonry or fencing and landscaped
with coniferous shrubs with a height of at least six feet.
(6) Sewage pumping stations, treatment facilities, utility substations
and similar utility structures shall be landscaped to screen the view
from surrounding areas.
E. Design standards for street trees.
(1) Street trees shall be required in all subdivisions and land
developments based on the following:
(a) For existing and new arterial, collector and minor streets, as
defined herein, a quantity of one street tree for every 50 linear
feet of street frontage shall be provided.
(2) Design requirements. The following design guidelines shall be met
unless otherwise stipulated in this chapter.
(a) Street trees shall be planted no closer than 30 feet on center or
farther than 75 feet on center along each side of the street.
(b) All street trees shall be located within the street verge area
and be centered between the back edge of curb and the front
face of the sidewalk unless otherwise approved by the
Township.
(c) No more than 25% of one species of tree shall be planted as
street trees within a development.
§ 180-515 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-515
1:441
(d) If sidewalks are not required, street trees shall be planted four
feet from the back edge of the curb.
(e) The location of street trees shall not be planted within required
clear sight triangles of intersections.
(f) The placement of street trees shall not conflict with the
placement of underground utilities, storm sewer systems, or
other public infrastructure.
(g) Street trees shall not be planted within 10 feet from any storm
drain inlet, fire hydrant, accessible manhole or utility pole or
structure.
(h) Street trees shall be consistent with the procedures and
requirements of the Lower Paxton Township Zoning Ordinance.
(i) The selection of street tree species shall be approved only after
review by the Township Shade Tree Commission. Applicants
are encouraged to meet with the Shade Tree Commission or a
representative thereto during the design process in order to
solicit input on approved species, planting location and other
landscaping design elements.
F. Credit for preservation of existing trees in required buffer yards.
(1) A landscape credit can be applied toward the required buffer yard
plant material for the preservation of existing trees provided said
existing trees are of a quality native species and are in a condition

C. If, after an absence/presence site investigation, it is determined that
there are no wetlands on the subject property and no wetlands will be
impacted off site, then the following certification note must be placed
on the plan:
I, (Name of environmental consultant), hereby certify that I have
conducted a wetlands investigation on (date) in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and have determined that there are no
regulatory wetlands on the subject property; that the proposed project
will not impact any off-site wetlands and that no wetland permits
are required from any state or federal governmental agency having
jurisdiction.
Signature & date
D. If there are regulatory wetlands found on the property and/or wetlands
will be impacted off site, then a wetland delineation report must be
submitted to the Township as part of the required plan submission
materials prepared in accordance with the requirements listed above
and generally including the information required by the USACOE as
part of a jurisdiction determination (JD) review. All regulatory wetlands
must be clearly delineated on the subdivision or land development plan.
If wetlands are proposed to be impacted by project activities, required
wetland mitigation areas and construction details must also be included
with the plan set.
E. A copy of completed permit applications such as a water obstruction
and encroachment permit or general permit from DEP and a Section
404 permit from the USACOE shall be provided to the Township for
review.
F. If necessary, the wetlands may be verified by the Township, Township
Engineer, or their consultants through a site visit.

1:449
§ 180-521. Natural features preservation.
time of inspection. The installation requirements for monuments and
markers are as follows:
B. Monuments must be set as follows:
(1) One monument at each intersection of all public street right-of-way
lines.
(2) The intersections of lines forming angles or changes in direction
along the boundary of the perimeter of the parent tract of land
comprising the subdivision or land development unless said points
are already marked by monuments recognized as established
survey corners or are impractical to set due to streams,
topographic conditions or other similar constraints.
(3) Such other intermediate points as may be required by the Township
Engineer.
C. Markers must be set:
(1) At all corners except those required to be monumented.
(2) Prior to the construction of any building or residential unit on the
property.
D. Monuments and markers shall be the following sizes and made of the
following materials:

inches long. Markers shall be made of iron pipes or iron or steel
reinforcing bars.
E. Monuments and markers must be placed so that the scored or marked
point coincides exactly with the point of intersection of the lines being
monumented. They must be set so that the top of the monument or
marker is level with or within one inch above the finished grade of the
surrounding ground. Monuments must be marked on top with a copper
or brass plate or dowel set in the concrete.
F. Removal. Any monuments or markers that are removed must be
replaced by a professional land surveyor at the expense of the person
requiring the removal and replacement of said monument or marker.
A. All subdivision and land development plans shall be planned and
designed without impact to and destruction of significant natural
features located on the property. Significant natural features shall not
§ 180-520 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-521
1:450
§ 180-522. Dedication of recreation land and fee requirements.
[Amended 4-17-2012 by Ord. No. 12-02]
be physically disturbed or used for any other uses other than public
or private conservation areas and uses for the conservation of open
space, water, soil and wildlife resources; educational facilities of an
environmental nature, and private, passive recreation except to the
extent that it is necessary to provide ingress and egress to a property
or the extension of required utilities into the property where no other
feasible alternative exists. Where access is required through significant
natural features, it shall only be permitted where it can be
demonstrated by the applicant that the design is the least intrusive to
the natural features in question.
B. Significant natural features shall consist of the following elements:
(1) Land areas having a slope equal to or in excess of 25% which are
not the result of man-made changes to the natural terrain.
Excluded from this classification are slopes that are small, isolated
or otherwise occurring as knolls, localized depressions, and the like
which are not environmentally significant.
(2) Regulatory wetland areas as defined in § 180-518.
(3) Areas comprised of rivers, creeks, streams, lakes, dams, ponds, and
other bodies of water or defined watercourses and all land areas
within 25 feet of such features.
C. The requirements of this section shall not be construed to further
restrict any development activity currently permitted by the Township
relating to the use of floodways, flood fringe areas, or approximated
floodplain areas.
D. Slope areas shall be based upon a two-foot contour interval topographic
survey and evaluation of all critical slope areas on the property. The
average natural slope of an area shall be determined by dividing the
horizontal run of the slope into the vertical rise of the same slope and
converting the resulting figure into a percentage value. All slope areas
shall be measured at right angles to the natural contour.
E. Where a subdivision or land development plan contains significant
natural features, conservation easements shall be provided for the
purpose of protecting the natural features from any further
development or destruction.
A. Applicability and intent. All residential subdivision and/or land
development applications submitted to the Township under this chapter
shall provide for suitable and adequate recreation space in order to:
(1) Ensure recreation areas and facilities are adequate to serve the
residents of the Township.
§ 180-521 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-522
1:451
(2) Maintain consistency with the conclusions and recommendations in
the Township's Recreation and Park Plan, the Township's Greenway
Plan and consistency with the Township's Comprehensive Plan
regarding recreation.
(3) Ensure that all residents have the opportunity to engage in varied
recreation activities which includes passive and active forms of
recreation.
(4) Reduce the increasing user pressure on existing recreation areas
and facilities.
(5) Reduce the possibility of overburdening the Township with the
development and maintenance of many small, randomly placed
recreation areas.
(6) Ensure parks and open spaces are designed to conserve sensitive
natural features and are properly integrated into the community.
B. Land dedication versus fee in lieu. The Planning Commission and the
Parks and Recreation Board shall recommend to the Board of
Supervisors whether a land dedication or the payment of fees in lieu
thereof is recommended. This recommendation shall be made at the
time of the preliminary plan review or, in the case of no preliminary
plan, at the final plan review by the Planning Commission and the Parks
and Recreation Board; however, under no circumstances would a park
land dedication or fee in lieu payment be accepted to reduce the
percentage of open space otherwise required under provisions of the
Township Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission shall, at a
minimum, consider the following points in reaching their
recommendation:
(1) Whether the land proposed to be dedicated would serve a valid
public purpose and meet the design requirements of usable
recreation space.
(2) Whether the land proposed to be dedicated meets the standards of
the adopted Lower Paxton Township Recreation and Park Plan.
(3) Recommendations received from the Parks and Recreation Board.
C. Land dedication procedures and requirements. For all residential
subdivision and land development plans, the amount of land required to
be dedicated to the Township for public recreational purposes shall be
as follows:
(1) Residential subdivision and/or land development requirements. A
minimum area of 1,024 square feet (0.0235 acres) per dwelling unit
shall be provided as part of a contiguous, usable area that is
contiguous to and may be combined with an existing municipal
park and recreational facility.
§ 180-522 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-522
1:452
(2) Time requirements. Land to be dedicated to the Township must be
dedicated for public use immediately after the recording of the final
plan phase upon which the dedicated parcel is located. The
proposed deed of dedication shall include a legal description and
plat of the area and shall be submitted with the final plan for
approval by the Township Solicitor. Title to land to be dedicated
shall be good and marketable and free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances or other defects as demonstrated by a current title
report or a legal opinion of title provided by the applicant.
(3) As part of the plan submission process, the applicant shall state
what improvements, if any, that the applicant intends to make to
the land to make it suitable for intended purposes, such as grading
or landscaping. The land shall be stabilized and free of construction
debris at the time of dedication. The site shall not contain above
ground or open stormwater management facilities or be comprised
of land that otherwise would not be developed due to physical,
environmental or other developmental limitations.
D. Developer dedication of usable facilities. The Recreation and Park Plan
recommends, in part, that residential developers dedicate land within a
development in an amount equal to 0.0235 acre (1,024 square feet) per
dwelling unit (single-family residential lot equivalent). In practical
application, the dedication of 1,024 square feet per lot could have
unintended and adverse consequences. Specifically, it is not the intent
of this plan for Lower Paxton Township to encourage or accept the
dedication of small, limited-use, difficult-to-maintain tracts of land for
parks and recreational facilities. To ensure that Lower Paxton Township
encourages and accepts the dedication of usable, contiguous, and
combined tracts of land for parks and recreational facilities, the
following conditions are required for all residential subdivision and land
development plans proposing land dedication.
(1) If the proposed dedication of land that does not abut an existing
municipal park and recreational facility, the amount of land
required shall be in an amount equal to 0.047 acre (2,047 square
feet) per dwelling unit (single-family residential lot equivalent).
(2) The increased acreage requirement (0.0235 acre per dwelling unit
to 0.047 acre per dwelling) provided for in Subsection D(1) above
does not apply to the fee-in-lieu of recreation dedication formula.
(3) A minimum of two acres of land is required for dedication of land
for a freestanding park and recreational facility.
(4) If the proposed dedication of land provides less than two acres of
land, and if said land does not abut an existing municipal park and
recreational facility, then the Township shall require the payment of
a fee-in-lieu of land dedication.
§ 180-522 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-522
1:453
(5) Nothing within this chapter shall prohibit a developer from offering
land for dedication as a park and recreational facility that is larger
in area than that required by these regulations.
E. Design requirements for lands to be dedicated. The following criteria
shall be considered in determining whether to approve the proposed
location of and improvements to recreation areas.
(1) The site shall have a minimum of 150 feet of frontage on a public
street and be easily accessible from all areas of the neighborhood/
subdivision or land development.
(2) The recreation area shall consist of one contiguous tract of land
and of usable proportions in terms of tract width and depth. At least
75% of the tract shall have a slope of 6% or less, with soil
conditions suitable for establishment of proper vegetative cover
(see Township Zoning Ordinance § 203-310, Steep slopes).
(3) The site shall not contain utility easements or rights-of-way that
would adversely affect the site, stormwater management facilities,
BMPs, wetlands, steep slopes (>15%), floodplain areas, or be
comprised of lands that otherwise could not be developed due to
physical, environmental or other limitations.
(4) Whenever possible, the site shall be adjacent to other existing
recreational lands to create a comprehensive recreation area.
(5) The size and shape of the site should be suitable for development as
a particular type of recreation area as categorized by the Township
in its Recreation Plan.
(6) Lands to be dedicated should be at least two acres in area.
(7) The site shall be located and designed to conveniently access public
utilities which may be extended by the applicant including sanitary
sewer, water and electric service to be utilized by the property. If
the land to be dedicated is proposed to have recreational facilities
constructed by the applicant, sufficient parking shall be
constructed by the applicant to support these facilities.
(8) If the site has been disturbed or altered prior to dedication, the
applicant shall improve it as near as possible to a condition
acceptable to the Township including, but not limited to, grading,
topsoiling and seeding, and construction of buffering acceptable to
the Township. Slopes of a 3:1 ratio or higher shall be seeded with
ground cover vegetation.
(9) If the subdivision site has been identified on the Township
Greenway Plan, or is otherwise appropriate for construction of a
greenway, the value of the greenway shall be considered as an
alternative to traditional park land and/or fee-in-lieu payments. In
most circumstances, the greenway shall be placed within an
§ 180-522 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-522
1:454
easement or a publicly dedicated right-of-way. Greenway
development shall be in accordance with the Township Greenway
Plan.
(10) The proposed final condition of the tract to be dedicated shall be
fully depicted on the subdivision or land development plan.
F. Fee in lieu of land dedication requirements. Where the Board of
Supervisors determines that the land does not meet the requirements of
§ 180-522E, the Board of Supervisors may accept a payment of a fee in
lieu of such land dedication which shall be payable to the Township as a
condition of approval of the final plan by the Board of Supervisors. The
amount of such fee shall be calculated using the following formula
(0.0235 acre/dwelling unit) multiplied by a recent average of lot prices
per acre as determined by Lower Paxton Township. The formula can
also be described as a mathematical equation as follows:
Recreation area
required
0.0235 acres/dwelling
unit
X
Average
Lot Price
=
Fee-in-Lieu
Payment
G. Limitations on uses of fees. A fee authorized under this section shall,
upon its receipt by the Township, be deposited in an interest-bearing
account. Interest earned on such an account shall become funds in that
account. Funds from such accounts shall be expended only to acquire
lands and to design and construct new recreation facilities within the
Township.
H. Private dedication of land. The Board of Supervisors may accept the
private reservation of the required percentage of land in lieu of public
dedication. The land set aside shall be suitable in size, dimensions and
topography in relationship to the proposed use; shall be convenient to
the residents of the development to be served; and shall be accessible
for maintenance of such recreation areas by maintaining ownership or
by providing for and establishing an organization for the ownership and
maintenance of the private recreation area. When a recreation area is
dedicated to a private organization, the area may remain available for
general public use without fees or charges except in specific cases of
prior reservation of facilities. When the general public is allowed free
and unrestricted use of the private recreation area, no fee-in-lieu
payment is necessary. If use of the private recreation area is restricted
to only residents of the development, 50% of fee-in-lieu funds shall be
payable to the Township as a condition of approval of the final plan or
each phase thereof.
I. Optional recreation procedure. Upon agreement by the applicant, the
Township may accept the construction of recreational facilities; the
donation of recreation equipment or facilities; the payment of fees in
lieu of dedication; the use of easements to accommodate greenways;
the private reservation of land for recreation purposes; the dedication

of land located in other areas of the Township, or a combination of the
above in order to satisfy the recreation requirements of a particular
subdivision or land development.
J. Timing for contributions/dedication. The dedication of land shall occur
by transferable deed immediately following the recording of the final
subdivision or land development plan for the phase in which the
dedication is required. Where a payment of a fee in lieu of dedication is
approved, the payment shall be made as a condition of approval of the
final plan and shall be payable, in full, prior to recording of a final plan.
Where recreation land or facility to be dedicated or privately developed
recreation land or facility is to be developed in a later phase, the
Township may require bonding in an amount to be determined by the
Township Engineer to be 110% of the value of the privately owned
recreation land or facility to be set aside in a later phase.

Traffic Impact Studies
§ 180-601. Intent.
The intent of a traffic impact study is to identify and plan for safe means of
ingress and egress for proposed developments; to understand the adequacy
of the existing transportation network for the intended use; to identify
any potential transportation impacts of the proposed subdivision and/or
land development; and to determine any roadway or traffic signalization
improvements necessary to mitigate any impacts resulting from the planned
development.
§ 180-602. General provisions.
§ 180-603. Contents.
The study shall be prepared in accordance with the Institute of
Transportation Engineer's (ITE) Traffic Engineering Handbook an ITE's
Transportation Impact Analyses for Site Development, current editions, and
A. A traffic impact study shall be submitted for subdivision and land
developments which meet the following criteria:
(1) Residential: involving 50 or more dwelling units.
(2) Nonresidential: involving 100 or more new peak hour trips.
(3) Other: whenever the Township shall find that there is reasonable
grounds to believe that the existing transportation network may be
inadequate to handle the volume or character of traffic likely to
result from the proposed subdivision or land development.
B. The study shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a professional
engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with
sufficient prior traffic study and traffic engineering experience to
qualify the engineer to perform the study and render any opinions and
recommendations set forth therein.
C. Study area boundaries shall be determined in accordance with the
publication referenced in § 180-703 below and through discussions with
the Township Engineer. At a minimum, the study area shall include any
intersection that experiences an increase of 50 peak hour directional
trips attributed to the development and other intersections which, in
the opinion of the Township, warrant inclusion in the study. A pre-study
conference between the applicant's Traffic Engineer and the Township
is required prior to undertaking the traffic impact study. Where a
subdivision or land development project requires access to a State
highway and meets the requirements of the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation (PennDOT) for a traffic study, then PennDOT shall
also be consulted regarding the scope of the study prior to proceeding
with the work.

computer output and calculations in appendices.
§ 180-605. Responsibility for improvements.
Where the traffic impact study indicates that on-site improvements are
necessary or advisable to existing Township and/or state streets and
intersections in order (i) to assure adequate, safe and convenient access
to each lot and structure and parking compound proposed as part of the
development of the subject tract, (ii) to accommodate the traffic due to the
proposed development, (iii) to provide for an acceptable level of service
and delay for the design year, or years for phased projects, with the
development which is at least equivalent to the projected level of service
and delay for the design year(s) without the proposed subdivision or
development, and (iv) to preserve the existing convenience of access to
or ability to exit from abutting lots which gain access from the existing
street, the applicant shall install all such indicated on-site improvements.
The applicant shall install additional traffic lanes, traffic dividers, traffic
control devices, traffic signals, and other measures as appropriate to ensure
that the development of the subject tract does not adversely impact the
existing street system and access to or the ability to exit from lots gaining
access from an affected street. If the traffic impact study indicates that
on-site improvements must be made to a state roadway, the applicant
better for all approaches in the horizon year. All physical on-site
improvements shall be shown on the subdivision and/or land
development plan and approved by the Township Engineer prior to
any plan approval by the Board of Supervisors. Any future phased
improvements shall also be planned and represented by a phasing
schedule outlining the time frame or threshold for implementation
along with the responsible party. For each recommended off-site
improvement, provide a schematic drawing of existing and proposed
conditions as well as a narrative description of the improvement,
including the estimated cost of the improvements. All recommended
improvements shall be clearly feasible from an engineering and
construction perspective. Costs shall be separated for any
recommended off-site improvements and any required on-site
improvements.
§ 180-603 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-605
1:461
shall also take all action necessary to obtain any Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation permits and approvals to install the necessary street
widening or traffic signals or traffic control devices. If the traffic impact
study recommends installation of traffic signals or traffic signal
modifications as part of the on-site improvements, the applicant shall
prepare all plans and studies and submit all necessary applications to
enable the installation of the traffic signal or modifications and shall install
the traffic signal or modifications at their cost and expense. If the traffic
impact study indicates that traffic control devices or regulations, including,
but not limited to, stop intersections, speed limit reductions, or parking
prohibitions, are required as part of the on-site improvements, the applicant
shall prepare all traffic studies necessary to justify imposition of such
regulations in accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regulations and shall pay all costs associated with the preparation and
enactment of an ordinance to establish such regulations:
A. The applicant shall bear all costs and expenses in connection with the
on-site improvements required by this article. If the applicant requires
the Township to submit any permit applications or requests for
approvals in the name of the Township, the applicant shall reimburse
the Township for all costs and expenses incurred by the Township in
connection with its review of the application and submission of the
application to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation or any
other governmental agency.
B. When the Township determines that a portion or all of the required onsite
improvements or that a portion or all of any agreed to off-site
improvements are not feasible or appropriate at the present time, the
applicant shall enter into a applicant's Agreement with the Township
and deposit financial security with the Township until such time that the
improvements are satisfactorily installed by the applicant and accepted
by the Township in accordance with other provisions of this chapter.

Hydrogeologic Analysis and Water Quality Testing
§ 180-701. Testing required.
A hydrogeologic analysis and water quality testing shall be required prior to
the approval of any subdivision or land development plan representing more
than 10 dwelling units, or a nonresidential use or uses which individually or
collectively have an anticipated daily water usage demand of 4,000 gallons
per day or more, which proposes to utilize an on-site community public
water supply system or individual private wells. However, this requirement
will not apply to any single-family residential development where individual
lots are larger than one acre.
§ 180-702. Test standards and procedures.
A. No person shall propose the use of an on-site public water supply
system or individual wells for a development activity described in
§ 180-801 without first administering the aquifer test required by this
article and meeting the minimum requirements of § 180-803.
(1) Test objective. The objectives of an aquifer test shall be one or
more of the following:
(a) To obtain sufficient data for the calculations of aquifer
performance, including the coefficients of transmissibility and
storage, permeability, long-term well yield, and specific
capacity.
(b) To determine the location and character of geologic
boundaries.
(c) To ascertain the effects of well interference between on-site
wells and surrounding off-site wells.
B. Test standard. The aquifer test shall establish that the proposed well(s)
is (are) capable of supplying potable water at the minimum rate of 400
gallons per day per dwelling unit or in the case of nonresidential use,
the anticipated daily water flow, at a demand rate of not less than 10
gallons per minute for one hour, either with or without the use of a
storage system. The test shall also establish that no significant adverse
impact will result to other existing on-site and surrounding wells.
C. Test supervision and evaluation. The aquifer test shall be conducted
under the supervision of a professional geologist or professional
engineer, using testing procedures hereinafter set forth. The geologist
or engineer shall be responsible for notifying the Township a minimum
of three days prior to the test. He or she will also summarize the test
and its significance and make recommendations as to the suitability of
the well or wells for the intended uses. The final report of the
supervising person shall include an opinion as to whether the proposed
use of the well will have an impact upon other existing wells in the
§ 180-701 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-702

Township with a copy of all field notes and test results.
D. Test method. The method for conducting the aquifer test shall be as
follows:
(1) An aquifer test shall be conducted for a minimum of 12 hours at a
constant rate of pumping. The test well, shall be the one proposed
for the specified development activity for which the test is
conducted. Two observation wells which have hydraulic continuity
with the pumped well are required. The preferred method of
analysis of the aquifer test data is the nonequilibrium formula,
although other methods are available and may be used. These
include various methods of analysis of either the drawdown or
recovery data.
E. Collection of data. Data shall be collected in conjunction with the
aquifer test as follows:
(1) Prior to the test:
(a) Collection of geologic data of the area to be tested including
well logs, if available.
(b) History of water level fluctuations in the area when available.
(c) The location, relative elevations and static water levels in the
pumped well and the observation well or wells.
(2) During the test: A standard aquifer test field data sheet will be
required for a pumped well and each observation well. The data
sheet shall include columns for listing:
(a) Date.
(b) Elapsed time since pumping started/stopped to the nearest
tenth of a minute.
(c) Depth to water below land surface to the nearest tenth of a
foot.
(d) Drawdown and recovery in feet and tenths of feet.
(e) Observed discharge at specified intervals in gallons per
minute.
(3) Following the test: A report shall be prepared summarizing all
project information and analyses including findings and
recommendations regarding the adequacy of the groundwater
supply for the proposed development. In accordance with
recognized principles of well hydraulics, graphs shall be included
to show time drawdown and time recovery for the pumped well and
the observation wells. A distance drawdown graph will be required
for anticipated rates of pumping. Computation of the coefficients of

ARTICLE X
Traffic Calming
§ 180-1001. Intent.
The purpose of traffic calming is to encourage the design of streets and
roadside appurtenances to be pedestrian-friendly and aesthetically
pleasing, with the goal to reduce vehicle operating speeds, promote
adherence to the speed limit within a development, and negate the need for
future traffic calming retrofits. Traffic calming shall enhance the livability
of a street and shall produce a roadway network that naturally disperses
and slows traffic. Traffic calming shall be implemented in a comprehensive
approach utilizing both noninvasive and invasive techniques as differing
situations apply. Noninvasive traffic calming, such as traffic calming
through geometric design elements, shall be considered first. Invasive
traffic calming shall be applied where dictated by this chapter.
§ 180-1002. General provisions.
A. A traffic calming plan shall be submitted for review by the Township
Engineer, Public Safety Committee, and Planning Commission. This
plan shall depict specific design elements that have been utilized to
calm traffic.
B. A traffic calming plan shall be required for all proposed developments
that meet the requirement to prepare a traffic study. The traffic calming
plan shall include the following:
(1) All features required on the site plan.
(2) The location and type of speed control points.
(3) All proposed traffic markings, regulatory signs and warning signs.
(4) All noninvasive traffic calming features.
(5) All invasive traffic calming features.
C. The plan shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a professional
engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with
sufficient prior traffic engineering experience to qualify the engineer to
develop the plan and render any opinions and recommendations set
forth therein.
D. Traffic calming shall be required on all minor roads.
E. Traffic calming shall be required on collector roads within 600 feet of
areas of concentrated pedestrian traffic (i.e.: town squares,
intersections of two collector roads in a business district, parks,
schools, churches, planned Greenway Plan and Comprehensive Plan
improvements) and within all developments required to install
sidewalks.
§ 180-1001 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 180-1002
1:487
F. Design speeds. As per Chapter 180, Article V, roads shall be designed to
encourage the adherence to the respective design speeds.
G. All traffic calming elements shall be designed in accordance with
Pennsylvania's Traffic Calming Handbook. All features shall also be
designed to facilitate a forty-two-foot minimum turning radius and
eleven-foot minimum travel lane to facilitate emergency vehicles and
snow clearing apparatus.
H. Noninvasive traffic calming elements are design elements relating to
street geometry and are the preferred method of traffic calming, such
as:
(1) Curvilinear roadway design.
(2) Decreased street width.
(3) "T" intersections.
(4) Alternating parking.
(5) Roundabouts.
(6) Boulevard entrances.
(7) Boulevard roadways.
I. Invasive traffic calming elements involve the physical change of the
street or roadside appurtenances that limit vehicle operating speeds.
Invasive traffic calming elements shall be considered at locations of
concentrated pedestrian movements, as previously defined where noninvasive
design elements cannot be employed. Refer to Subsection
J(3)(a) for preferred examples of invasive traffic calming devices.
J. Speed control points are points at which speed is limited by either
invasive or noninvasive traffic calming elements. The maximum road
length between speed control points shall be 600 feet. Types of speed
control points are:
(1) Warranted stop sign:
(a) Stop signs shall not be used as speed control points unless the
stop sign meets warrants for installation as set forth in the
current edition of PennDOT Publication 212 and the Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices as published by the Federal
Highway Administration.
(2) Horizontal curve:
(a) Curvilinear street form is a preferred method of noninvasive
traffic calming that not only reduces vehicle speed but also
enhances aesthetics. The "600 feet" measurements shall be
measured from the point of curvature (PC) of the curve.
§ 180-1002 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-1002
1:488
(3) Traffic calming device:
(a) A traffic calming device is an invasive physical alteration of the
roadway, or roadside appurtenance that has the tendency to
limit vehicle operating speeds. Refer to PennDOT Publication
383, "Pennsylvania Traffic Calming Handbook," for
background information regarding traffic calming techniques
and devices. Preferred examples are:
[1] Curb extensions.
[2] Intersection bulb-outs.
[3] Gateways.
[4] Textured crosswalks.
[5] Speed humps.
[6] Raised crosswalks.
[7] Raised intersection.

for the protection of the public health, safety, comfort, property or
general welfare, pursuant to the authority of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, as
reenacted and amended, or such statutes hereinafter in effect, and shall
be construed most favorably to the Township as encouraging standards
of planning and development exceeding these basic and minimum
regulations.
A. The Board of Supervisors shall have the duty and authority for the
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. As
directed by the Board, officials of the Township having regulatory
duties shall have the duty and authority for the controlling enforcement
of the provisions of this chapter.
B. Permits required by the Township for the erection or alteration of
buildings, the installation of streets, stormwater drainage systems, or
for other appurtenant improvements to or use of the land, shall not be
issued by any Township official responsible for such issuance until it has
been ascertained that the site for such building, alteration,
improvement, or use is contained in a subdivision or land development
plan approved and publicly recorded in accordance with the provisions
of this and other applicable Township Codes and Ordinances.
A. The provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for
the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the residents
and inhabitants of Lower Paxton Township. The Board of Supervisors
may grant a modification of the requirements of one or more provisions
of this chapter if the Board concludes that literal enforcement will exact
undue hardship because of peculiar or unique conditions pertaining to
the land in question, provided that such modifications will not be
contrary to the public interest and that the purpose and intent of this
chapter is observed.
B. All requests for a modification of requirements shall be in writing to the
Board and shall accompany and be part of the application for
subdivision or land development. The request shall state in full the
grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship upon which the
request is based; the provision or provisions of the Ordinance involved;
and the minimum modification necessary to afford relief. The request
for a modification of requirements shall also be referred to the
Township Planning Commission for advisory comments.

Board of Supervisors. A written record of the action shall be kept for all
modification requests.
D. A listing of all modifications granted by the Board of Supervisors shall
be clearly identified on the preliminary and/or final plan for ease of
future reference.
A. An applicant, subdivider, landowner or developer aggrieved by any
action of the Board of Supervisors regarding refusal to approve a
subdivision or land development plan may, within 30 days of such
refusal, appeal to the Common Pleas Court of Dauphin County. Any
other appeals by aggrieved parties or other landowners shall be subject
to the appeal procedures outlined in Article X of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, as
reenacted and amended.
A. Annually, the Board of Supervisors shall establish, by resolution, a
schedule of fees, charges and expenses pertaining to application filing
fees, plan review fees, engineering and legal fees, inspection fees and
other matters necessary for the administration of this chapter. The
schedule of fees shall be made available in the Township municipal
building during normal business hours.
B. At the time of filing, all plans shall be accompanied by a check payable
to Lower Paxton Township, in the amount specified herein, to cover the
required initial application fees to help defray the cost of reviewing the
proposed plans and required data. Also at the time of filing, all plans
shall be accompanied by a check payable to the Dauphin County
Planning Commission, in the amount specified by the county, to cover
the costs of the County Planning Commission review and report.
C. Any additional fees incurred due to review during the review process
shall be promptly billed by Lower Paxton Township to the applicant, and
the same shall be paid by the applicant within 30 days. Until all fees,

record, nor shall any permits related to the project be issued.
D. Review fees shall include the reasonable and necessary charges by the
Township's Engineer, Solicitor or other professional consultant for
review and report to the Township related to the application as duly
filed. Such review fees shall be reasonable and in accordance with the
ordinary and customary charges by the Township Engineer, Solicitor or
professional consultant for similar service in the community, but in no
event shall the fees exceed the rate or fees charged by the engineer,

otherwise imposed on applicants.
E. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such review fees,
the applicant shall, within 15 days of the billing date, notify the
Township in writing that such fees are disputed, in which case the
Township shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land
development application due to the applicant's request over disputed
fees. In the event that the Township and the applicant cannot agree on
the amount of review fees which are reasonable and necessary, then the
fees shall be recalculated and recertified by another professional
engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually
by the Township and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified
by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall
be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen,
fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the
Township and the applicant or developer.
F. Whenever an application is disapproved by the Township, withdrawn by
the applicant or subject to other similar action, and subsequently
resubmitted by the applicant, the Township shall require the payment
of new fees as any resubmission shall be considered as a new
submission.
A. Preventive remedies.

Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property in
violation of this chapter. This authority to deny such a permit or
approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
(a) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(b) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee
had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(c) The current owner of record who acquired the property
subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to
whether such current owner had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.

acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation
without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual
or constructive knowledge of the violation.

require compliance with the conditions that would have been
applicable to the property at the time the applicant acquired an
interest in such real property.
B. Enforcement remedies.
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated
the provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable thereof
in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, pay

reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Township as a result
thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the
Magisterial District Judge, determining that there has been a
violation, further determines that there was a good faith basis for
the person, corporation violating this chapter to have believed that
there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the
date of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial District
Judge, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.
(2) The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per-diem judgment pending a
final adjudication of the violation and judgment.
(3) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed or interpreted
to grant to any person or entity other than the Township the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this chapter.

proceedings brought under this chapter.
A. From the time an application for approval of a plan, whether
preliminary or final, is duly filed as provided in this chapter, and while

amendment of this chapter, zoning or other governing ordinance or
plan shall affect the decision on such application adversely to the
applicant, and the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in
accordance with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as
they stood at the time the application was duly filed. The applicant shall
be entitled to final approval in accordance with the terms of the
§ 180-1106 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 180-1107
1:494
approved preliminary application as hereinafter provided. However,
if an application is properly and finally denied, any subsequent
application shall be subject to the intervening change in governing
regulations.
B. When an application for approval of a plan, whether preliminary or
final, has been approved without conditions or approved by the
applicant's acceptance of conditions, no subsequent change or
amendment in this chapter, zoning or other governing ordinance or
plan shall be applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to
commence and to complete any aspect of the approved development in
accordance with the terms of such approval within five years from such
approval.
C. Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid
five-year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary
approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary
approval, the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of
this chapter or the governing ordinance or plans as they stood at the
time when the application for such approval was duly filed.
D. Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plan within the aforesaid fiveyear
limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the Board of
Supervisors, no change of any ordinance or plan enacted subsequent to
the date of filing of the preliminary plan shall modify or revoke any
aspect of the approved final plan pertaining to zoning classification or
density, lot, building, street or utility location.
E. In the case of a preliminary plan calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by
the landowner with the preliminary plan delineating all proposed
sections as well as deadlines within which applications for final plan
approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be
updated annually by the applicant on or before the anniversary of the
preliminary plan approval, until final plan approval of the final section
has been granted and any modification in the aforesaid schedule shall
be subject to approval of the Board of Supervisors in its discretion.
F. Each section in any residential subdivision or land development, except
for the last section, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the total number
of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser
percentage is approved by the Board of Supervisors in its discretion.
Provided the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any
of the conditions of the preliminary plan approval, including compliance
with landowner's aforesaid schedule of submission of final plans for the
various sections, then the aforesaid protections afforded by
substantially completing the improvements depicted upon the final plan
within five years shall apply and for any section or sections, beyond the
initial section, in which the required improvements have not been
substantially completed within said five-year period the aforesaid

is hereby charged with the duty of withholding from each of his

employer or other nonprincipal employers located in higher priority
political subdivisions as described in Subsection E of this section or has
an exemption certificate on file with the employer and the collector as
describe in Subsections B or C of § 185-42.
B. Withholding of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for each
payroll period during the fiscal year in which an employee is engaging
in an occupation unless the employee is engaging in concurrent
employment. For purposes of determining the pro-rata share, the
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll
period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. If employment of an
employee subject to withholding is subsequently terminated, the
terminated employee shall be liable for the outstanding balance of the
tax due.
C. If a person who claimed an exemption for a fiscal year and filed an
exemption certificate pursuant to Subsection B of § 185-42 becomes
subject to the tax for that year, the employer shall withhold the tax for
the first payroll period after receipt of notification that the employee is
subject to the tax in a lump sum equal to the amount of the tax which

making payment by employers.
§ 185-39. Priority of claims to collect the tax when an individual is

the employee's higher priority occupation is taxed. In order for the
employer to refrain from withholding, it shall also be necessary for the
employee to affirm in writing to the employer that the pay statement
provided is from the higher priority employer or that the proof of
payment of the tax was on account of a higher priority occupation, and
that the employee will notify other employers of a change in higher
priority employer or occupation within two weeks of the occurrence.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for
payment of the withheld tax money to the collector if the failure to
withhold the tax arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. No employer shall be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates or monitoring eligibility or exempting an
employee from withholding except where a person with an exemption
certificate issued under Subsection B of § 185-42 becomes subject to
the tax as described in Subsection C of this section.
A. Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of
the tax on forms to be supplied to him by the collector. It is further
provided that if the employer fails to file such return and pay the tax
within the time required, whether or not he makes collection thereof
from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to such employee,
the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as
though the tax had originally been levied against him.
B. Each employer shall use his employment records from January 1 to
March 31 for determining the number of employees from whom the tax
shall be deducted and paid over to the Treasurer on or before April 30.
Supplemental reports shall be made by each employer on July 30,
October 30 and January 30 of new employees and additional tax
withholdings and any new exemptions on continued employees as
reflected on his employment records from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to
September 30, and October 1 to December 31. Payments on these
supplemental reports shall be made on July 30, October 30 and January
30, respectively.
C. If an employer has employees for whom he is not withholding the tax
pursuant to Subsection A of § 185-37, the employer shall include such
employee on his return by setting forth his name, address, social
security number, and the name and account number of the employer(s)
who withheld the tax(es) and/or the name of the taxing jurisdiction(s) to
whom an employee paid a tax on a self-employed occupation.
§ 185-37 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 185-39
1:524
A. Each individual who shall have more than one occupation within the
Township shall be subject to the payment of the tax on his principal
occupation by the individual if he is self-employed or to withholding of
the tax by his principal employer if he is employed. If one of his
occupations is a self-employed one, he shall pay the tax in its entirety to
the collector and receive a receipt of payment as described in
Subsection E of § 185-40. When the receipt of payment is presented to
an employer that employer will not withhold the tax or part of the tax by
authority of Subsections A and E of § 185-37. If an individual is
employed in all of his occupations within the Township, his principal
employer shall withhold the tax and deliver to him evidence of
withholding on a form meeting the requirements of Subsection E of
§ 185-37 to be furnished to the employer by the collector, which form
shall be evidence of withholding having been made. When the
completed form is presented to a nonprincipal employer, that employer
will not withhold the tax or part of the tax by authority of Subsections A
and E of § 185-37.
B. In the event a person is engaged in occupations which require his
working in more than one political subdivision, the first priority political
subdivision to collect the tax shall be the political subdivision in which
his principal employer is located or, if self-employed, the political
subdivision in which his principal occupation is located. If the political
subdivision where the principal employer or principal occupation is
located does not collect the tax, the second priority political subdivision
to collect the tax shall be the political subdivision in which the person
resides and works to the extent a tax is not levied by the first priority
political subdivision. The third priority political subdivision to collect
the tax shall be the political subdivision in which a person is working
and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home to the
extent a tax is not levied by the first and second priority political
subdivisions. The place where a person works and the priority of
collection shall be determined as of the day the taxpayer first becomes
subject to the tax during the fiscal year.
C. It is the intent of this provision that no person shall pay more than $52
in any fiscal year as a tax, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which such person may be employed within any
given fiscal year. In case of dispute, the sum of tax receipts which are
not duplications from taxing jurisdictions, any other appropriate
evidence of payment, and/or the most recent pay statements from an
employer indicating accumulated and prospective withholding of tax
actually due to higher priority taxing political subdivisions for that
fiscal year, equaling at least $52 shall constitute prima-facie
certification of payment to all other political subdivisions. Any tax paid,
withheld, or prospectively to be withheld, that is not to a higher priority
taxing jurisdiction should not be included in determining this $52
amount. An employee should apply for refund for such amounts paid to
taxing jurisdictions of lesser priority.

§ 196-24. Campers, trailers and boats. [Added 12-5-1988 by Ord.
No. 88-19]
No person shall park, store or let stand a camper, trailer, boat or any other
similar vehicle which is not self-propelled on any public street at any time.

premises. Such designation may be appealed within 10 days by filing a
written objection to such designation with the Public Safety Director, or
his designee. The appeal shall be heard by the members of the Board
of Supervisors, a majority of which may affirm, disaffirm or modify the

A. The parking of truck tractors, truck tractors with trailers and trailers is
prohibited on any and all public streets in any residential district
according to the zoning classifications and regulations set forth in
Chapter 203, Zoning. [Amended 8-17-1999 by Ord. No. 99-08]
B. Truck tractors with trailers may be temporarily parked on any public
street within a residential district for the purpose of and while actually
engaged in loading or unloading property in front of or making local
deliveries to premises situate on said street, provided that at least three
portable emergency warning devices are displayed upon the roadway at
the approach to the vehicle.
C. Notice of parking restrictions shall be provided by means of posted
traffic control devices, certified letter, personal service or placing a

In absence of a posted traffic control device, this section shall not be
enforced by citation unless a notice of violation has been issued to the
owner or operator of the vehicle by any means previously enumerated,
prior to the date and time enforcement is initiated.
A. Certain public streets in residential areas may be subject to vehicle
parking from nonresidential uses, therefore depriving the residents
whose properties abut said streets of on-street parking spaces in which
to park their vehicles. Those streets in residential areas affected by
parking from nonresidential uses may also be subjected to a high
degree of vehicle traffic, illegal parking, winter maintenance problems,
litter and loitering which negatively impacts public safety and welfare
within the residential area. The establishment of a resident permit
parking program for residential areas adversely affected by vehicle
parking from nonresidential uses may facilitate efficient movement of
traffic by providing a resident on-street parking preference during
certain hours of the day and days of the week.
§ 196-23 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 196-25.1
1:554
B. In determining that a specific residential area is eligible for the resident
permit parking program, the following factors shall be taken into
consideration in a study to be undertaken by the Township's Police
Department:
(1) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in Lower
Paxton Township.
(2) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking,
winter maintenance, litter, loitering and related safety and welfare
concerns.
(3) The availability and proximity of public transportation to the
nonresidential uses that generate on-street parking within the
residential area.
(4) The desire and need of residents of a residential area for the
resident permit parking program.
(5) The availability of off-street parking to serve the needs of the
nonresidential uses generating on-street parking within a
residential area.
(6) The zoning designation of the residential area as referenced in the
Lower Paxton Township Zoning Ordinance.42
(7) The ability of individuals going to or from nonresidential uses to
safely access vehicles, as pedestrians, parked in residential areas.
C. The public streets in a residential area designated for the resident
permit parking are those deemed "impacted" and hence eligible for the
residential permit parking program, on the basis of the following
warrants, as documented by a study undertaken by the Township's
Police Department:
(1) During any period of a calendar week, between the hours of 7:00
a.m. and 11:00 p.m., the number of vehicles parked (or standing),
legally or illegally, on public streets in a residential area shall be
equal to 50% or more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the
area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal parking space shall
be 20 linear feet.
(2) During the same period as specified in Subsection C(l) above, 10%
or more of the vehicles parking (or standing) on the streets in the
residential area are not registered in the name of a person residing
in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest available
information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regarding registration
of motor vehicles shall be used.
42.Editor's Note: See Ch. 203, Zoning.
§ 196-25.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 196-25.1
1:555
(3) The warrants stated in Subsection C(l) and (2) above shall be met
on no less than one occasion per calendar week, for not less than
two successive weeks. Moreover, a reasonable expectation shall
exist that on-street parking in a residential area from
nonresidential uses will continue without the institution of the
resident permit parking program.
D. The public streets in a residential area designated for the resident
permit parking may also be those deemed "potentially impacted" and
hence eligible for the residential permit parking program, on the basis
of the following warrants, as documented by a study undertaken by the
Township's Police Department:
(1) Residential areas in which parking from nonresidential uses may be
reasonably expected to occur should the resident permit parking
program be instituted in an impacted area.
(2) Residential areas, in which parking from nonresidential uses
occurs due to the migration of vehicular parking upon institution of
the resident permit parking program in a neighboring residential
area.
(3) In the determination of a potentially impacted area, the warrants
stated in Subsection C above, regarding impacted areas, are not
applicable.
E. Application for a resident parking permit shall be made to the Police
Department by the person desiring the permit, who shall be only the
owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or immediately
adjacent to a street or other location designated for the resident permit
parking program. A separate application shall be required for each
motor vehicle. Each application shall contain the following information:
(1) The name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be, of the
motor vehicle.
(2) The address of the owner or driver, as the case may be.
(3) The make, model and registration number of the motor vehicle and
the driver number as taken from the applicant's current driver's
license. The applicant shall be required, at the time of making
application, to present his driver's license and the vehicle
registration card.
F. Upon receipt of the application and verification that the information
within which indicates that the applicant is entitled to participate in the
resident permit parking program, the Lower Paxton Township Police
Department shall issue a parking permit. Said permit shall be
permanently valid, as long as the recipient remains a qualified applicant
in possession of the motor vehicle referenced within said application. It
shall be unlawful and a violation of this article for any person to display
other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking on a
§ 196-25.1 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 196-25.1
1:556
public street posted for resident permit parking at any time when
permits are to be displayed.
G. Temporary parking permits may be issued by the Lower Paxton
Township Police Department to bona fide visitors of residents located
within an area designated for the resident permit parking program. The
Police Department may also issue two temporary resident parking
permits to the owner(s) of each single-family dwelling unit located
within an area designated for the resident permit parking program.
H. Motor vehicles possessing appropriate handicapped designation, as
issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Transportation, indicating the handicapped status of the owner of the
vehicle shall be exempt from the provisions of this article.
I. The following provisions govern the use of resident parking permits:
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
holder of a resident parking permit shall be permitted to stand or
park a motor vehicle operated by him on public streets posted for
resident permit parking during those times when permit parking of
motor vehicles is permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a
resident parking permit has been issued is so parked, the permit
shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible on the vehicle, as
directed by the Lower Paxton Township Police Department. A
resident parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the
holder a parking space within a designated resident permit parking
area.
(2) A resident parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand or
park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set
aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit
exempt its holder from the observance of any traffic or parking
regulation other than resident permit parking restrictions.
(3) No person other than the permit holder shall use a resident parking
permit or display it on a vehicle. Any such use or display by a
person other than the permit holder shall constitute a violation of
this article by the permit holder and by the person who so used or
displayed the parking permit.
(4) It shall constitute a violation of this article for any person to falsely
represent himself as eligible for a resident parking permit or to
furnish false information on an application to the Lower Paxton
Township Police Department in order to obtain a resident parking
permit.
J. The Lower Paxton Township Police Department shall have authority to
revoke a resident parking permit of any permit holder found to be in
violation of any provision of this ordinance. Upon written notification to
him of the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the parking

continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless a District
Justice, determining that there has been a violation, further

violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the District Justice, and thereafter
each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees
collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid over to the

authorized under this chapter.

exception or variance by the Zoning Hearing Board or upon the
grant of a conditional use, then, in addition to any other remedies
provided by law, the Board of Supervisors may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or
abate such building, structure, landscaping, use or activity or to
prevent, in and about such premises, any act, conduct, business or
use constituting a violation.

(including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot
size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property)
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
ii) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed
in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance and a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property;
iii) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
iv) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
v) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the
least modification possible of the regulation in issue.)

reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
(4) Special exception.
(a) The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special
exceptions filed with the Township staff in writing. The Board

a special exception allowing modifications to specific requirements
of this chapter that the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the

Amendments and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act, as

application and render its decision in accordance with the requirements
of the State Municipalities Planning Code.

use.
D. Conditions. In approving conditional use applications, the Board of
Supervisors may attach conditions they consider necessary to protect
the public welfare and meet the standards of this chapter. These
conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer and failure to
comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation of this chapter
and be subject to the penalties described in this chapter.

or land development approval, erosion control review, wetland
delineation review, stormwater runoff review, review of activity on
steep slopes, or any other review, approval or permit under this chapter

agency of the Township shall not constitute a representation, guarantee
or warranty of any kind by the Township, or its employees, officials,

in the CO or AR Districts and five feet in other districts, except in
the following cases:
(a) The minimum rear setback shall be reduced to thee feet for a
residential accessory storage shed having a total floor area of
less than 150 square feet.
(b) A side yard setback is not required for a structure that is
accessory to a dwelling from a lot line along which two
dwellings are attached (such as a lot line shared by twin
dwellings). However, such structure shall still meet the
minimum side yard on a lot line where the dwellings are not
attached.
(c) A residential porch or deck that is unenclosed may extend a
maximum of 15 feet into the required rear setback. Such porch
or deck may be covered by a roof or awning. Space under an
unenclosed porch may be used for household storage. See
Note D above considering front yard setbacks.

(e) If any accessory building or pool is constructed adjacent to a
street (such as a rear yard on a lot that is adjacent to a street
along the front lot line and another street along the rear lot
line), then the building or pool shall be separated from such
street by a buffer yard meeting § 203-803.
(3) No accessory building and no swimming pool shall be allowed in
the minimum front yard.
A. Lot area. Wetlands (as officially defined under federal and/or state
regulations) shall not count towards more than 50% of the required

§ 203-309. Sewage and water services.
subdivision or land development submitted for approval after the
adoption of this chapter.
B. Wetland studies. It shall be the responsibility of each applicant to
determine whether land areas proposed for alteration meet the federal
or state definition of a wetland prior to submittal of development plans
to the Township. If the Zoning Officer has reason to believe that
wetlands may be present on a site proposed for development or
subdivision, the Zoning Officer may require that the applicant provide a
suitable wetland delineation study prepared by a qualified professional.
The Township may require that the qualifications and any certifications
of the person conducting the wetland delineation be provided in writing
to the Township. The Township may require that a statement be
provided on the plan that is signed by the wetlands delineator stating
that the wetlands are accurately shown according to a standard
government wetlands manual or that wetlands are not present.
[Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
C. Wetland setbacks. A minimum setback of 20 feet shall be required
between any new principal building for which a building permit is
issued after the effective date of this chapter and any "wetland."
A. Central water service. A use shall not be considered to be served by
"Township-approved central water service" unless:
(1) All applicable requirements of state regulations and the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance are met;
(2) The applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Township that there
will be an appropriate system in place to guarantee and properly
fund the long-term operation and maintenance of the system by a
qualified professional operator; and
(3) The applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Township, based
upon review of the Township Engineer, that the system will include
adequate supply, transmission capacity and pressure to serve the
development.
B. Central sewage service. A use shall not be considered to be served by
"Township-approved central sewage service" unless:
(1) All applicable requirements of state regulations and the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance are met;
(2) The applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Township that there
will be an appropriate system in place to guarantee and properly
fund the long-term operation and maintenance of the system by a
qualified professional operator; and
§ 203-308 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-309
1:629
(3) The applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Township, based
upon review of the Township Engineer, that the system will include
adequate treatment capacity and conveyance capacity to serve the
development.
C. Connection to a larger system. Any nonpublic central water or central
sewage system developed after the adoption of this chapter shall be
engineered and constructed in such a manner as to allow its efficient
interconnection in the future into a larger regional system.
(1) Such a system shall include appropriate utility easements and/or
rights-of-way within property controlled by the developer
extending to the borders of the development to allow future
interconnections at logical points.
(2) At the time of subdivision or land development approval, the Board
of Supervisors may request that agreements be established so that
a central water or sewage system is dedicated to a Township
Authority after completion of the development, or at such other
time as is mutually agreed upon. A developer who dedicates a
central water or sewage system to a Township Authority shall
retain the right to use or sell the capacity of the system that was
funded by the developer. The Township may require a developer to
post a bond to guarantee proper operation of a system for at least
two years after dedication.
D. On-lot septic systems.
(1) Purpose: to ensure that a suitable location is available for a new
septic system if the original septic system should malfunction.
(2) This § 203-309D shall only apply to a lot that is officially submitted
for subdivision or land development approval after the adoption of
this chapter.
(3) Each lot shall include both a primary and an reserve septic system
location. Both locations shall be determined by the Township
Sewage Enforcement Officer to meet Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection regulations for a septic system location
prior to approval of the final subdivision or land development plan.
(4) The requirement for a reserve septic system location shall not
apply to the following:
(a) A lot of over 10 acres;
(b) The simple merger of two or more existing lots, or an
adjustment to lot lines of an existing lot;
(c) A vacant lot that includes a permanent deed restriction or
conservation easement prohibiting any construction of
buildings on the lot; or
§ 203-309 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-309
1:630
§ 203-310. Steep slopes. [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
(d) Lots within a subdivision or land development that will abut a
complete capped sewage system constructed by the developer,
the design of which has been approved by the Township.
(5) The reserve septic system location shall be kept clear of buildings
and parking, and shall be shown on any subsequent applications for
new or expanded buildings or parking. The Township may require
that the location be recorded on the deed.
E. Well and septic system locations. Every plan for a subdivision or land
development and every application for a building permit for a new
principal building that will be served by a well and/or septic system
shall designate the proposed well and primary and alternate septic
system locations.
(1) Such plan shall show that the proposed locations will meet the
minimum isolation distances established by PA DEP regulations
between a well and septic systems on the subject lot and all
adjacent lots.
(2) A plan may show the outer extent of potential well locations,
instead of one exact location, provided all of the potential area
would still meet the isolation distance.
(3) If the well or septic system location is proposed to be changed from
the location shown on the submitted plan, then a site plan showing
the revised location shall be submitted for approval by the Zoning
Officer and Sewage Enforcement Officer prior to issuance of the
building permit.
(4) It is requested that well sites be placed in the front yard, thereby
allowing septic systems to be placed in the rear yard. The intent is
to minimize the visibility of any septic mound systems. In addition,
if wells are located in consistent locations within a subdivision, it
will make it easier for adjacent property-owners to meet minimum
separation distances between septic systems and wells.
F. Expansion of septic use. If the Zoning Officer has reason to believe that
a proposed increase in the number of dwelling units or expansion or
change of a nonresidential use would result in increased flow to a septic
system, then the application shall be referred to the Sewage
Enforcement Officer. The Sewage Enforcement Officer shall require
modification, expansion or replacement of the septic system if
necessary to handle the proposed flow.
A. Purposes. The following provisions are primarily intended to avoid
erosion, sedimentation, stormwater management and winter driving
hazards, particularly considering the Township's climate, in addition to
serving the overall purposes of this chapter.
§ 203-309 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-310
1:631
§ 203-311. Open Space Development Overlay District.
B. Regrading. Non-man-made slopes of 15% or more shall not be disturbed
(regraded) prior to the submission of a zoning site plan, or subdivision
or land development plan. This section shall not regulate slopes that
were clearly man-made prior to the adoption of this chapter.
C. Slopes over 25%. A new principal building shall not be located on a
slope greater than 25%.
D. Single-family dwellings and steep slopes. New-single-family detached
dwellings are permitted on slopes that are no greater than 25%.
E. Steep slopes and other uses. A lot shall only be used for a building for
principal uses other than single-family detached dwellings if the
proposed "building area" includes an average slope of less than 20%.
(1) For such uses, the "building area" shall include locations of all
proposed principal buildings and parking areas that serve such
buildings and an area 20 feet around such buildings and related
parking areas.
(2) Access. Each principal building and each parking area shall have
vehicle access from an existing or proposed street by means of a
driveway with a maximum grade of 10%.
F. Site plan and tree protection. If an applicant proposes to alter or build
upon slopes of 15% or greater, then a site plan shall be submitted to the
Zoning Officer. A separate site plan is not required if the same
information was included in an approved subdivision or land
development plan.
(1) Site plan. The site plan shall show:
(a) The proposed lot lines;
(b) The existing and proposed contours; and
(c) Existing and proposed building locations, and the outer
perimeter of the proposed "building area" as described above.
(2) Mature trees. Where building or alteration is proposed on slopes of
over 15%, the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Officer that the removal of healthy trees with a trunk width of over
six inches (measured at a height 4.5 feet above the ground level)
will be minimized. The Zoning Officer may ask for reviews by the
Township Engineer or Planning Commission. The site plan shall
show wooded areas to be removed or preserved, and methods to be
used to make sure trees are protected by temporary fences or other
measures during the construction process.
A. Purposes. To allow reasonable amounts of flexibility in site planning of
residential development to: a) protect environmentally sensitive areas
§ 203-310 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-311
1:632
and avoid severe soil erosion and sedimentation, b) avoid severely
increased stormwater flows and speeds, c) preserve areas of prime
farmland, d) provide additional recreation land, e) steer development to
those areas that are more physically suited for it, f) avoid construction
of steep roads that are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to
maintain and plow snow upon, g) avoid increased use of steep roads
and driveways that are dangerous to drive upon in snow and ice, h)
conserve forested areas that are an important part of the ecological
cycle, providing for groundwater recharge, air pollution reduction and
wildlife habitats, i) reduce construction costs and municipal
maintenance costs, j) provide for transitional forms of development
between residential and agricultural or industrial areas or highways,
with open space serving as a buffer, and k) allow each property owner
a reasonable use of their land, related directly to the features and
location and accessibility of the land. This option will encourage the
preservation of significant areas of preserved open space.
B. Applicability. For land within the OSD Overlay District, this § 203-311
allows an applicant the option to use the provisions of § 203-311 in
place of the provisions of the underlying zoning district. In order to use
§ 203-311, the applicant must prove compliance with all of the
requirements of this § 203-311, to the satisfaction of the Township. If an
area of land is not within the OSD Overlay District, then an applicant
may request that the Board of Supervisors consider a zoning map
amendment to add the OSD Overlay District to that land area. An open
space development shall be permitted by right within the OSD Overlay
District.
(1) An "open space development" is a residential development that
meets the requirements of this § 203-311 and is approved by the
Township as an open space development. An open space
development shall only be allowed in the OSD Overlay District.
(2) Uses. An open space development shall only include the following
uses: single-family detached dwellings, nature preserves,
Township-owned recreation, noncommercial recreation uses that
the Township approves to be within the preserved open space,
utilities necessary to serve the development, and customary
permitted accessory uses. A mobile/manufactured home park shall
not qualify as a open space development.
(3) A tract shall be eligible for approval for a open space development
if it includes a minimum of 10 acres of lot area in common
ownership in the OSD Overlay District. Such land area shall be
contiguous, except that portions of the tract may be separated only
by existing or proposed streets or creeks.
(a) The amount of preserved open space shall be based upon the
total lot area of all lots within the development, prior to
subdivision, and prior to deletion of rights-of-way of future
streets and before deleting the area of any environmental
§ 203-311 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-311
1:633
features. Land area of future rights-of-way of existing streets
may be deleted from the total lot area before calculating the
required amount of preserved open space.
[1] Areas that were preserved by a conservation or
agricultural preservation easement or deed restriction
prior to the submittal of the subdivision plan shall not be
counted towards the area of the tract in calculating
preserved open space or allowed density.
(b) Areas used for a principal nonresidential use (other than uses
approved by the Township to be part of the preserved open
space) shall not be included within the land area used to
calculate residential density.
(c) Conservation easements or deed restrictions shall be
established on lots as necessary to ensure that the maximum
density requirement is met over time. Such conservation
easements shall prevent the re-subdivision of lots in a manner
that would violate this § 203-311.
(4) An open space development shall be designed as a unified,
coordinated residential development, and shall be approved with a
single development plan proposed by a single development entity.
After final subdivision approval and within an approved
development agreement(s) and phasing plan, portions of the
development may be transferred to different entities, provided that
there is compliance with the approved development plan and this
§ 203-311.
(5) Procedures.
(a) Applicants are strongly encouraged to first submit a sketch
plan, before completing detailed fully engineered preliminary
subdivision plans. This two-step process will allow the
Township and the applicant to discuss the preserved open
space and development layout before large sums of money are
spent by the applicant on detailed engineering.
(b) The applicant and Township officials are strongly encouraged
to walk the tract after a detailed existing features map has
been provided to the Township, but before the site layout has
been finalized.
C. Density, open space and lot standards. The maximum number of
dwelling units on the tract shall be determined based upon an existing
features map and a yield plan, except within the AR District.
(1) An existing features map shall be required to be submitted as part
of the application for an open space development. This existing
features map shall accurately show the locations of the following at
a minimum: wetlands, 100-year floodplains, areas of woodland,
§ 203-311 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-311
1:634
existing topography, existing buildings with a description of any
buildings over 70 years old, highlighting of 15 to 25% slopes and
25% and greater slopes, and any major scenic views from within
the tract or from outside of the tract.
(2) A yield plan shall be submitted to the Township by the applicant.
The yield plan shall accurately show the maximum number of
dwelling units that would be possible under current Township
ordinances if the open space development provisions would not be
used, and instead the provisions for conventional development in
the applicable zoning district would be used. The yield plan shall be
completed to an accurate scale, including accurately showing the
Existing Feature Map information described above. The yield plan
shall show potential lots, streets, and retention/detention pond
locations. However, the yield plan shall not serve as, and is not
required to contain, the engineering detail requirements of a
preliminary subdivision plan.
(3) The yield plan shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer and
Township Engineer, and then determined by the Planning
Commission as to whether it represents a reasonably accurate
estimate of the number of dwelling units possible on the site, both
physically and legally. If such estimates are determined to not be
accurate, the applicant shall be required by the Zoning Officer to
revise the yield plan until it is accurate.
(a) For land that is not within the AR District, the maximum
number of dwelling units allowed on the tract through open
space development shall be 10% greater than the number of
dwelling units that is determined by the Township to be
possible under the Township-accepted yield plan.
(b) The allowed number of dwelling units may be rounded to the
nearest whole number.
(c) The yield plan shall not have any legal standing except for the
purposes of determining density for an open space
development.
(4) For land within the AR District, the maximum number of dwelling
units allowed on the tract through open space development shall be
equal to an average of one dwelling unit for every 1.0 acre of total
lot area.
(5) All provisions of the zoning district shall apply, except for
provisions that are specifically modified by this § 203-311. The
following dimensional requirements shall apply, provided that the
total maximum density for the tract is not exceeded:
(a) CO District: The minimum lot area shall be one acre (43,560
square feet). The same dimensional requirements shall apply
as are provided for in conventional development in the AR
§ 203-311 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-311
1:635
District. A minimum of 60% of the total lot area of the tract
(prior to subdivision) shall be preserved as preserved open
space.
(b) AR District: The minimum lot area shall be 20,000 square feet.
The same dimensional requirements shall apply as are
provided for in conventional development in the R-1 district. A
minimum of 40% of the total lot area of the tract (prior to
subdivision) shall be preserved as preserved open space.
(c) R-1 District: The minimum lot area shall be 10,000 square feet.
The same dimensional requirements shall apply as are
provided for in conventional development in the R-2 district. A
minimum of 40% of the total lot area of the tract (prior to
subdivision) shall be preserved as preserved open space.
(d) R-2 District: The minimum lot area for single-family detached
residential lots shall be reduced to 5,000 square feet. All other
dimensional requirements shall remain the same as are listed
for the R-3 District. A minimum of 25% of the total lot area of
the tract (prior to subdivision) shall be preserved as preserved
open space.
(6) Utilities. Any lot of less than one acre shall be served by Townshipapproved
public sanitary sewerage service and public water
service.
(7) Subdivision of part of a tract. This Subsection C(7) addresses a
situation in which only part of a lot is proposed to be subdivided,
and the applicant at the present time does not intend to subdivide
for the maximum number of dwellings allowed by this section. In
such case, the applicant shall establish a permanent conservation
easement covering preserved open space to comply with this
section. Because only part of the tract is being subdivided, it may
not be necessary to meet the preserved open space requirement
based upon the area of the entire tract.
(a) The land under the conservation easement shall be a regular
rectangle in shape and shall be located where it could adjoin
land that would be added as preserved open space in the future
if the total allowed number of dwellings would be developed.
(b) The following hypothetical example assumes a tract includes
50 acres, and the yield plan determines that the applicant for
an open space development is allowed a total of 30 new
dwellings. In this example, the applicant only wishes to
subdivide lots for 10 new dwellings at the present time, which
is 1/3 of the total number of allowed dwellings. At the present
time, only 1/3 of the open space would need to be preserved,
compared to if all of the allowed housing units would be
developed. However, the preserved open space would need to
be placed on the tract at a location where it could be joined by
§ 203-311 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-311
1:636
the remaining acres of land under a conservation easement if
the applicant in the future decided to subdivide lots for the
remaining 20 dwelling units that are allowed.
(8) A minimum of 50% of the required preserved open space shall be in
one contiguous lot, except that the preserved open space may be
separated by creeks, lakes, and a maximum of one street.
(a) The Board of Supervisors may approve the following, if the
applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors
that such configuration would serve the purposes of this
section and be in the best interests of the Township,
considering the unique circumstances of the tract:
[1] A reduction of the percentage of the preserved open space
that is in one lot; or
[2] The crossing of the preserved open space by two or more
streets.
(b) An accessway limited to emergency vehicles may also cross the
preserved open space.
(9) The Board of Supervisors may require that the majority of the
required preserved open space be placed:
(a) Adjacent to an existing or planned public or homeowner
association-owned recreation area;
(b) Adjacent to existing farmland;
(c) At the edge of a neighboring undeveloped lot, where the
preserved open space could be connected in the future to open
space on that neighboring lot; or
(d) Adjacent to an arterial street or expressway where the open
space will serve to buffer homes from the traffic.
D. Conditions for approval. An open space development shall only be
approved if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of
Supervisors, based upon review by the Planning Commission, that the
following additional conditions shall be met:
(1) That the open space development would clearly serve a valid public
purpose that would result in a development that would be superior
to what would result if the land would be developed as a
conventional development. Such valid public purposes include, but
are not limited to, the following:
(a) The permanent preservation of dense forests, steep slopes,
wetlands, creek valleys, highly scenic areas or other sensitive
natural features.
§ 203-311 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-311
1:637
(b) The permanent preservation of a substantial area of land in
agricultural uses, in a tract of proper size and configuration
that allows for efficient agricultural use and that properly
considers the issue of compatibility between the agricultural
uses and homes. In such case, new dwellings shall be clustered
adjacent to existing dwellings and residential zoning districts.
(c) The dedication of recreation land at a site deemed appropriate
by the Board of Supervisors and that involves land that is
clearly suitable for active and/or passive recreation.
(d) The provision of preserved open space in a location that will
allow homes to be buffered from highly-noxious, nuisancegenerating
uses, such as a heavily traveled street or industrial
uses. In such case, intensive landscaping and/or planting for
eventual reforestation shall be provided.
(2) The applicant shall prove that the proposed open space
development has been designed in full consideration of important
natural features, including mature woodlands, creek valleys, steep
slopes and wetlands.
(a) At a minimum, the applicant shall prove that areas along
perennial creeks shall be preserved in their natural state,
except for landscaping, erosion control improvements, public
recreation improvements and needed utility, street and
driveway crossings. Low-maintenance landscaping is
encouraged along creeks and other areas where maintenance
would otherwise be difficult.
(b) The natural features of the site shall be a major factor in
determining the siting of dwelling units and streets.
(3) The Township may require the use of conservation easements
within an open space development to limit the disturbance of
natural slopes over 15%, wetlands, mature forests, creek valleys
and other important natural features.
E. Preserved open space.
(1) Preserved open space. The minimum amount of "preserved open
space" shall be provided, which shall meet the requirements of this
chapter and the definition in § 203-202 of "open space, preserved."
(a) The preserved open space requirements of this § 203-311 shall
be in addition to the recreation land or fee-in-lieu of land
requirements of the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance (SALDO), unless the applicant proves
to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that the
proposed preserved open space would include suitably
improved land that will meet the intent of the recreation land
requirements of the SALDO.
§ 203-311 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-311
1:638
(b) The preserved open space requirements of this § 203-311 shall
not be waived through a payment of a fee in lieu of land.
(2) Open space standards. Required preserved open spaces shall meet
all of the following requirements:
(a) Preserved open space shall be permanently deed-restricted or
protected by an appropriate conservation easement to prevent
the construction of buildings or the use for any nonagricultural
commercial purposes or the use of the land for timber
harvesting, except for routine thinning of woods. Land
approved as required preserved open space shall only be used
for noncommercial active or passive recreation, a
noncommercial community center for meetings and recreation,
a nature preserve, a horse farm, a wholesale plant nursery,
and/or a Township-approved agricultural use.
(b) Improvements to open spaces. Where preserved open space is
proposed to be used for recreation and/or dedicated to the
Township, the application shall include a detailed and legally
binding (if approved) description of what improvements the
applicant will make to any land to make it suitable for its
intended purpose.
[1] Examples of such improvements include preservation and
planting of trees, development of trails, stabilization of
creek banks, removal of undesirable vegetation, and
grading of land for recreation (such as an informal open
play field for youth).
[2] Type of maintenance. The final subdivision plan shall state
the intended type of maintenance of the open space, such
as lawn areas that are regularly mowed, or natural areas
for passive recreation that are intended for minimal
maintenance.
(c) All proposed preserved open space shall be cleared of
construction debris, materials from illegal dumping and any
rocks that were not naturally on the land, unless those rocks
are incorporated into landscaping improvements.
(d) The applicant shall prove that all required preserved open
space would be suitable for its intended and Townshipapproved
purposes. The Township may require the provision of
a trail easement and/or the construction of a recreation trail
through preserved open space. If a developer installs a trail, it
shall be completed prior to the final sale of any adjacent
residential lots.
(e) Lots and preserved open spaces shall be located to promote
pedestrian and visual access to preserved open spaces
whenever possible.
§ 203-311 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-311
1:639
(f) Sufficient access points from each preserved open space shall
be provided to streets for pedestrian access and maintenance
access. The Board of Supervisors may require that
maintenance and/or pedestrian access points be paved and be
up to eight feet in width, meeting Township standards for a
bike path. Maintenance access points shall be of a slope that is
suitable for access by vehicles and equipment.
(3) Open space ownership. The method(s) to be used to own, preserve
and maintain any preserved open space shall be acceptable to the
Township. The Township shall only approve an open space
development if the applicant proves there will be an acceptable
method to ensure permanent ownership, preservation and
maintenance of land that will not be included in individual home
lots.
(a) The method of ownership and use of any required preserved
open space shall be determined prior to preliminary
subdivision or land development approval. The Township
should be given right of first refusal at the time of such review
to accept proposed open space as public open space. The
Township shall only accept ownership of open space if the
Board of Supervisors has agreed in writing in advance to
accept such ownership. If the preserved open space will not be
owned by the Township, then the preserved open space shall
be permanently preserved by one or a combination of the
following methods that are found to be acceptable to the Board
of Supervisors:
[1] Dedication to the county as public open space, if the
County Commissioners agree in writing to such
dedication.
[2] Dedication to the school district if such Board of Education
agrees in writing to accept such dedication and to use and
maintain the land for school recreation, public recreation,
environmental education and/or related open space.
[3] Dedication to a homeowners association as preserved
open space, with the homeowners legally bound to pay
fees for the maintenance and other expenses of owning
such land, and with such homeowners association being
incorporated with covenants and bylaws providing for the
filing of assessments and/or municipal liens for the
nonpayment of maintenance costs for preserved open
space that is not publicly owned.
[a] Such responsibilities shall be specified as part of each
deed prior to sale of each lot or dwelling unit. The
Township may delay a dedication of maintenance
responsibilities by a developer to a homeowners
§ 203-311 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-311
1:640
association until such association is incorporated and
able to maintain such land.
[4] Dedication of the land to an established nature
conservation organization acceptable to the Board of
Supervisors for maintenance as a nature preserve or
passive recreation area.
[5] Dedication of a permanent conservation easement that
results in the land being used for a Township-approved
crop farming, wholesale tree farm, or an equestrian use,
and which may include one of the allowed dwelling units
on the lot.
[6] Dedication to the State Game Commission, State Fish and
Boat Commission or similar public agency, if such agency
agrees in writing in advance to accept the dedication and
to maintain the land for public recreation.
(b) Legal documents providing for ownership and/or maintenance
of required preserved open space shall be reviewed by the
Township Solicitor and be subject to approval by the Board of
Supervisors prior to recording of the final plan.
(c) A legally binding system shall be established to oversee and
maintain land that will not be publicly owned. The applicant
shall prove compliance with state law governing homeowner
associations. Proper notations shall be required on the
recorded plan. For example, if the preserved open space is
intended to be owned by a homeowners' association as
recreation land, a statement should be included that the
designated open space "shall not be further subdivided and
shall not be used for the construction of any nonrecreation
buildings."
(4) Changes in open space uses. If the required preserved open space
is proposed to be used for purposes that were not authorized in the
Township zoning or final subdivision plan approval, then a revised
Township approval shall be required for the changed use.
F. Steep slopes. Within an open space development, no principal building
shall be placed on slopes of over 25%.
G. Phasing. The development shall include a phasing system that shall be
approved by the Board of Supervisors. Such phases shall ensure that
the requirements of this article will be met after the completion of any
one phase, and that the development could properly function without
the construction of additional phases.
H. Landscaping plan. An application for an open space development
involving over 10 acres shall include a landscape planting and
preservation plan prepared by a registered landscape architect.
§ 203-311 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-311
1:641
§ 203-312. Conservation along creeks.
(1) Such plan shall show the locations, general species and initial sizes
of landscaping to be planted within the preserved open space and
throughout the tract.
(2) Such plan shall also show that existing substantial healthy trees
will be preserved to the maximum extent reasonable. The methods
to ensure preservation during construction shall be described.
(3) Landscaping shall also be used as appropriate to filter views of
denser housing from any adjacent housing that is less dense.
A. Setbacks. No new building (except an accessory storage shed with a
floor area of 150 square feet or less), new or expanded vehicle parking,
or business outdoor storage shall be located within 50 feet from the top
of the bank of a perennial creek. This minimum setback shall be
increased to 75 feet from the top of the bank of a perennial creek within
the AR and CO Zoning Districts. A perennial creek shall be defined as a
waterway shown as a perennial creek on the United States Geological
Survey quadrangle maps. [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
B. Standards. To the maximum extent feasible:
(1) Any street or driveway crossing of a perennial creek shall be
approximately perpendicular to the creek.
(2) Existing healthy natural vegetation adjacent to a creek should be
preserved.
(3) Areas within the setback established by this section shall be
preserved in their natural state, except for: planting of trees and
shrubs, erosion control improvements, public recreation
improvements and necessary utility, street and driveway crossings.
Low-maintenance landscaping is encouraged along creeks and
other areas where maintenance would otherwise prove difficult.
C. Vegetation. Where the majority of the existing trees and/or shrubs are
removed from areas within the setback distance provided by
§ 203-312A as part of, or in preparation to, a subdivision, land
development or construction of a new building, then new trees and
shrubs shall be planted and maintained that will have the same or
better impact upon controlling erosion and filtering pollutants from
runoff as the trees and/or shrubs that were removed.
(1) Publications of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources (including "Stream ReLeaf") and/or the
Chesapeake Bay Commission shall be used as standards for the
planting of the buffer. These publications include recommended
species. Native species of vegetation shall be used. If trees and
plants do not survive, they shall be replaced within 100 days
afterwards by the current owner of the property.
§ 203-311 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-313
1:642
§ 203-313. Optional transfer of development rights ("TDR").
A. Purposes. In addition to serving the overall purposes of this chapter,
this section is intended to:
(1) Encourage the permanent preservation of important farmland and
environmentally sensitive areas;
(2) Direct growth to locations where public water and sewerage
services are available; and
(3) Provide a voluntary method for landowners to be compensated by
the free market to preserve their land.
B. Applicability.
(1) The transfer of development rights shall only officially occur at the
time of final approval of a subdivision or land development plan or a
conditional use approval. The approval of a preliminary plan shall
be conditioned upon compliance with this section. As part of a
preliminary and final plan application, the applicant shall present a
draft conservation easement on the "sending property" and a
written, signed and notarized agreement by the owner of the
"sending property" acknowledging and agreeing to the application.
(2) The conservation easement shall be drafted so that it is binding if
the "receiving property" is granted final subdivision or land
development plan approval. The conservation easement shall be
recorded at the same time as, or prior to, the final plan for the
receiving property.
(a) If a final plan is recorded in phases, then the conservation
easement may be recorded in corresponding phases.
(3) The form of the conservation easement shall be acceptable to the
Board of Supervisors, based upon review by the Township Solicitor
and Planning Commission. The term "conservation easement" shall
include, but not be limited to, an agricultural conservation
easement. In the case of agricultural land, the standard language
for an agricultural conservation easement used by the County
Agricultural Land Preservation Board may be utilized.
(4) A sending property shall be within the CO, AR or R-1 District. A
sending property shall have a minimum lot area of 10 acres.
(5) A receiving property shall be within the R-1 or R-2 District.
(6) The owners of the sending and receiving properties shall
voluntarily commit to participate in the transfer of development
rights. Once such conservation easement is established, it shall be
binding upon all current and future owners of the sending property.
The applicant for the receiving property is responsible to negotiate
with, and pay compensation to, the owner of the sending property
§ 203-313 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-313
1:643
for the conservation easement. Such transaction shall occur
privately, and the value shall be determined by the private market.
The Township is under no obligation to pay the owner of the
sending property, unless the Township purchases the development
rights.
(7) Donations or intermediaries. The right to develop a sending
property may be purchased by or donated to the Township, a
Township Authority, the county or an established incorporated
nonprofit organization whose mission includes preservation of
agricultural land or natural features. A permanent conservation
easement shall be established on the sending property at the time
of such purchase or donation. In such case, the right to develop
such dwelling units may be held for a maximum of 10 years, before
being used on a receiving property(ies).
C. Definitions.
RECEIVING PROPERTY  A lot(s) that is approved to permit a higher
density than would otherwise be permitted as a condition of the
restriction of development on sending property.
SENDING PROPERTY  A lot(s) or portion of a lot that is restricted
by a conservation easement or farmland preservation easement as a
condition of approval of a higher density on the "receiving property"
than would otherwise be permitted.
D. Determination of density.
(1) Yield plans shall be presented by the applicant. One yield plan shall
be presented for the receiving property and one for the sending
property. Such yield plans shall be a level of detail typically found in
a sketch plan, including showing potential lots and roads, steep
slopes, 100-year floodplains and suspected wetlands. Such yield
plans shall estimate the number of new dwelling units that could be
lawfully constructed on each property under Township regulations
without any transfer of development rights. Detailed septic perc
tests are not required for such sketches, but new septic systems
shall not be assumed to be possible in areas with severe soil and
slope limitations.
(2) Such yield plans shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer, with
advice by the Township Engineer, to determine whether each
represents a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of
dwelling units possible on each site, both physically and legally. If
such estimates are determined to not be accurate, the applicant
shall be required by the Zoning Officer to revise such yield plan
until it is accurate.
(3) Based upon the yield plans, permission to develop the allowed
number of dwelling units may be transferred from the sending
property to the receiving property.
§ 203-313 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-313

(a) For each dwelling unit that would have otherwise been allowed
on the sending property, one additional dwelling unit may be
approved on the receiving property.
(b) If one or more lots each include less than one acre of lot area
and are not served by Township-approved central sewage
service, such lots shall not be used to transfer density.
(c) If, for example, the yield plan determines that 10 new dwelling
units would be allowed under current zoning on the sending
property, and the sending property will be preserved by a
conservation easement, then the right to develop 10 additional
dwelling units shall be transferred to the receiving property.
(d) The development of the receiving property shall still comply
with all other requirements of this chapter, except for the
maximum density, which shall be regulated by this section.
(4) A partial transfer of the allowed dwelling units shall also be
allowed, depending upon the amount of land affected by the
permanent conservation easement.
(a) For example, if under current zoning, five dwelling units would
be possible on the western portion of a lot and six dwelling
units on the eastern portion, the owner may choose to transfer
the right to develop five dwelling units by placing a permanent
conservation easement on the western portion. The owner
would then still have the right to develop the eastern portion
under the zoning in effect at the time of a future development
application for that eastern portion.
(b) If only a portion of a lot would be affected by the conservation
easement, the applicant shall prove that the conservation
easement would permanently preserve a contiguous area of
rectangular (or similar regular) shape that would relate to the
number of dwelling units that would otherwise be allowed on
such portion of the lot.
(c) Where a conservation easement would be established in
phases over time, each phase shall be contiguous with a
previous conservation easement, unless the applicant proves to
the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that there is a valid
public purpose for the easement to not be contiguous.
(5) The receiving property shall be permitted to include the increased
total number of dwelling units above the number that would
otherwise be permitted, as approved by the Township based upon
the yield plan.
(6) The development of the receiving property shall comply with all
other requirements of this chapter, except that the following
§ 203-313 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-313
1:645
§ 203-314. Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) Overlay
District.
requirements shall be reduced, provided the maximum overall
density for the TDR is not exceeded:
(a) For a receiving property within the R-1 District, for singlefamily
detached dwellings, a minimum lot area of 12,000
square feet and the minimum lot width shall be 90 feet shall
apply, provided both central sewage and central water services
are provided.
(b) For a receiving property within the R-2 District, for a singlefamily
detached dwelling, the minimum lot area shall be
reduced to 8,000 square feet, and the minimum lot width may
be reduced to 60 feet.
(c) For a receiving property within the R-2 District, for other
allowed dwelling types, the minimum average lot area per
dwelling unit shall be reduced to 6,000 square feet.
(7) Utilities. To receive a transfer of development rights, any lot that
includes less than one acre per dwelling unit on the receiving
property shall be served by Township-approved central sanitary
sewerage service and central water service.
(8) The transfer of development rights shall not be combined with
reduced lot sizes and other incentives concerning open space
development or traditional neighborhood development.
E. Once a conservation easement is established under a transfer of
development rights, it shall be permanent, regardless of whether the
receiving property is developed. The approval to develop the receiving
property in a higher density shall be treated in the same manner as any
other final subdivision or land development approval. The Board of
Supervisors may extend time limits to complete the development of the
receiving property in response to a written request.
(1) If an approved development on the receiving property is not
completed, the Township may allow a new development application
to be submitted to use such transferred number of dwelling units
on the same area of land. In such case, the number of additional
dwelling units that are allowed shall be added to the number of
dwelling units that would be allowed under the Township
ordinances in effect at the time of the new development
application.
A. Purposes. Traditional neighborhood development ("TND") is primarily
intended to:
§ 203-313 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:646
(1) Encourage new development to occur in a manner that will be
consistent with the traditional patterns and scale of development
and mix of uses that occurred in the region before 1946;
(2) Promote a mix of diverse but compatible types of neighborhood
development;
(3) Avoid development that would be inconsistent with the character of
the community, and could cause inefficient patterns of sprawled
development;
(4) Encourage a blending of recreation areas, preserved natural
features, compatible institutional uses, and a mix of housing at a
medium density, including housing intended to be affordable to
middle-income persons;
(5) Provide for reasonably safe and convenient pedestrian, bicycle and
vehicle circulation, with an emphasis on avoiding conflicts between
vehicles backing out of garages across sidewalks;
(6) Encourage persons to live, work, shop, attend religious services
and enjoy recreation within the Township;
(7) Encourage the creation of a sense of place, feelings of belonging
and a community spirit that promotes social interaction and
volunteerism;
(8) Encourage the location of principal nonresidential uses with
distinguished architectural features at prominent locations around
a Central Commons, to serve as a focal point for the development;
(9) Serve the purposes for traditional neighborhood development as
listed in the State Municipalities Planning Code, as amended;
(10) Allow a TND under this set of development standards to have a
higher density and a wider range of uses than would otherwise be
allowed, in return for a higher level of site design and preservation
of common open space land; and
(11) Promote the placement of new single-family detached dwellings
abutting preexisting single-family detached dwellings on abutting
lots, when feasible.
B. Applicability. The TND Overlay District is shown on the Zoning Map.
Within the TND Overlay District, in addition to development allowed
under the conventional underlying zoning district, an applicant shall
also have an option of developing a TND under the provisions of this
§ 203-314. A TND shall be permitted by right within the TND Overlay
District. If an area of land is not within the TND Overlay District, then
an applicant may request that the Board of Supervisors consider a
zoning map amendment to add the TND Overlay District to that land
area.
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:647
(1) If an applicant chooses to utilize these TND provisions, then all of
the requirements of this § 203-314 shall apply. All of the provisions
of this chapter and other Township regulations shall remain in full
force, except for provisions modified by this § 203-314. Where
§ 203-314 and another Zoning Ordinance or Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance provision apply to the same matter,
§ 203-314 shall apply in place of that other provision.
(2) Minimum tract size: 80 acres. However, if one TND has been
approved to include a minimum 80 acres, than an adjacent tract
may have a minimum tract size of 20 acres, provided that the
second TND is designed to be consistent with the first TND,
including compatible architectural standards with the first TND
and a logical extension of streets. The term "tract size" shall
include the lot area of all lots prior to subdivision and land
development, but after deleting existing legal rights-of-way of
preexisting public streets.
(3) Stub streets: Any TND shall be designed with stub street right-ofway
extending to the edges of the tract if the Township determines
that there is potential for interconnected streets onto an adjacent
tract. The developer of the adjacent tract shall be responsible to
fund the completion of the construction of such street extensions at
the time they would be needed. Until such time, the stub right-ofway
shall be maintained in vegetative ground cover. Any TND shall
be designed with streets that can be interconnected with adjacent
lands to the maximum extent feasible and desirable, in the
determination of the Township.
(4) Master plan: The TND shall be developed following a single master
plan. Consistent with final plan approvals, individual portions of the
TND may be owned and constructed by different entities, provided
there is compliance with the overall master plan and the phasing
plan.
C. Master plan for a TND.
(1) Before any use is approved or lot is subdivided for a TND, the
applicant shall submit and have approved an overall master plan.
Such master plan shall be submitted as part of or prior to a
preliminary plan submission for a "traditional neighborhood
development." Such master plan should address coordinated
vehicle access from all adjacent land owned, equitably owned or
otherwise controlled by the applicant. If the applicant's land
extends into an adjacent municipality or zoning district, then it is
requested that the master plan also show such area to plan for a
coordinated road and infrastructure system.
(a) The master plan shall be fully coordinated with any existing,
proposed or approved development on adjacent land, including
providing for pedestrian and bicycle access to adjacent tracts.
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:648
(b) Landscaped open space and recreation areas shall be
interspersed within the TND. Pedestrian and motor vehicle
routes shall be laid out to complement the interaction between
the commercial core of the TND and residential areas.
(2) The Overall master plan shall show proposed streets, alleys,
cartway widths, approximate lot lines and dimensions, common
open spaces, recreation areas, major pedestrian and bicycle
pathways, parking areas, major detention basins and proposed
types of housing and nonresidential uses. The master plan shall
designate certain areas for primarily commercial development,
certain areas as preserved open space, and certain areas for
various types and densities of residential development. The intent
is to have the higher density areas closer to the proposed
commercial core, and lower residential densities adjacent to
preexisting single-family detached housing developments on
adjacent lots.
(3) The master plan and application for the traditional neighborhood
development shall be reviewed by the Township Planning
Commission and the Board of Supervisors. After any modifications,
the master plan shall become part of the approved preliminary plan
under the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. Once
preliminary plan approval is granted for the traditional
neighborhood development, then individual lots may be submitted
for final plan approval under the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, and uses allowed by this section may
occur as permitted by right uses.
(a) The master plan is not required to include the same level of
engineering detail as a preliminary subdivision plan.
Stormwater calculations, construction details, erosion and
sedimentation control plans, profiles and similar engineering
details are not required at the master plan stage. The master
plan shall include sufficient information to accurately show
existing conditions and the proposed layout of the homes,
nonresidential uses, lots, open space and streets.
(4) Changes to the master plan may occur, provided there is
compliance with Township Ordinances. The Township may require
that a revised preliminary subdivision or land development plan be
submitted and approved if there are substantial changes from the
previously approved preliminary plan.
(5) The master plan shall designate various areas of the TND for
various types or ranges of uses and types of housing. The intent is
to have most business uses and denser housing clustered at one
area of the development. The intent is to have less-dense housing
towards the perimeter of the TND, particularly adjacent to
preexisting single-family detached housing that is outside of the
TND.
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:649
D. Overall requirements. A TND shall meet all of the following
requirements:
(1) The existing street system shall be extended into the new
development, to the maximum extent feasible. Streets shall be
interconnected through the development. The development shall
have a central focal point, such as a central commons, park,
commercial area that is similar to a historic main street and/or
allowed institutional building. Streets or trails should lead towards
this focal point.
(a) A cul-de-sac street shall be permitted only where the applicant
proves that there is no reasonable alternative. Street linkages
shall be provided to allow connections with future phases of
development or adjacent tracts. Where direct street access is
not practical between two areas, then the Township Board of
Supervisors may require the provision of bicycle and
pedestrian access using an easement.
(2) A minimum of 60% of the dwelling units shall have access to a front
door accessing onto an unenclosed front porch with a minimum
depth of five feet and a minimum length of eight feet. Such porch
shall be covered by a permanent roof. Such porch shall not be
enclosed, now or in the future.
(a) A minimum of 50% of single family dwelling units at the
intersection of two or more public streets shall have a porch
that wraps around the front and side of the dwelling, or shall
have separate front and side porches facing onto the streets.
(3) The applicant shall prove that proper site planning and
architectural design will be used to minimize visual impact of
garages and garage doors as viewed from the front of the lot. A
minimum of 50% of the dwelling units shall not have garage doors
for two or more motor vehicles facing onto a street at the front of
the dwelling. The placement of garages along rear or side alleys or
to the rear of the lot with a side driveway is encouraged. No garage
shall be located with a smaller setback from the front lot line along
a street than the living quarters of the dwelling. For single-family
detached dwellings that have a front facing garage, the garage
should be setback a minimum of 20 feet greater than the front of
the dwelling. No garage or carport shall be permitted within five
feet from the right-of-way of an alley. (However, on-street parallel
parking may be approved along an alley under other provisions of
this § 203-314.)
(a) Garage doors shall not make up more than 50% of the front
street level of the facade of a dwelling. Driveways and offstreet
parking spaces shall not make up more than 50% of the
land area of the front yard between the front of a dwelling and
the street right-of-way.
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:650
(b) All streets and alleys shall have a right-of-way, whether public
or private.
(c) See § 203-314I, which allows on-street parking to be counted
towards off-street parking requirements. To the maximum
extent feasible, vehicle parking, carports and garages shall be
placed to the rear or side of lots, preferably with rear or side
access. For example, the following alternative methods of
providing parking are permitted and encouraged:
[1] A rear landscaped shared parking court or shared carport
structure;
[2] A garage placed towards the rear of the lot, with a side
driveway that is of minimal width within the front yard and
then widens in front of the garage;
[3] A detached rear garage or rear individual parking pad or
side-entry garage accessed from a rear alley or side street;
[4] Decks built to extend over garages or over driveways
leading to garages; or
[5] A landscaped shared parking court connected to a street,
provided that parked vehicles do not need to back out onto
a through-street and provided that all paving is setback a
minimum of 20 feet from any dwelling (other than a front
porch).
(d) If driveways pass through the front of the lot (such as to reach
detached rear garages), then it is encouraged to place
driveways of adjacent dwellings immediately adjacent to each
other. This would allow the driveway on each lot to be more
narrow than would otherwise be possible. However, each
property owner shall still be responsible for their own half of
the driveway, and each half shall be wide enough to allow a
passenger car to travel on each lot. As an alternative, the
Township may approve shared driveways with maintenance by
a legally binding homeowners' association.
(4) All principal buildings shall have a minimum roof pitch of 4/12 or
have the appearance of such a roof pitch as viewed from the street,
except a flat roof may be approved for townhouses or connected
commercial buildings if the buildings have a decorative cornice.
Variations in rooflines are specifically encouraged.
(5) Sidewalks or other Township-approved pedestrian pathways shall
be provided along both sides of each street, unless a modification
or waiver is granted in writing by the Board of Supervisors under
the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. The width of
sidewalks shall be a minimum of eight feet along a commercial
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:651
main street (which may include street tree wells) and a minimum
of five feet in other locations.
(a) A sidewalk in a commercial main street area shall be
constructed primarily of decorative masonry or material that
has the appearance of decorative masonry. This may include
interlocking brick pavers or concrete pavers or patterned
concrete that has the appearance of brick. The use of dry laid
pavers on a suitable subsurface of concrete, sand or stone and
stone dust is encouraged.
(b) Pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided in the commercial
main street area using materials and colors that visually
distinguish the crosswalk from the street surface and that
include some texture. The use of pavers, patterned concrete or
stamped textured asphalt is encouraged.
(c) The materials, depths and cross sections of the sidewalks and
crosswalks shall be subject to approval by the Township, after
review by the Township Engineer.
(6) Commercial. Allowed commercial uses and their parking areas
shall occupy a minimum of 5% and a maximum of 15% of the total
land area of the traditional neighborhood development. This
percentage may be increased to 20% if the commercial area will be
adjacent to an arterial street. No such maximum percentage shall
apply in portions of a TND that are within a commercial district. A
principal commercial use shall be set back a minimum of 200 feet
from any dwelling outside of the TND that existed at the time of the
enactment of this section.
(a) If a new TND is proposed adjacent to a previously approved
TND, and if the first TND included a commercial area, then the
second TND is not required to include commercial uses.
(b) Off-street parking for a commercial use shall not be located
between the commercial use building and the front lot line
along a street. Off-street parking shall be located to the side or
rear of a commercial building.
(c) The majority of commercial uses shall be placed in a Main
Street style commercial area, with the businesses fronting
upon a through street, and with parking being on street or to
the rear or side of the businesses. Buildings in commercial
areas of the TND are encouraged to have dwelling units or
offices placed above first-floor commercial uses.
(d) Bulb-out curbs, raised textured crosswalks and similar traffic
calming measures are encouraged to be used in the main
street area.
(7) Housing types.
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:652
(a) The allowed housing types within a TND are listed in
§ 203-314E.
(b) Any new dwelling units located within 150 feet from a singlefamily
detached dwelling that existed or approved outside of
the TND at the time that the TND Overlay District was applied
to the subject tract shall be a new single-family detached
dwelling. If such existing single-family detached dwelling is on
a lot of over 20,000 square feet, then any new dwellings built
within 150 feet of such dwelling area shall have a minimum lot
area of 8,000 square feet. The Township may require that a
twenty-foot-wide planting area with a naturalistic mix of
deciduous canopy trees, flowering trees, evergreen trees and
shrubs be planted along the perimeter of the TND tract where
there are concerns about compatibility with the adjacent uses.
Such planting area may overlap a rear yard, but shall be free of
buildings and fences.
(c) A minimum of 30% of the dwelling units shall be single-family
detached dwellings.
(8) Any alleys shall be designed to discourage through traffic. All
streets, whether public or private, shall be constructed following
Township roadbed specifications for a public street. Any alley shall
be constructed with six inches of crushed stone, two inches of
BCBC and one inch of binder course, unless a modification is
granted by the Board of Supervisors.
(a) Alleys shall have a minimum paved width of 12 feet if limited to
one-way traffic and 16 feet if allowing two-way traffic.
Additional width shall be required if any parallel parking is
provided. The right-of-way for an alley shall be at least four feet
wider than the cartway (two feet on each side of the cartway).
An alley shall have adequate sight distance at all corners and
intersections of alleys.
(b) Any alleys shall be maintained by a legally binding
homeowners association, at no expense to the Township.
(9) New streets shall be sufficient in width to allow on-street parking
along at least one side of each street, and to provide room for
bicycle riding, unless a separate bicycle pathway is provided. The
Township may require a prohibition of parking on one side of a
street if the street does not have sufficient width for parking on
both sides.
(10) Any commercial uses that are developed shall be located in an area
that is adjacent to a street that is similar to a traditional main street
of a historic borough or a Central Commons that is immediately
adjacent to such a street. One or more prominent sites adjacent to a
Central Commons should be proposed for a principal
nonresidential use. The subdivision approval for the traditional
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:653
neighborhood development may allow for two or more alternative
uses for certain sites, to allow a developer with reasonable
flexibility to attract different uses.
(11) Public transit. An applicant for a Traditional Development
Neighborhood shall provide evidence that they have contacted the
provider of public transit services and requested the provision of
service to the development once it is significantly complete. If
public transit service is intended to eventually be provided, the
applicant shall show that provisions have been made for convenient
public transit stops. The Township may require the applicant to
construct one suitable shelter for persons waiting for a public bus.
The applicant shall also contact the school district and request
comment about appropriate school bus stops within or adjacent to
the TND.
(12) Streetlights. The applicant shall install streetlights meeting
minimum requirements of the Township and the electric provider.
Such streetlights shall be of sturdy construction, have a decorative
design similar to designs used more than 50 years ago, be dark in
color (such as black, dark gray or dark green), and have a
maximum total height of 22 feet. Streetlights shall be provided at
all street intersections and at other locations approved by the
Township as part of the subdivision and land development approval
process.
(13) Architecture. The intent is to have unified and consistent
architectural styles, while avoiding monotony. The applicant shall
establish legally enforceable provisions controlling the styles of
architecture, rooflines, porches and the general types of exterior
materials in such as manner as to incorporate the best features of
traditional architecture commonly found in boroughs and villages
in Pennsylvania, unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
the Board of Supervisors that a more-contemporary architectural
design would be appropriate. Such features shall include front
porches on most dwellings, landscaped front yards, nonprominent
garage doors, varied rooflines and use of masonry on most facades.
The emphasis shall be upon sides of a building visible from a street.
(a) Such provisions shall be approved and sealed by a registered
architect. The substance of such draft provisions shall be
provided to the Township in writing for review at the time of
preliminary subdivision submission. Such provisions shall be
subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors as a condition
of final subdivision and land development approval. Any future
substantive changes to the architectural provisions established
under this section shall require approval by resolution of the
Board of Supervisors.
(b) Such provisions shall not be designed to require excessive
uniformity in design, nor to restrict home purchasers to a
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:654
single design, but instead to encourage high-quality design
with a consistent character. Such provisions shall limit
monotony and excessive modernity in architectural design.
Standards should also be established for the design of fencing.
(c) The architectural provisions shall promote the use of display
windows facing onto the public street on a majority of
commercial principal buildings in the development. Blank
walls without window and door openings shall be avoided
facing onto a public street. Where window openings are not
feasible, then enclosed display windows may be used.
(d) The Township may require that some or all of the architectural
provisions be recorded and/or be included in a development
agreement with the Township. The Township shall have the
authority to ensure that a system continues to be in place to
enforce the architectural provisions that were required by the
Township. However, the Township shall accept no
responsibility to directly enforce private deed restrictions upon
individual properties.
(e) The architectural provisions shall promote use of front or side
porches, and be designed to minimize the visual impact of
garage doors as viewed from a street.
(f) The architectural provisions shall require use of decorative
masonry, or materials with a closely similar appearance, on
specified minimum percentages of the front facades of a
majority of the principal buildings in the development. A
maximum of 40% of the dwelling units shall have a front facade
that is composed primarily of vinyl siding.
(g) The architectural provisions shall promote varied rooflines,
overhangs and/or setbacks along attached dwelling units.
(h) The architectural provisions shall promote the use of
architectural detailing and features, such as decorative
porches, decorative cornices, shutters on multiple principal
buildings in the development.
(i) The architectural provisions shall address the locations of front
doors, particularly to ensure that most dwellings and business
uses have a front door facing onto a street at the front of the
building.
(j) Buildings of over 150 feet in length shall be designed to have
the appearance of smaller connected buildings.
(k) Such provisions shall address minimum sizes of street level
front windows, roof pitches as viewed from the street, siding
materials, porches, front stoops, front awnings, screening of
rooftop mechanical equipment and similar matters. Such
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:655
provisions shall also address allowed materials for fences
visible from a street.
(14) Utility meters. Utility meters larger than 100 square inches each
shall not be attached to the front of a dwelling in a manner that
makes them highly visible from a street. If utility meters are
attached to the front of the dwelling, they should have colors
similar to adjacent building materials and/or should be screened by
landscaping.
E. Allowed uses.
(1) The following uses shall be allowed within an approved traditional
neighborhood development, provided all the uses are consistent
with the overall master plan:
(a) Single-family detached dwellings.
(b) Twin dwellings, side-by-side, with each dwelling on its own feesimple
or condominium lot.

such uses in the approved master plan. These dwelling units
may be designed as "live work units" that encourage a person
to work on the first floor and live in the upper stories.
(n) Indoor or outdoor noncommercial recreation facilities owned
by the Township or a property owner association.
(o) Preserved open space or a nature preserve.
(p) Golf course with a minimum acreage of 50 acres.
(q) Major and minor home occupations and accessory uses shall be
addressed in the same manner as the underlying zoning
district, except that a major home occupation shall be
permitted by right in an area of the TND that is approved by
the Township for commercial uses.
(r) A second dwelling unit in an allowed single-family detached
dwelling building or above the garage of a single-family
detached dwelling, provided:
[1] No more than 5% of such dwellings shall have a second
dwelling unit;
[2] The locations of the lots allowed to have a second dwelling
unit shall be designated on the master plan; and
[3] The second dwelling unit shall not include more than 1,000
square feet of habitable indoor floor area and shall not
include more than two bedrooms.
* Uses marked with an asterisk shall only be permitted
adjacent to or within 200 feet from a Central
Commons within a TND or along a traditional
downtown-style main street, unless the uses are
placed within a rehabilitated historic building.
Business buildings shall have their main pedestrian
entrance facing a street or a Central Commons. No
outdoor commercial storage shall be permitted unless
it is completely screened by landscaping and/or
buildings.
F. Preserved open space.

permanent preserved open space.
(a) The minimum amount of preserved open space shall be
reduced from 20% to 15% of the total lot area of the tract if the
applicant commits to construct and continue to provide a
minimum of three of the following types of recreational
facilities, and provided such facilities are available at a
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:657
minimum for use of the residents and their invited guests with
no charge that exceeds the costs of operating and maintaining
the facility. A minimum of one of the three recreation facilities
shall be a community center with a minimum floor area of
2,500 square feet built around an ADA-accessible meeting
room for community meetings and social events. That
community center may be temporarily used as a sales office

(b) A minimum of 25% of the required preserved open space shall
be in an interconnected area that is linked together with a
looping recreation trail. The preserved open space shall meet
the definition of "open space, preserved or common" in
§ 203-202.
[1] SALDO. This open space requirement shall be in place of
any recreation land or fee requirements in the Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance, provided that a
minimum of 50% of the required preserved open space is
improved for active and passive recreation purposes that
is open to use by the residents of the TND, at a minimum. A
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:658
payment of a fee in lieu of providing open space required
by this section shall not be allowed for a TND.

walkways/paths and trees.
(2) At least a portion of the preserved open space shall be provided
within at least one Central Commons with a minimum lot area of
20,000 square feet.
(a) The majority of the Central Commons should be planted so as
to eventually result in a canopy of deciduous trees over areas
of the Commons that are not planned for active recreation.
Existing trees may be retained to serve the same purposes, if
found acceptable by the Township Shade Tree Commission.
(b) The required Central Commons shall have a minimum width
and minimum length of 60 feet.
(c) The required Central Commons shall include benches of
durable construction and hard surface pathways. The majority
of the pathways in a Central Commons shall be ADAaccessible.
(3) Stormwater detention basins and drainage channels shall not be
used to meet the minimum common open space requirements,
except for areas that the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
Township Board of Supervisors would be able to be attractively
maintained and be usable for recreation during the vast majority of
weather conditions or that would have the appearance of a natural
scenic pond.

(d) Side yards: minimum five feet each, except zero where
buildings are approved to be attached. Commercial buildings
shall be allowed to be attached to each other within the
approved commercial portion of the development. Each twin
dwelling unit shall have one side yard, while a side yard shall
be required for each end townhouse unit. A detached garage
located to the rear of the lot shall have a minimum side yard
setback of three feet. If a garage is only connected to a
dwelling by a breezeway, it may be considered to be attached
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:660
or detached by the applicant for the purposes of meeting
setback requirements.
[1] For a detached principal building, the subdivision plan
may be approved with one side yard wider than the other
to allow wider use by the residents of the larger side yard
and/or to provide for a side driveway to rear parking. In
such case, one side yard may be a minimum of three feet,
provided the total width of the two side yards equals a
minimum of 10 feet.
(e) Rear yard for a principal nonresidential building: minimum 30
feet.
(f) Rear yard for a vehicle garage serving a dwelling or a dwelling
unit that is allowed to be above a garage: minimum of five feet.
A deck attached to a dwelling may extend into the rear yard
and may extend over a vehicle garage, provided the deck is not
enclosed.
(g) Each dwelling unit, other than an apartment, shall have a
minimum of 300 square feet of usable outdoor space for the
exclusive use of the residents of that dwelling unit. If a singlefamily
detached dwelling is allowed to have an accessory
dwelling, then the two dwellings together shall provide 300
square feet of such outdoor space. Such outdoor private space
may be a yard, garden, patio, porch or unenclosed deck or a
combination of such features. Measures shall be used to
provide some measure of privacy for residents in rear yards,
such as use of decorative walls, fencing, berming, latticework,
awnings or landscaping.
(h) See provisions in § 203-803 that require two front yards for
corner lots.
(i) Swimming pools and accessory buildings that are not vehicle
garages shall have a minimum side yard and rear yard setback
of three feet.
(j) A maximum of 20% of the single-family detached, twin or
townhouse dwelling units are not required to have a minimum
lot width directly along a street-right-of-way, provided each
dwelling unit:
[1] Has a minimum lot width of 20 feet along an alley; and
[2] Fronts upon a landscaped common open space with a
paved or concrete sidewalk or pathway that provides
pedestrian access to a street.
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:661
(k) A maximum of five feet of the required front yard setback may
be used for an unenclosed front porch, stoop, steps,
handicapped ramp, awning, or canopy.
** In place of individual fee-simple lots meeting these
dimensional requirements, an applicant may choose to
utilize a condominium form of ownership. In such case,
the lots shall be laid out so that the dimensional and
coverage requirements would be physically able to be met
as if the dwellings were on fee-simple lots. However, for
a condominium development, the actual lot lines do not
need to be legally established.
(7) Parking setback. No parking area of five or more spaces shall be
located within 30 feet from a contiguous lot line of a dwelling that
is outside the perimeter of the TND and that existed prior to the
enactment of this section.
(8) Maximum overall density. The maximum overall density of the
traditional neighborhood development shall be determined as
follows, as calculated in acres (and decimals):
(a) Start with the total land area of the development tract, after
deleting existing rights-of-way of existing streets.
(b) Delete 75% of all areas of land with a slope exceeding 25% and
delete 50% of the area of lands with a slope over 15% to 25%
from Subsection G(8)(a) above.
(c) Delete 50% of the area of lands within the 100-year floodplain
from Subsection G(8)(a) above.
(d) Multiply the resulting acreage by the following dwelling units
per acre to result in the maximum number of permitted
dwelling units within the development. See bonuses in
Subsection G(9) below.
[1] For acreage in the AR Agricultural Residential District:
two dwelling units per acre.
[2] For acreage in the R-1 District: four dwelling units per
acre.
[3] For acreage in the R-2 District: six dwelling units per acre.
Note: This method of calculating density does not require
the deletion of stormwater detention basins, shared
parking areas, new streets, new preserved/common open
space, new alleys or similar features. Therefore, the
actual density that could be achieved on a "net" piece of
land would be higher than the above numbers.
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:662
(e) Each three beds in a nursing home or personal care center
shall be counted the same as one dwelling unit for the purposes
of controlling density.
(9) Density bonuses:
(a) As an option to the applicant, the applicant may apply for
conditional use approval from the Board of Supervisors to
approve the following increases in the maximum density
provided in Subsection G(8) above. In such case, only the
increase in density shall need conditional use approval.
[Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
[1] If the applicant proves that the architectural standards
required by § 203-314D(13) will result in excellence in
traditional architectural beyond the minimum
requirements of this chapter, the maximum density may be
increased by a maximum of 0.5 additional dwelling unit
per acre.
[2] The maximum density may be increased by a maximum of
0.5 additional dwelling unit per acre if the applicant
commits to provide a minimum of 30% of the total tract
area in common open space.
[3] The maximum density may be increased by a maximum of
0.5 additional dwelling unit per acre if the applicant
commits to construct substantial recreation improvements
and landscaping beyond the amounts of landscaping and
improvements that would otherwise be required. The
market value of the additional recreational improvements
and landscaping shall exceed a minimum of $15,000 per
each additional dwelling unit that is allowed.
[4] The maximum density may also be increased through use
of the age-restricted housing bonus provided in § 203-315.
(10) Maximum building height: 45 feet or three stories, whichever is
more restrictive. See exceptions in § 203-802 and definition in
§ 203-202.
H. Landscaping and street trees.
(1) See § 203-804. A green area with a minimum diameter of 4.5 feet
shall be provided to accommodate street trees between the curb
and the sidewalk, unless an alternative location for street trees is
specifically approved by the Township. Tree wells may be used.
Areas that are between the dwelling and the street curb and that
are not used for approved sidewalks shall be maintained in a
vegetative ground cover and landscaping.
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:663
(2) A minimum of one deciduous street tree shall be required for an
average of each 50 feet of street frontage on each side of each
existing or proposed street. A uniform separation is not required
between street trees. Such street trees shall have a minimum trunk
width when planted of two inches, measured five inches above the
ground level. The species shall be approved by the Township Shade
Tree Commission.
(3) The site design of a traditional neighborhood development shall
carefully consider and maximize the preservation of existing
healthy attractive trees with a trunk width of six inches or more,
measured at a height of 3.5 feet above the ground level.
(4) A landscape planting plan shall be prepared by a registered
landscape architect. Such plan may specify a range of species in
various locations and may include typical planting locations
without specifying the exact location of each plant. Such plan shall
state the minimum initial sizes of landscaping. Such landscaping
plan shall be offered for review by the Planning Commission and
Shade Tree Commission and shall be approved by the Supervisors
as part of the subdivision plan.
I. Parking incentive. An applicant may meet a maximum of 50% of the offstreet
parking space requirements of adjacent uses by counting onstreet
spaces parallel to the curb along a local street or along an alley.
This provision shall be permitted only:
(1) For spaces along the same side of a street along curb that is
directly contiguous to the set of lots being served, or a new alley
within a TND, and provided the spaces are within 200 feet of each
use they serve; and
(2) If the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of
Supervisors that the street or alley would be sufficiently wide to
allow the parking, and that there are no unusual safety hazards
involved, compared to typical on-street parking at other locations;
and
(3) If the applicant proves that such number of parking spaces could be
legally accommodated along the street, considering the locations of
driveways, fire hydrants and street corners.
Note: Required parking may also be reduced through § 203-602F,
particularly for shared parking among uses.
J. Deed restrictions/covenants. The applicant shall submit a written
statement of the proposed substance of deed restrictions or similar
controls that would affect matters addressed in this chapter.
K. Association provisions. If applicable, a draft set of homeowner
association or condominium association provisions shall be submitted
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-314
1:664
for legal acceptance by the Township Solicitor prior to recording of the
final subdivision plan.
L. SALDO and street standards. As authorized by the traditional
neighborhood provisions of the State Municipalities Planning Code, the
Township Board of Supervisors shall have the authority to modify
specific street and other requirements of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, without proof of hardship, in order to result in
a development that is pedestrian-oriented and that promotes low-speed
traffic.
(1) For example, the Board of Supervisors may approve reduced street
cartway widths, street right-of-way widths and street curve radii.
(2) The Board of Supervisors may also defer certain submission
requirements from the preliminary to the final plan stage.
(3) The applicant shall submit a request for modifications in writing,
which shall state the reasons why the modification would be
consistent with the purposes for a traditional neighborhood
development as stated in this chapter and the State Municipalities
Planning Code and would be in the public interest while protecting
public safety.
(4) The following street right-of-way and cartway widths shall be
allowed for new streets that are not dedicated to the Township or
the state, in addition to options that are allowed under the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance:
(a) A street fronting upon commercial development with two-way
traffic may be constructed with two travel lanes of 12 feet
each, diagonal parking lanes of 18 feet each or eight feet wide
parallel parking lanes, a 4.5 feet wide planting area for street
trees using tree wells on each side of the street, pedestrian
sidewalks on each side of the street that are a minimum of
eight feet in width (which may count walkable parts of tree
wells as sidewalks), and a right-of-way width that extends a
minimum of nine feet on either side of the curbline.
(b) A street with two-way traffic that does not front upon
commercial development may be constructed with two travel
lanes of 10 feet each and eight feet wide parallel parking, a 4.5
feet wide planting strip with street trees on each side of the
street, pedestrian sidewalks on each side of the street that are
a minimum of five feet and a minimum right-of-way width that
extends a minimum of 9.5 feet on either side of the curbline.
(5) Any street within the TND Overlay District, whether public or
private, shall meet the same minimum construction material
requirements as any new street intended to be dedicated to the
Township under Township ordinances.
§ 203-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-314
1:665
§ 203-315. Age-restricted residential development.
(6) The development shall be subject to review by Township Fire
Officials to assist the Township in determining whether sufficient
access points, cartway widths and turning radii will be provided for
access by emergency vehicles and equipment.
M. Access controls. The applicant shall prove that the development
involves a fully coordinated interior traffic access system that
minimizes the number of streets and driveways entering onto a State
highway.
N. Phasing. A phasing plan shall be submitted for the TND. The applicant
shall show that each phase of the TND would be able to function
properly and meet Township requirements if later phases of the TND
are not completed.
O. Signs. For commercial uses, signs shall be allowed meeting the
requirements for signs in the CN district. However, no signs shall be
internally illuminated, and no freestanding sign shall have a height
exceeding eight feet.
A. This § 203-315 provides a density bonus for a residential development
that is age-restricted in compliance with the federal requirements for
"housing for older persons" as specified in the United States Code.
(Note: As of 2006, such provisions were in 42 U.S.C. § 3607.) This
provision shall not change the allowed dwelling types in the district.
This option is available as a by-right bonus in any zoning district where
dwellings are allowed.
B. In order to be approved by the Township as age-restricted residential
Development, every dwelling unit (except one dwelling unit for one
manager) on a tract of land shall be permanently restricted by deed, by
any lease and by notes on the recorded plan to the following occupancy
limitations: 1) a minimum of one head of household of each dwelling
unit shall be age 55 years or older or who is physically disabled as
defined by Social Security disability regulations, and 2) no person
under age 18 shall live in the dwelling unit for more than 30 days in any
calendar year, unless such person has a disability as defined under
federal fair housing regulations. Any violation of such age restrictions
shall be a violation of this chapter. In addition, in order to be approved
as age-restricted development, the applicant shall establish an
appropriate legal entity, such as a property owners' association that has
the duty, authority and responsibility to enforce such age restrictions
over time. If a household met this requirement at the time of initial
occupancy, it shall not be required to move in case of death, divorce or
separation of a resident of that same household.
C. If an entire residential development is approved under this § 203-315,
then the minimum lot area or the minimum average lot area per
dwelling unit, as applicable, shall be reduced by 15%. Alternatively,
§ 203-314 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-315
1:666
§ 203-316. Historic buildings.
where density is stated in terms of a maximum number of dwelling
units per acre, the maximum density may be increased by 15% under
this § 203-315. The minimum side yards may also be reduced by 15%.
An age-restricted residential development shall meet all other
requirements of Township ordinances, including limitations on the
housing types allowed in that zoning district.
D. This density bonus shall only be approved if the development includes
an appropriate system of sidewalks or pathways. At least one looped
portion of a pathway system shall have slopes and a surface that are
intended for use by older persons, with slopes consistent with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or no more than 5%, whichever is
less. [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
A. Purposes. In addition to serving the overall purposes of this chapter,
this section is intended to:
(1) Promote the retention of community character through
preservation of the local heritage by recognition and protection of
historic and architectural resources.
(2) Establish a clear process to review and approve demolition of
designated historic buildings.
(3) Encourage continued use, appropriate rehabilitation and adaptive
reuse of historic buildings.
(4) Implement Sections 603(b), 603(g), 604(1) and 605(2) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code which address
protecting and facilitating the preservation of historic values
through zoning and using zoning to regulate uses and structures at
or near places having unique historic, architectural or patriotic
interest or value.
(5) Strengthen the local economy by promoting heritage tourism,
improving property values and increasing investment in older
buildings.
(6) Carry out recommendations of the Township Comprehensive Plan.
B. Applicability.
(1) This § 203-316 shall apply to any principal building within a V
Village District, except for a building or building addition for which
the Zoning Officer has knowledge that it was built after 1945. The
applicant may provide evidence to the Zoning Officer that a
building was built after 1945. This § 203-316 shall also apply to any
principal building identified on the Historic Buildings Map as an
historic building.
§ 203-315 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-316
1:667
(2) Any partial or complete demolition of a principal building regulated
by this § 203-316 shall only occur in compliance with this section.
(3) Demolition shall be defined as "the dismantling, tearing down,
removal or razing of the exterior of a building, in whole or in part.
This term shall not include changes to the interior of a building,
provided such changes do not alter the structural integrity of the
building." A partial demolition shall include, but not be limited to:
removal of an attached porch roof, removal of porch columns and
removal of exterior architectural features.
C. Historic Buildings Map. An Historic Buildings Map may be adopted as
part of this chapter, or a later amendment of this chapter.
D. Approval of demolition.
(1) A building regulated by this § 203-316 shall not be demolished, in
whole or in part, unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
the Board of Supervisors as a conditional use that one or more of
the following conditions exists:
(a) The existing building cannot feasibly and reasonably be
reused, and that such situation is not the result of intentional
neglect or demolition by neglect by the owner; or
(b) The denial of the demolition would result in unreasonable
economic hardship to the owner, and the hardship was not selfcreated;
or
(c) The demolition is necessary to allow a project to occur that will
have substantial, special and unusual public benefit that would
greatly outweigh the loss of the building regulated by
§ 203-316. For example, a demolition may be needed for a
necessary expansion of an existing public building or to allow a
street improvement that is necessary to alleviate a public
safety hazard; or
(d) The existing building has no historical or architectural
significance and the demolition will not adversely impact upon
the streetscape. To meet this condition, the applicant may
present information concerning the proposed design of any
replacement building or use to show that the proposed
building or use will result in a net improvement to the
streetscape.
(2) For approval of a demolition, the standards of this § 203-316 shall
apply in place of the general conditional use standards. In
reviewing the application, the Board of Supervisors shall consider
the following:
(a) The effect of the demolition on the historical significance,
streetscape and architectural integrity of neighboring historic
§ 203-316 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-316
1:668
buildings and on the historic character of the surrounding
neighborhood.
(b) The feasibility of other alternatives to demolition.
(3) A complete application for the demolition shall be submitted by the
applicant in writing. This application shall include the following:
(a) The name, address and daytime telephone number of the
owner of record and the applicant for the demolition.
(b) Recent exterior photographs of the building proposed for
demolition. If the applicant is alleging that the building cannot
be reused or rehabilitated, then interior photos and floor plans
shall be provided as needed to support the applicant's claim.
(c) A site plan drawn to scale showing existing buildings and the
proposed demolition.
(d) A written statement of the reasons for the demolition.
(e) The proposed use of the site, and a proposed timeline for
development of that proposed use.
(4) Evidence. The applicant shall provide sufficient credible evidence
to justify any claims that a building cannot feasibly be repaired or
reused.
(5) Emergency. The Zoning Officer may issue a permit for the
demolition without compliance with this section if the Building
Inspector certifies in writing that the building represents a clear
and immediate hazard to public safety, and that no other
reasonable alternatives exist to demolition.
(6) In the V District where new construction or vehicle parking is
proposed in place of the demolished building, information about
the proposed use shall be provided prior to approval of the
demolition.
(7) If a principal building is to be demolished, a performance bonding
shall be required to be posted to ensure that the site is adequately
cleared after the demolition, with proper disposal of debris.
(8) A separate demolition permit shall also be required under the
Township Construction Codes, and the applicant shall prove
compliance with State Department of Environmental Protection
requirements for disposal of the debris.
E. Exceptions. Conditional use approval shall not be needed for the
following:
(1) Demolition of accessory buildings or structures.
§ 203-316 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-316
1:669
§ 203-317. Additional requirements for the BC District.
(2) Interior renovations or removal of features (such as a rear porch)
that do not harm the structural stability of the building and that are
not visible from a public street (not including an alley).
(3) Removal of features that were added after 1945, such as a modern
porch or aluminum siding or carport.
(4) Relocation of a building within the Township, provided that the
relocation does not result in a partial or complete demolition that is
regulated by this section.
A. Impervious coverage. The maximum impervious coverage provided in
§ 203-307A may be modified as follows, if the flexibility is used to
provide a substantial buffer adjacent to existing dwellings:
(1) Within a subdivision or land development, the maximum
impervious coverages of certain individual lots may be approved to
be a maximum of 70%, provided that deed restrictions are put into
place to restrict the maximum impervious coverage of other lots to
a lower percentage, so as to ensure that a maximum impervious
coverage of 60% is maintained for the total land area of all lots.
This provision is intended to allow for substantial buffer areas
adjacent to dwellings or for common recreation areas.
(a) For example by deed restrictions, one lot of two acres might
have a maximum impervious coverage of 75%, while another
two acre lot is approved with a maximum impervious coverage
of 55%, resulting in an average impervious coverage of 65%.
B. Height. A maximum height of 60 feet or six stories, whichever is more
restrictive, shall apply if a BC District includes more than 10 contiguous
acres. If a BC District includes less than 10 contiguous acres, then a
maximum height of 40 feet or three stories, whichever is more
restrictive, shall apply. Also, a maximum height of 40 feet or three
stories, whichever is more restrictive, shall apply for any portion of a
building that is within 100 feet from the lot line of an existing
residential use.
(1) Customary extensions of a building that are not occupied by
persons may exceed this height limit, such as elevator equipment,
skylights, water towers, chimneys, smokestacks, parapet walls
used to screen mechanical equipment, and similar features.
C. Landscaping and screening.
(1) See §§ 203-803 and 203-804.
(2) Planting strips shall be provided adjacent to each public street. The
planting strip shall have a minimum width of 30 feet adjacent to the
curbline of an arterial street and 15 feet adjacent to the curbline to
§ 203-316 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-317
1:670
any other street. If curbing is not provided, then such width shall
be measured from the street right-of-way line. A sidewalk of
approved width and approximately perpendicular driveways of
approved width may be placed within this planting strip. The
planting strip shall be maintained in deciduous shade trees, shrubs
and an attractive vegetative ground cover.
(3) As part of land development review for each new principal building,
a landscaping plan shall be submitted to the Township. A minimum
of 20% of each lot shall be landscaped, which shall include grass or
other vegetative ground cover and an appropriate distribution of
trees and shrubs.
D. Utilities. All new electric and telephone service lines within the
development shall be placed underground.
E. Pedestrian access and amenities.
(1) See the provisions of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance regarding sidewalks along streets. An applicant may
apply for a modification under such ordinance to allow a
bituminous asphalt bicycle/walking trail in place of concrete
sidewalks.
(2) Consideration should be given to providing pedestrian routes (such
as crushed stone paths in areas that are not along a public street)
and outdoor lunch areas with picnic tables and trees within a
subdivision for the use of employees of businesses within the
subdivision.
F. Additional BC provisions.
(1) Facade materials. It is strongly encouraged that a minimum of 75%
of the facades of buildings facing onto streets consist of glass, brick
or other decorative masonry. This provision is intended to avoid
metal or cinder block construction, at least as visible from a street.
Subdividers are strongly encouraged to place such a requirement
on each lot through deed restrictions.
(2) Landscaped front yards. Parking in the front yard should primarily
be used for visitor parking and handicapped parking. Other vehicle
parking should primarily be placed to the side or rear of buildings.
(3) Loading docks. An applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the
Township that loading docks have been located within reason to
seek to minimize their visibility from dwellings, public streets and
expressways. No loading dock routinely served by tractor-trailer
trucks shall be located within 75 feet of the existing right-of-way of
a public street.
(4) Access. The Board of Supervisors may require that vehicle access
be provided using an alternative other than direct access from lots
§ 203-317 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-317
1:671
§ 203-318. Additional requirements in the V Village District.
onto Linglestown Road or another arterial street. These
alternatives may include, but are not limited to, access onto a
street that is perpendicular to Linglestown Road, access by
multiple lots onto a new interior street, use of a cross-easement
from an adjacent nonresidential lot, or another method that is
not in conflict with minimum sight distance requirements of the
state. The Board of Supervisors may require that a new lot, use
or land development include a cross-easement and an appropriate
driveway design or a stub right-of-way to allow adjacent lots to
access an arterial street at an appropriate and coordinated access
point.
A. Purposes. The V District is intended to serve the following purposes, in
addition to purposes described in the Comprehensive Plan and the
overall objectives of this chapter:
(1) To promote traditional neighborhood development in village areas,
particularly to protect significant historic resources in accordance
with the traditional neighborhood development provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, which purposes are
hereby included by reference;
(2) To create traditional neighborhood development that regulates new
development and infill development where existing uses and
structures may be incorporated into existing development;
(3) To promote the historic integrity of village areas;
(4) To develop and redevelop in a manner generally consistent with
historic development patterns and existing character of village
areas;
(5) To uphold the design principles of traditional neighborhood
development;
(6) To promote the use, reuse, and renovation of existing structures;
(7) To preserve the look and feel of existing village characteristics,
which may include a centrally located village square, greenspaces,
commercial enterprises, public buildings, residences, and facilities
for social activity, recreation and community functions;
(8) To encourage a livable neighborhood with a fully integrated, mixed
use, pedestrian-oriented community;
(9) To provide for adequate and safe circulation patterns for
pedestrians, bicyclists, motor vehicle traffic, and other modes of
transportation through village areas;
§ 203-317 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-318
1:672
(10) To foster a sense of place and community by providing a setting
that encourages the natural intermingling of everyday uses and
activities within a recognizable community;
(11) To support and enhance the economic viability of village areas;
(12) To encourage off-street community parking areas located on small
vacant lots and parcels adjacent to alleys, based upon site and land
development plan approvals;
(13) To protect natural, historic, and cultural resources of village areas
through regulation of the use of land;
(14) To encourage a variety of architectural features and building
materials to give each building or group of buildings a distinct
character; and
(15) To develop compactly in ways that are designed for the human
scale, including sensitivity to walking distances, the height of
buildings, the design of streetlights and signs, sidewalks, and other
features that preserve the look and feel of village areas as seen
from public view.
B. Dimensional standards.
(1) Lot area: 6,000 square feet minimum.
(2) Lot access: Each lot shall front on a public street, not including an
alley. The Township may establish minimum cartway and pavement
standards for abutting segments of an alley.
(3) Minimum lot width: 50 feet measured at front lot line. The
minimum lot width shall be 45 feet per dwelling unit for a singlefamily
semidetached dwelling.
(4) Minimum lot depth: 120 feet measured at the side lot line.
(5) Setbacks: The following minimum setbacks shall apply:
(a) Front yard setback: 15 feet, 10 feet of which may be occupied
by an unenclosed front porch, which may be covered by a roof.
Where the majority of principal buildings on a block along a
public street have a certain predominant front yard setback,
then any new principal building shall be constructed with a
setback that is not more than 10 feet greater than such
predominant front yard setback.
(b) Rear yard setback: 30 feet, except five feet from an alley for a
storage building or vehicle garage that is accessory to a
dwelling.
(c) Side yard setback: five feet, except 10 feet for a new principal

result in the maximum number of permitted dwelling units
within the development. See bonuses in Subsection F(21)
below.
Note: This method of calculating density does not require
the deletion of stormwater detention basins, shared parking
areas, new streets, new preserved/common open space, new
alleys or similar features. Therefore, the actual density that
could be achieved on a "net" piece of land would be higher
than the above numbers.
(e) Each three beds in a nursing home or personal care center
shall be counted the same as one dwelling unit for the purposes
of controlling density.
(21) Density bonuses:
(a) As an option to the applicant, the applicant may apply for
conditional use approval from the Board of Supervisors to
approve the following increases in the maximum density
provided in Subsection F(20) above. In such case, only the
increase in density shall need conditional use approval.
[1] If the applicant proves that the architectural standards
required by § 203-314D(13) of the traditional
neighborhood development are met or exceeded, the
density may be increased by a maximum of 0.5 additional
dwelling unit per acre.
[2] The maximum density may be increased by a maximum of
0.5 additional dwelling unit per acre if the applicant
commits to provide a minimum of 30% of the total tract
area in common open space.
[3] The maximum density may be increased by a maximum of
0.5 additional dwelling unit per acre if the applicant
commits to construct substantial recreation improvements
and landscaping beyond the amounts of landscaping and
§ 203-319 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-319
1:688
improvements that would otherwise be required. The
market value of the additional recreational improvements
and landscaping shall exceed a minimum of $15,000 per
each additional dwelling unit that is allowed.
[4] The maximum density may also be increased through use
of the age-restricted housing bonus provided in § 203-315.
(22) Required open space and recreation land.
(a) For RRDs, open space and recreation land shall be provided in
the amount of 3,150 square feet (0.0723 acres) per dwelling
unit. To the extent feasible, such open space and recreation
land shall consist of one contiguous area. A minimum of 50% of
such land shall be suitable for active recreation.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance or this Zoning Ordinance to the
contrary, the required open space and recreation land shall
satisfy all of the open space and recreation requirements of
such ordinances.
(c) The open space and recreation land shall be permanently
preserved for open space and recreational use through deed
restrictions or other appropriate restriction of record.
(23) Vehicular and Pedestrian Connectivity.
(a) The existing street system shall be extended into a new RRD to
the extent feasible. Streets, other than cul-de-sac streets, and
sidewalks or trails shall be interconnected throughout the
RRD. The RRD shall have a focal point, such as a commons,
park, or commercial area that is interconnected with the
residential areas of the RRD via streets and sidewalks or other
Township-approved pedestrian pathways.
(b) Sidewalks or other Township-approved pedestrian pathways
shall be provided along both sides of each street, excluding
arterial streets, unless a modification or waiver is granted in
writing by the Board of Supervisors under the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance. The width of sidewalks shall be
a minimum of five feet.
(c) Pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided in the commercial
area using materials and colors that visually distinguish the
crosswalk from the street surface.
(24) Arterial streetscape buffer yard.
(a) A minimum 35 feet wide streetscape buffer yard with screen
plantings shall be required along arterial streets.
§ 203-319 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-319
1:689
(b) The arterial streetscape buffer yard shall comply with buffer
and landscaping standards of §§ 203-803 and 203-804 of this
chapter, and be maintained in deciduous shade trees, shrubs
and an attractive vegetative ground cover.
(25) Architectural design objectives. The developer shall establish
legally enforceable provisions controlling the guidelines of
architectural design of nonresidential buildings and shall adhere to
the following objectives:
(a) Building facades.
[1] Use of preferred materials is required on the sides of any
building that: contains the building's main entrance, and is
oriented toward any street that adjoins the lot on which
such building is located. Preferred materials include brick,
stone, cast stone, precast, stucco, dryvit, textured splitfaced
block, fiber cement siding, wood siding and
materials of similar quality; provided, however, no
preferred materials shall include metal siding or
nontextured split-faced block.
[2] The wall of a building containing the main entrance shall
be architecturally emphasized through fenestration,
entrance treatment, columns, colonnades, pilasters, piers,
recesses, projections, bays, offsets, or other architectural
details.
[3] In order to scale down the horizontality of a building
having a gross floor area exceeding 20,000 square feet,
any pilasters, piers or columns that are used shall be
regularly spaced at intervals of no less than 20 feet on
center and no more than 40 feet on center.
[4] Any portico, colonnade, porch or other building projection
that is supported by the above mentioned pilasters, piers
or columns shall extend at least eight feet from the
building.
[5] The wall of a building that is oriented toward a street
adjoining the lot on which such building is located shall be
architecturally emphasized through fenestration, entrance
treatment, columns, colonnades, pilasters, piers, recesses,
projections, bays, offsets or other architectural details that
breaks up the wall so as not to provide the appearance of a
blank wall. The materials and colors of such side, and the
base of the building, shall be consistent with the materials
and colors of the wall of the building that contains the
main entrance.
(b) Roofs.
§ 203-319 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-319
1:690
[1] Use of preferred materials also is required on all pitched
roofs. Preferred materials include slate shingles, standing
seam metal roofs, architectural grade fiberglass shingles
and materials of similar quality.
[2] Flat roofs shall be provided with a thirty-inch or taller
parapet along any edge of a building facing a street rightof-
way, Township-approved public pedestrian pathway,
residential zoning district or occupied residential dwelling
that adjoins the lot on which such building is located.
[3] For any buildings occupied by more than one principal use,
roof line offsets of a minimum of two feet shall be provided
in order to provide architectural interest and variety to the
massing of a building and relieve the effect of a single roof
line.
G. Combination of Age-Restricted and Non-Age-Restricted Development
Areas.
(1) Within the IN District, two adjacent residential development areas
may be submitted for approval of their zoning densities in one
subdivision and/or land development plan application, provided the
two adjacent development areas are in common ownership at the
time of such zoning density determination by the Township and a
concept plan is submitted to the Township showing how the street
access and open space of the two development areas will be
coordinated. Such development areas may subsequently be
developed by independent entities, provided there is compliance
with the overall density determination under this Section and any
conditions placed upon such determination by the Township.
(2) One of the two development areas shall meet all of the
requirements of this § 203-319. The second development area shall
meet the requirements of this § 203-319, except that the second
development area shall not be required to meet the requirements
of § 203-319F(2) and (3) above. If approved under this § 203-319G
then the maximum density of the two adjacent development areas
may be calculated as an average for the two development areas as
if they were a single development area. At that time, a maximum
density shall be assigned to each of the two development areas,
provided the requirements of this chapter are met.
(3) This § 203-319G shall only be allowed to be used if: a minimum of
60% of the total single-family detached, twin, and townhouse
dwelling units in the two development areas together would qualify
under the requirements of § 203-319F(2) above; and a minimum of
50% of the total single-family detached, twin, and townhouse
dwelling units would meet the age restriction requirements of
§ 203-319F(3), including a restriction on occupancy by at least one
person age 55 or older. In such case, the maximum average density
§ 203-319 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-319
1:691
§ 203-320. R-C Residential Cluster District.
of the two development areas, when calculated together, shall not
exceed five dwelling units per acre.
(a) An applicant may choose a second option of having: a minimum
of 70% of the total single-family detached, twin, and townhouse
dwelling units in the two development areas together meeting
the requirements of § 203-319f(2) above; and a minimum of
50% of the total single-family detached, twin, and townhouse
dwelling units meeting the age restriction requirements of
§ 203-319f(3), including a restriction on occupancy by at least
one person age 55 or older. In such case, the maximum average
density of the two development areas, when calculated
together, shall not exceed six dwelling units per acre.
(4) For dwellings that are not age-restricted or qualify under
§ 203-319f(2) above, the parking requirements of § 203-601 shall
apply instead of the parking standards for § 203-319.
A. Purposes.
(1) To allow the developer more choices of housing types, and enable
development of lots smaller than those specified in other
residential zoning districts, provided the land saved is reserved for
permanent common use, usually in the form of open space.
(2) To permit a procedure for development which shall:
(a) Improve living and working environments;
(b) Promote more economic subdivision layout;
(c) Encourage a variety of types of residential dwellings;
(d) Encourage ingenuity and originality in total subdivision and
individual site design; and
(e) Preserve open space to serve recreational, scenic and public
service purposes.
(3) In the R-C District, the maximum gross density of the zoning
district it replaced shall not be exceeded.
(4) This district is intended to recognize land areas that were
specifically rezoned by the Township in the past for residentialcluster
development, in order to maintain a certain amount of
consistency in regulations applying to ongoing developments. This
district is not intended to be applied to land areas where the R-C
District was not previously established. Instead, the intent is to
promote use of the open space development provisions in other
areas of land.
§ 203-319 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-320
1:692
B. Submission requirements. In addition to submission requirements
under the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, the following
shall be submitted with development plans for an R-C development:
(1) Landscaping plans showing open spaces, planting, existing and
proposed trees and recreational area and facilities.
(2) Existing streets, showing access to the project, proposed roads and
parking layout with dimensions.
(3) Written information regarding land use designations, surrounding
land uses, project design team, development schedule, type, size,
number and estimated selling price of units and density
calculations.
(4) Written information regarding the following:
(a) The nature and extent of the common open space in the
project, the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the
common open space, and the adequacy of the amount and
function of the open space in terms of the densities and
dwelling types proposed in the plan;
(b) The manner in which such plan does make adequate provision
for public services, provide adequate control over vehicular
traffic and further the amenities of light and air, recreation and
visual enjoyment; and
(c) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed
development upon the physical environment and the
neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established.
C. Criteria for approval. A cluster development shall only be approved if
the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors,
based upon review by the Planning Commission, that the following
conditions will be met:
(1) That the cluster development would clearly serve a valid public
purpose that would result in a development that would be superior
to what would result if the land would be developed as a
conventional development. Such valid public purposes include but
are not limited to the following:
(a) The permanent preservation of dense forests, steep slopes,
wetlands, creek valleys, highly scenic areas or other sensitive
natural features.
(b) The permanent preservation of a substantial area of land in
agricultural uses, in a tract of proper size and configuration
that allows for efficient agricultural use and that properly
considers the issue of compatibility between the agricultural
uses and homes. In such case, new dwellings shall be clustered
adjacent to existing dwellings and residential zoning districts.
§ 203-320 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-320
1:693
(c) The dedication of recreation land at a site deemed appropriate
by the Board of Supervisors and that involves land that is
clearly suitable for active and/or passive recreation.
(d) The provision of common open space in a location that will
allow homes to be buffered from highly noxious nuisancegenerating
uses, such as a heavily traveled street or industrial
uses. In such case, intensive landscaping and/or planting for
eventual reforestation should be provided.
(2) That the proposed cluster development has been designed in full
consideration of important natural features, including mature
woodlands, creek valleys, steep slopes and wetlands.
(a) At a minimum, that areas along perennial creeks shall be
preserved in their natural state, except for planting of trees
and shrubs, erosion control improvements, public recreation
improvements and needed utility, street and driveway
crossings. Low-maintenance landscaping is encouraged along
creeks and other areas where maintenance would otherwise be
difficult. See § 203-312.
(b) The natural features of the site shall be a major factor in
determining the siting of dwelling units and streets.
(3) The proposed cluster development shall not have substantial or
undue adverse effects, as compared to a standard development
permitted by the existing zone, upon adjacent property, the
character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, utility
facilities and other matters affecting the public health, safety and
general welfare.
(4) The proposed cluster development shall be constructed, arranged
and operated so as not to interfere with the development and use of
neighboring property.
(5) The proposed cluster development shall be served adequately by
streets.
(6) The proposed cluster development shall not result in the
destruction, loss or damage of any natural, scenic or historic
feature of significant importance.
D. Allowed uses. § 203-306 shall apply.
E. Qualifications for a residential-cluster development.
(1) Tract size. Minimum developable tract size shall be 10 contiguous
acres for development where the replaced zoning district was R-1
or R-2, and 20 contiguous acres for development where the
replaced zoning district was A-1 or P-1. Excluded from the
determination of developable tract size are the following:
§ 203-320 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-320
1:694
(a) One-half of all land situated in the 100-year floodplain.
(b) One-half of all land situated in slopes of over 15%.
(2) Density. The maximum number of dwelling units on the tract shall
be determined based upon an existing features map and a yield
plan.
(a) An existing features map shall be required to be submitted as
part of the application for a cluster development. This existing
features map shall accurately show the locations of the
following at a minimum: wetlands, 100-year floodplains, areas
of woodland, existing topography, existing buildings with a
description of any buildings over 70 years old, highlighting of
15 to 25% slopes and 25% and greater slopes, and any major
scenic views from within the tract or from outside of the tract.
(b) A yield plan shall be submitted to the Township by the
applicant. The yield plan shall accurately show the maximum
number of dwelling units that would be possible under
Township ordinances in effect as of June 1, 2005, under the
regulations of the zoning district that applied immediately
prior to the rezoning to the R-C District. The yield plan shall be
completed to an accurate scale, including accurately showing
the existing features map information described above. The
yield plan shall show potential lots, streets and retention/
detention pond locations. However, the yield plan shall not
serve as, and is not required to contain, the engineering detail
requirements of a preliminary subdivision plan.
(c) Such yield plan shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer, with
advice by the Township Engineer, to determine whether each
represents a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of
dwelling units that were possible on the site, both physically
and legally. If such estimates are determined to not be
accurate, the applicant shall be required by the Zoning Officer
to revise such yield plan until it is accurate.
(d) Density. The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on the
tract through cluster development shall be equal to the
number of dwelling units that is determined by the Township to
have been possible under the Township-accepted yield plan.
However, for land that was formerly in the A-1 District prior to
rezoning to the R-C District, the yield plan may be based upon
one-acre minimum lots.
(3) Mix of dwelling units.
(a) Where the replaced zone was either a R-1 or P-1 District, a
minimum of 45% of the total number of units shall be singlefamily
detached dwellings.
§ 203-320 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-320
1:695
(b) Where the replaced zone was a R-2 District, a minimum of 25%
of the total number of dwelling units shall be single-family
detached dwellings.
(c) Where the replaced zone was an A-1 District, all proposed units
shall be single-family detached. However, if a tract includes
more than 100 acres, then a minimum of 45% of the dwelling
units shall be single-family detached, provided that no housing
type other than single-family detached houses shall be
constructed within 150 feet from a lot of a single-family
detached dwelling that existed prior to the adoption of this
chapter.
(4) Permitted lot reductions. [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No.
07-01]
(a) For a cluster development in any zoning district, both public
sewage service and central water service shall be provided.
(b) For a cluster development in any zoning district, the minimum
yard requirements of the R-2 District shall apply, unless
otherwise specified.
(c) For a cluster development where the replaced district was the
AR or CO District, the minimum lot area shall be reduced to
20,000 square feet and the minimum lot width shall be reduced
to 90 feet, with minimum yard requirements meeting the R-1
District. However, if a tract includes more than 100 acres and
the dwellings will be served by public sewer and water, then
the minimum lot area may be reduced to 7,500 square feet for
single-family detached dwellings with a minimum lot width of
60 feet.
(d) For a cluster development where the replaced zone was NOT
the AR or CO District, for single-family detached dwellings, a
reduction in minimum lot area to 10,000 square feet shall be
allowed with a minimum lot width of 75 feet. If a cluster
development includes a tract of more than 100 total acres, then
such minimum lot area may be reduced to 7,500 square feet
with a minimum lot width of 60 feet. For all other types of
allowed housing, up to 20% reduction is allowed from the
minimum amount of land area required per dwelling unit.
(e) No specific minimum lot area shall apply for townhouses,
provided the overall density requirement is met for the tract.
Individual dwellings may be held in a condominium
arrangement.
(5) Yard dimensions. Yard dimensions shall be as recommended by the
Planning Commission and approved by the Board of Supervisors as
part of the preliminary plan approval, except that each lot in a
cluster development which abuts property in a residential district
§ 203-320 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-320
1:696
shall have a side or rear yard of not less than the required side or
rear yard of the abutting district, and that the yard setback for all
lots fronting on public streets shall not be less than the front yard
setback requirements of the respective zoning districts in which
they were formerly located.
(6) Buffer areas. Buffer areas shall be required along exterior property
lines where units in a proposed cluster development abut
noncluster residential development. Buffers shall consist primarily
of six feet or higher evergreen trees spaced 10 feet apart in
staggered double rows. Additional plant materials and earthen
mounding are encouraged to soften the linear appearance of the
rows of evergreen trees. Where buffers are required, a planting
plan shall be required which shows the location, size, species and
number of plant materials to be used.
F. Housing.
(1) In addition to the other allowed housing types, the following
housing types may be constructed as part of a cluster development:
(a) Atrium house. The atrium house is a single-family attached
dwelling unit with individual outside access. The lot shall be
fully enclosed by a wall at least seven feet high. A private yard,
herein called an "atrium," shall be included on each lot. All
living spaces, such as living rooms, dens and bedrooms, shall
open onto the atrium.
[1] Lot area and width:
Bedrooms

5 2,500 40
[2] Minimum atrium dimension: 16 feet.
[3] Minimum atrium area: 288 square feet.
(b) Lot line house. A lot line house is a single-family detached
residence on an individual lot, with the building set on one of
the side property lines. An easement for maintenance on the
adjoining lot is required.
[1] Lot area minimum: 7,000 square feet.
§ 203-320 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-320
1:697
[2] Minimum yard:
[a] Front: 25 feet.
[b] Rear: 30 feet.
[3] Minimum lot width at building setback line: 60 feet.
[4] Minimum principal building spacing: 30 feet.
(2) Not more than eight townhouses shall be attached in a single
group, and no more than two contiguous townhouses in any group
may be constructed in line.
(3) Spacing of buildings. Minimum distances between principal
buildings shall be as follows:
(a) Single-family detached: 30 feet in former A-1 or P-1 zoned
areas; 20 feet in former R-1 or R-2 zoned areas.
(b) Twin dwelling: 30 feet between buildings in all areas.
(c) Apartments: 40 feet between buildings in all areas.
(d) Townhouse: 40 feet between buildings in all areas.
(e) Atrium house: 30 feet between buildings in all areas.
(f) Lot line house: 30 feet in former A-1 or P-1 zoned areas, 20 feet
in former R-1 or R-2 zoned areas.
G. Garages and accessory buildings. Garages and accessory buildings may
be located in any rear yard, provided that they do not violate the
coverage regulation herein set forth and that side yards of not less than
two feet are provided, and that a rear yard setback from the rear
property line of not less than three feet is provided.
H. Impervious coverage regulations. The maximum permitted impervious
coverage shall be 30% and shall apply to the developable tract area
total, rather than to individual lots.
I. Height regulations. Single-family residences shall not exceed 35 feet in
height, and other permitted uses shall not exceed 40 feet in height.
J. Utilities. Both public water and public sewage shall be provided in any
cluster development.
K. Open space requirements.
(1) Open space areas shall be developed to complement and enhance
the manmade environment. In the selection of the location of such
areas, consideration shall be given to the preservation of natural
and manmade features which will enhance the attractiveness and
value of the remainder of the property to be subdivided or
developed, such as floodplains, including streams and ponds,
§ 203-320 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-320
1:698
slopes equal to or greater than 15%, natural permanent vegetation,
historical amenities and other community assets.
(a) A minimum of 40% of the total tract area shall be permanently
preserved as "common open space," with a method of
ownership and maintenance that is acceptable to the Board of
Supervisors, after review by the Township Planning
Commission. A minimum of 50% of the required common open
space shall be in one contiguous tract, which may be separated
only by creeks or by a maximum of one street. Common open
space may also be traversed by an accessway limited to
emergency vehicles.
(2) The area shall be so located and designed that it is easily accessible
to all people including the handicapped. Safe and easy access to
common open space areas shall be provided either by adjoining
road frontage, easements or paths.
(3) Whenever possible, common open space areas shall be designed as
a continuous system of usable areas, which are interspersed among
groupings of residential buildings, provided, however, in those
instances in which the total minimum required open space is less
than two acres in size, such acres shall be located in one parcel;
and shall only be broken up if the development site or its physical
constraints dictate otherwise with the concurrence of the Planning
Commission and Board of Supervisors.
(4) Such areas specifically designed for open space shall be fully
usable and suitable for that purpose and shall be set aside by deed
restriction.
(5) Accessways to the site shall be sufficiently wide so that
maintenance equipment shall have reasonable convenient access to
such areas. In all instances, such open space areas shall be
maintained in a careful and prudent manner.
(6) Common open space may be dedicated partially or entirely to
public use. The Township Parks and Recreation Commission may
recommend and the Board of Supervisors may approve the
dedication of any common open space land for public use. However,
the Board of Supervisors shall also have the right to not accept any
dedication of open space if it finds that the size, location, type of
development or cost of development or maintenance of such
common open space or the availability of other public open space
nearby would make public use undesirable or unnecessary.
(7) Private ownership. When common open space is not dedicated and
accepted to public use, it shall be protected by legal arrangements,
satisfactory to the Township, sufficient to assure its maintenance
and preservation for whatever purpose it is intended. Covenants or
other legal arrangements shall:
§ 203-320 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-320
1:699
(a) Obligate purchasers to participate in a homeowners
association and to support maintenance of the open areas by
paying to the association assessments sufficient for such
maintenance and subjecting their properties to a lien for
enforcement of payment of the respective assessments.
(b) Obligate such an association to maintain the open areas and
private streets and utilities.
(c) Empower the Township to enforce the covenants in the event of
failure of compliance. [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No.
07-01]
(d) Provide for agreement that, if the Township is required to
perform any maintenance work pursuant to the item above,
such purchasers would pay the cost thereof and that the same
shall be a lien upon their properties until such cost has been
paid; provided that the developer shall be responsible for the
formation of the homeowners' association of which the
developer, or if the developer is not the owner of the
development, then such owner, shall be a member until all of
the lots of record are sold. Other equivalent provisions to
assure adequate perpetual maintenance may be permitted if
approved by the Board of Supervisors. Assurance that such
covenants or equivalent provisions will be included in the
deeds or other instruments of conveyance shall be evidenced
by the recordation in the office of Recorder of Deeds, of a
perpetual maintenance of facilities as prescribed herein above
and identifying the tract and each lot therein. The declaration
shall be included in the deed or other instrument of
conveyance of each lot of record and shall be made binding on
all purchasers, provided that such declaration may, as to
subsequent conveyances other than the initial conveyance of
each lot of record, be incorporated by reference in the
instrument of conveyance.
(e) Guarantee that any association formed to own and maintain
common open space will not be dissolved without the consent
of the Board of Supervisors and any other specifications
deemed necessary by the Board of Supervisors.
(f) Such covenants or equivalent legal arrangements shall be
submitted for preliminary review with the preliminary plan and
shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of Supervisors
prior to the granting of final plan approval.
(8) The common open space shall be limited to uses or a range of uses
approved by the Board of Supervisors at the time of subdivision,
land development and/or conditional use approval. Any future
change to the allowed uses in the common open space shall require
conditional use approval.
§ 203-320 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-320
1:700
(9) The Board of Supervisors may require that the majority of the
required common open space be placed:
(a) Adjacent to an existing or planned public or homeowner
association-owned recreation area,
(b) Adjacent to existing farmland,
(c) At the edge of a neighboring undeveloped lot, where the
common open space could be connected in the future to open
space on that neighboring lot, or
(d) Adjacent to an arterial street where the open space will serve
to buffer homes from the street.

ARTICLE IV
Additional Requirements for Specific Uses
§ 203-401. Applicability.
§ 203-402. Additional requirements for specific principal uses.
A. This article establishes additional specific requirements for certain
specific uses, in addition to the sign, parking, environmental and other
general requirements of this chapter and the requirements of each
district. Wherever two requirements conflict, the stricter requirement
shall apply.
(1) For uses allowed within a specific zoning district as "special
exception" uses, see also the procedures and standards in
§ 203-116. For conditional uses, see also § 203-117.
A. Each of the following uses shall meet all of the following requirements
for that use:
(1) Adult Use. (This is limited to the following: adult bookstore, adult
movie theater, massage parlor, or adult live entertainment facility)
(a) Purposes. The regulations on adult uses are intended to serve
the following purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of
this chapter.
[1] To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses
that affect health, safety and general welfare concerns of
the Township. These secondary impacts have been
documented in research conducted across the nation.
These secondary impacts typically include, but are not
limited to: increases in criminal activity, increases in
activities that increase the risk of transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases, increases in activities that increase
the risk of transmission of other communicable diseases,
increases in blight, decreases in the stability of residential
neighborhoods, and decreases in property values for
surrounding homes, and decreases in the marketability of
nearby commercial business space. The research
conducted across the nation concludes that adult uses
typically involve insufficient self-regulation to control
these secondary effects.
[2] To limit adult uses to locations where these secondary
impacts can be minimized, particularly as they affect
residential neighborhoods and commercial revitalization.
[3] To not attempt to suppress any activities protected by the
"free speech" protections of the State and United States
Constitutions, but instead to control secondary effects.
§ 203-401 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-402
1:703
(b) An adult use and its parking area shall not be located within
any of the following distances, whichever is most restrictive:
[1] Five hundred linear feet from the lot line of an existing
dwelling,

residential zoning district.
[3] One thousand linear feet from the lot line of any primary or
secondary school, place of worship, library, public park,
day care center or child nursery.
(c) No adult use shall be located within 1,000 lineal feet from any
existing "adult use."
(d) A fifty-foot buffer yard shall be provided, regardless of zoning
district, along the side and rear lot lines. If such buffer area
does not include substantial mature trees that will be
preserved, it shall include continuous screening by evergreen
trees with an initial height of five feet.
(e) No pornographic material, displays or words shall be placed in
view of persons who are not inside of the establishment.
Definite precautions shall be made to prohibit minors from
entering the premises.
(f) No adult use shall be used for any purpose that violates any
federal, state or municipal law.
(g) Pornographic and sexually explicit signs and displays shall be
prohibited that are visible from outside of the premises.
(h) The adult use shall not include the sale or display of "obscene"
materials, as defined by Pennsylvania criminal law, as may be
amended by applicable court decisions.
[1] An adult use shall be prohibited in all districts except
where specifically allowed under § 203-306. An adult use is
a distinct use and shall not be allowed under any other use,
such as a retail store or club.
(i) A minimum lot area of one acre is required.
(j) For public health reasons, private or semiprivate viewing
booths of any kind are prohibited. This specifically includes,
but is not limited to, booths for viewing adult movies or nude
dancers.
(k) No use may include live actual or simulated sex acts nor any
physical or sexual contact between employees and entertainers
nor or between employees or entertainers and customers. At
an adult live entertainment use, employees or entertainers
§ 203-402 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-402
1:704
shall maintain a minimum distance of three feet from
customers. This shall include, but not be limited to, a
prohibition on "lap dancing."
(l) Only "lawful" massages as defined by state court decisions
shall be performed in a massage parlor.
(m) All persons within any adult use shall wear non-transparent
garments that cover their genitals and the female areola,
except within a permitted lawful "adult live entertainment
facility."
(n) Any application for such use shall state the names and home
addresses of: all individuals intended to have more than a 5%
ownership in such use or in a corporation owning such use; and
an on-site manager responsible to ensure compliance with this
chapter on a daily basis. A telephone number shall be provided
where the on-site manager can be reached during Township
business hours. Such information shall be updated at the
beginning of each year in writing to the Zoning Officer.
(o) The use shall not operate between the hours of 12:00 midnight
and 7:00 a.m.
(p) As specific conditions of approval under this chapter, the
applicant shall prove compliance, where applicable, with the
following state laws, as amended: the Pennsylvania Liquor
Code, Act 219 of 1990 (which pertains to sale or consumption
of alcohol between 2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.), Act 207 of 1990
(which pertains to obscenity) and Act 120 of 1996 (which
pertains to adult-oriented establishments and which limits
enclosed viewing booths among other matters).

219 of 1990, as amended (Section 7327 of Title 18 of the
Pennsylvania Statutes). In the event that the use would be
determined to be allowed, a 500 feet setback shall apply from the
building and any parking areas from any residential zoning district.
The applicant shall prove that adequate on-site security will be in
place.

or accessory use.
§ 203-402 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-402
1:711
(a) An accessory commercial communications antenna shall be
permitted by right in any district if it meets the following
requirements:
[1] In a district other than a commercial or industrial district,
the antenna shall extend a maximum of 20 feet beyond the
existing structure to which it is attached. The antenna
shall be attached to one of the following existing lawful
structures:
[a] A principal agricultural building or silo;
[b] An electric high-voltage transmission tower;
[c] An existing lawful commercial communications tower;
[d] A fire station or steeple or bell tower of a place of
worship; or
[e] A water tower.
[2] In a commercial or industrial district, the antennas shall
extend a maximum of 40 feet beyond an existing building
or structure (other than a dwelling), provided the antenna
is setback a distance equal to its total height above the
ground from any lot line of a dwelling on another lot.
(b) Any commercial communications antenna/tower that does not
meet Subsection A(16)(a) above (such as a new freestanding
tower) shall only be allowed where specifically authorized in
§ 203-306, and in compliance with the following additional
regulations:
[1] Such antenna/tower shall be set back from all lot lines and
street rights-of-way a distance that is greater than the
total height of the antenna/tower above the surrounding
ground level. The Board of Supervisors may permit an
easement arrangement to be used without meeting the
setback requirement from the edge of the leased area,
provided that there are legal safeguards to ensure that the
setback will continue to be met over time from a lot line.
[2] A new tower, other than a tower on a lot of an emergency
services station, shall be set back the following minimum
distance from any existing dwelling: 300 feet plus the total
height of the tower above the surrounding ground level.
[3] A tower attached to the ground shall be surrounded by a
security fence/gate with a minimum height of eight feet
and evergreen plantings or preserved vegetation with an
initial minimum height of four feet.
§ 203-402 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-402
1:712
[4] The applicant shall provide a written statement sealed by a
professional engineer stating that the communications
antenna/tower will meet the structural and wind
resistence requirements of the Construction Code.
[5] The applicant shall describe in writing the policies that will
be used to offer space on a tower to other communications
providers, which shall serve to minimize the total number
of towers necessary in the region. This policy shall be
designed to minimize the total number of towers necessary
in the Township.
[6] An applicant for a new commercial communications tower
shall provide evidence to the Board of Supervisors ("the
Board") that they have investigated co-locating their
facilities on an existing tower and other tall structures and
have found such alternative to be unworkable. The reasons
shall be provided.
[7] A maximum total height of 200 feet above the ground shall
apply in a commercial and industrial district and 150 feet
in any other district where it may be allowed, unless the
applicant proves to the Board of Supervisors as a
conditional use that a taller height is absolutely necessary
and unavoidable.
[8] The application shall describe any proposed lighting. The
Board may require lighting of an antenna even if it will not
be required by the Federal Aviation Administration. Such
lighting is intended to provide protection for emergency
medical helicopters. Strobe lighting shall not be used, but
flashing lights may be used.
[9] A new tower shall be designed in a manner that minimizes
its visual intrusiveness and environmental impacts to the
maximum extent feasible. For example, monopole designs
or designs worked into a flag pole are preferred over
lattice designs. Self-supporting towers are preferred over
towers with guy wires that would require removal of larger
numbers of trees.
(c) Purposes. These provisions for commercial communications
antenna/towers are primarily designed to serve the following
purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of this chapter:
[1] To protect property values.
[2] To minimize the visual impact of antenna/towers,
particularly considering the importance of the scenic
beauty of the area in attracting visitors for outdoor
recreation.
§ 203-402 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-402
1:713
[3] To minimize the number and heights of towers in a manner
that still provides for adequate telecommunications
services and competition.
(d) A tower/antenna that is intended to primarily serve emergency
communications by a Township-recognized police, fire or
ambulance organization, and is on the same lot as an
emergency services station, shall be permitted by right. Such
tower/antenna may also serve commercial purposes.
(e) Any antenna and tower that is no longer in active use shall be
completely removed within six months after the discontinuance
of use. The operator shall notify the Zoning Officer in writing
after the antenna or tower use is no longer in active use. Any
lease shall require such removal by the owner of the antenna/
tower. Any lease should provide that the lease shall expire once
the antenna/tower is removed. The Board of Supervisors may
require that a financial guarantee be posted to pay for removal
of the tower if the Board determines such guarantee is needed.
(f) All accessory utility buildings or cabinets shall: have a
maximum total floor area of 400 square feet, which may be
divided among adjacent buildings serving separate companies,
have a maximum height of 10 feet and meet principal building
setbacks.
(g) No new or existing antenna shall cause interference with
public safety telecommunications. The Township may require
the applicant for a new commercial communications tower to
submit a study by a radio frequency engineer or other qualified
professional to analyze the threat of interference. The study
shall also show that the tower and antenna will not create
interference with other communications systems, such as
amateur ham radio operators.
(17) Conversion of an Existing Building (including an Existing
Dwelling) into Dwelling Units.
(a) See Article III, which regulates where conversions are
permitted. Applicable state fire safety requirements shall be
met.
(b) The following regulations shall apply to the conversion of an
existing one-family dwelling into a greater number of dwelling
units:
[1] The building shall maintain the appearance of a one-family
dwelling with a single front entrance. Additional entrances
may be placed on the side or rear of the structure. The
dwelling units may internally share the single front
entrance.
§ 203-402 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-402
1:714
[2] The conversion shall not be permitted if it would require
the placement of an exterior stairway on the front of the
building, or would require the placement of more than
three off-street parking spaces in the required front yard.
(c) A previously residential building shall maintain a clearly
residential appearance, except as may be necessary for
restoration of an historic building.
(d) A maximum total of four dwelling units may be developed per
lot unless a more restrictive provision is established by another
section of this chapter, unless the building included more than
4,000 square feet of building floor area at the time of adoption
of this chapter.
(e) Each unit shall meet the definition of a dwelling unit and shall
meet the minimum floor area requirements of § 203-801C.

approved if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Board of Supervisors that the area street system is suitable in
terms of structure, geometry, safety and capacity to
accommodate the additional truck traffic.
(c) If the water will be trucked off-site, any area used for loading
or unloading of tractor-trailer trucks shall be set back a

spaces on driveways immediately in front of a carport or
garage entrance, shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from
any dwelling.
(c) Garages. It is strongly recommended that all townhouses be
designed so that garages and/or carports are not an overly
prominent part of the view from public streets. For this reason,
parking courts, common garage or carport structures or
garages at the rear of dwellings are encouraged instead of
individual garages opening onto the front of the building,
especially for narrow townhouse units.
(d) Mailboxes. Any mailboxes provided within the street right-ofway
should be clustered together in an orderly and attractive
arrangement or structure. Individual freestanding mailboxes of
noncoordinated types at the curbside are specifically
discouraged.

rectangular grass field 50 feet by 150 feet that is suitable
for free play by young persons. If all dwellings in a
development will be restricted to at least one resident age
55 and older, then the common open space shall at a
minimum include landscaped trails that are ADAaccessible.
[2] A recreation building or pool available to all residents of
the development may count towards the open space
requirement. Areas with a width of less than 50 feet shall
not count towards this requirement. This requirement
shall be in place of any requirement for recreation land or
fees under the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
(52)Treatment Center.

minimum setbacks for accessory structures.
§ 203-403 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-403
1:741
(b) No fence, wall or hedge shall obstruct the sight distance as
required by § 203-803C. and/or the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance. (Note: The sight distance provisions
typically regulate features over three feet in height.)
(c) Fences.
[1] Front yard. Any fence located in the required minimum
front yard of a lot in a residential district shall:
[a] Be an open-type of fence (such as picket, wroughtiron,
vinyl post, chain link or split-rail) with a
minimum ratio of 1:1 of open to structural areas; and
[b] Not exceed four feet in height. A taller height may be
approved by the Zoning Officer if necessary to contain
animals or to address a specific hazard, such as an
electric transformer.
[2] On a corner lot, a fence or wall shall meet the same
requirements along both streets as would apply within a
minimum front yard. However, a fence that only extends
behind the rear of a dwelling may have a maximum height

the Zoning Officer that such taller height is necessary
to protect public safety around a specific hazard.
[b] A fence in the minimum front yard that is not within a
residential district shall have a maximum height of
four feet.
[4] Setbacks. No fence shall be built within an existing street
right-of-way. A fence may be constructed without a setback
from a lot line, except that a fence shall be located on the
inside of any buffer plantings required by § 203-803 and
except that a five feet minimum setback shall apply for a
fence of a principal business that is more than six feet in
height and that is adjacent to a principal dwelling. Where
no setback is required, a one foot or greater setback is
recommended to provide for future maintenance of the
fence and to account for possible inaccurate lot lines.
§ 203-403 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-403
1:742
[5] Fence materials. Barbed wire shall not be used as part of
fences around dwellings in residential districts.

farm animals and shall be of such low intensity that they
will not permanently injure humans. No fence or wall shall
be constructed out of fabric, junk, junk vehicles,
appliances, drums, or barrels.

eight feet in height, it shall be set back a minimum of 15
feet from a lot line of an existing dwelling.
[2] No wall of greater than three feet shall be located in the
required front yard in a residential district, except as a
backing for a permitted sign as permitted in § 203-704.
[3] A wall in a residential district outside of a required front
yard shall have a maximum height of three feet if it is
within the minimum accessory structure setback.

A. General. Parking spaces and accessways shall be laid out to result in
safe and orderly use and to fully take into account all of the following:
vehicular access onto and off the site, vehicular movement within the
site, loading areas, pedestrian patterns, and any drive-throuth facilities.
No parking area shall cause a safety hazard or impediment to traffic off
the lot.
§ 203-601 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-602
1:765
B. Existing parking.
(1) Any parking spaces serving such preexisting structures or uses at
the time of adoption of this chapter shall not in the future be
reduced in number below the number required by this chapter.
(2) If a new principal nonresidential building is constructed on a lot,
then any existing parking on such lot that serves such building shall
be reconfigured to comply with this chapter, including but not
limited to, requirements for channelization of traffic from adjacent
streets, channelization of traffic within the lot, minimum aisle
widths, paving, and landscaping.
C. Change in use or expansion. A structure or use in existence at the
effective date of this chapter that expands or changes in use of an
existing principal building shall be required to provide all of the
required parking for the entire size and type of the resulting use, except
as follows:
(1) If an existing lawful use includes less parking than would be
required if the use would be newly developed, then that deficit of
parking shall be grandfathered for reuses of an existing building.
For example, an existing store might include three parking spaces
and would have been required to provide seven spaces if it was
newly developed. Therefore, there is an existing nonconforming
deficit of four spaces. Then, if that store is converted to an office
that would need 10 spaces, the office would need to provide a total
of six spaces (10 spaces minus the preexisting deficit of four equals
six). This provision may be used in combination with Subsection
C(2) below, as applicable. [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No.
07-01]
(2) If a nonresidential use expands by an aggregate total maximum of
5% in the applicable measurement (such as building floor area)
beyond what existed at the time of adoption of this chapter, then no
additional parking is required. For example, if an existing building
included 3,000 square feet, and a single minor addition of 150
square feet was proposed, then additional parking would not be
required. This addition without providing new parking shall only be
allowed one time per lot.
D. Continuing obligation of parking and loading spaces. All required
numbers of parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be
available as long as the use or building which the spaces serve still
exist, and such spaces shall not be reduced in number below the
minimum required by this chapter. No required parking area or offstreet
loading spaces shall be used for any other use (such as storage or
display of materials) that interferes with the area's availability for
parking.
E. Location of parking.
§ 203-602 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-602
1:766
(1) Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot or
abutting lot with the principal use served, unless the applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that a
method of providing the spaces is guaranteed to be available
during all of the years the use is in operation within 300 feet
walking distance from the entrance of the principal use being
served. Such distance may be increased to 500 feet for employee
parking of a nonresidential use. A written and signed lease shall be
provided, if applicable.
(a) The Zoning Hearing Board may require that the use be
approved for period of time consistent with the lease of the
parking and that a renewal of the permit shall only be
approved if the parking lease is renewed.
F. Reduction of parking requirements as a special exception.
(1) Purposes: To minimize the amount of land covered by paving, while
making sure adequate parking is provided. To recognize that
unique circumstances may justify a reduction in parking.
(2) As a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may authorize a
reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required to be
provided for a use if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Hearing Board that a lesser number of spaces would be
sufficient.
(a) The applicant shall provide evidence justifying the proposed
reduced number of spaces, such as studies of similar
developments during their peak hours. The applicant shall also
provide relevant data, such as numbers of employers, peak
expected number of customers/visitors and similar data.
(b) Under this section, an applicant may prove that a reduced
number of parking spaces is justified because more than one
principal use will share the same parking. In such case, the
applicant shall prove that the parking has been designed to
encourage shared use, and that long-term agreements ensure
that the parking will continue to be shared. The amount of the
reduction in parking should be determined based upon
whether the different uses have different hours of peak
demand and/or overlapping customers.
[1] In addition, an applicant may prove that parking needs will
be reduced or that off-site parking is feasible because the
applicant agrees to make a long-term commitment to a
shuttle service for residents or employees.
(c) Reserved area for additional parking. Under this section, the
Zoning Hearing Board may require that a portion of the
required parking be met through a reservation of an area for
future parking. The Board may require the reservation for a
§ 203-602 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-602
1:767
§ 203-603. Design standards for off-street parking.
certain number of years or an indefinite period corresponding
to the years the buildings are in use.
[1] Such reservation shall be in a form acceptable to the
Zoning Hearing Board Solicitor that legally binds current
and future owners of the land to keep the reserved parking
area in open space and then to provide the additional
parking if the Township determines it is necessary. A deed
restriction is recommended.
[2] If approved under this Subsection F(2)(c), the applicant
shall present a site plan to the Zoning Officer that shows
the layout that will be used for the additional parking if the
parking is required to be provided in the future. The site
plan shall show that the additional parking is integrated
with the overall traffic access and pedestrian access for
the site and that the additional parking will be able to meet
Township requirements.
[3] The additional parking that is "reserved" under this
subsection shall be required to be kept as landscaped open
area, until such time as the Zoning Hearing Board decision
may authorize the land's release from the restriction, or
until the Township may require that the land be developed
as parking.
[4] The Zoning Officer shall periodically review the sufficiency
of the parking that is provided. If the Zoning Officer in the
future determines that the reserved parking is needed to
meet actual demand, he/she shall provide written notice to
the property owner. The property owner shall then have
one year to develop the reserved area into off-street
parking in compliance with this chapter.
A. General requirements.
(1) Backing onto a street. No parking area shall be designed to require
or encourage parked vehicles to back into a public street in order
to leave a parking space, except for a single-family or two-family,
twin, or townhouse dwelling with its access onto a local street or
parking court. Parking spaces may back onto an alley. [Amended
11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
(2) Every required parking space shall be designed so that each motor
vehicle may proceed to and from the parking space provided for it
without requiring the moving of any other vehicle, unless
specifically permitted otherwise.
(3) Parking areas shall not be within a required buffer yard or street
right-of-way.
§ 203-602 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-603
1:768
(4) Separation from street. Except for parking spaces immediately in
front of individual dwellings, all areas for off-street parking, offstreet
loading and unloading and the storage or movement of motor
vehicles shall be physically separated from the street by a
continuous grass or landscaped planting strip, except for necessary
and approved vehicle entrances and exits to the lot.
(5) Stacking and obstructions. Each lot shall provide adequate area
upon the lot to prevent back-up of vehicles on a public street while
awaiting entry to the lot, or while waiting for service at a drivethrouth
facility.
B. Size and marking of parking spaces.
(1) Each parking space shall be a rectangle with a minimum width of
nine feet and a minimum length of 18 feet, except the minimum
sized rectangle shall be eight feet by 22 feet for parallel parking.
(2) For handicapped spaces, see § 203-603G below.
(3) All spaces shall be marked to indicate their location, except those
of a one- or two-family dwelling.
C. Aisles.
(1) Each aisle providing for one-way traffic to access parking stalls
shall have the following minimum width:
Angle of Parking
Minimum Aisle Width
(feet)
Parallel or 30° 12
45° 14
60° 18
90° 20
(2) Each aisle providing access to stalls for two-way traffic shall be a
minimum of 22 feet in width, except a width of 20 feet may be
allowed for parking areas with spaces that are parallel or involve
an angle of parking of 45° or less.
D. Accessways and driveways.
(1) Width of driveway/accessway at entrance onto a public street, at
the edge of the cartway*
1-Way Use 2-Way Use
Minimum 12* 25*
Maximum 20* 30*
§ 203-603 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-603
1:769
* Unless a different standard is required by PennDOT for an
entrance to a state road, or the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that a wider width is needed
for tractor-trailer trucks.
(2) Drainage. Adequate provisions shall be made to maintain
uninterrupted parallel drainage along a public street at the point of
driveway entry. The Township may require an applicant to install an
appropriate type and size of pipe at a driveway crossing.
E. Paving, grading and drainage.
(1) Parking and loading facilities and including driveways shall be
graded and adequately drained to prevent erosion or excessive
water flow across streets or adjoining properties.
(2) Except for landscaped areas, all portions of required parking,
loading facilities and driveways shall be surfaced with asphalt,
concrete, paving block, or other low-dust materials preapproved by
the Township.
(a) However, by special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may
allow parking areas with low or seasonal usage to be
maintained in stone, grass or other suitable surfaces. For
example, the Board may allow parking spaces to be grass,
while major aisles are covered by stone.
(b) If the design and material are found acceptable by the
Township Engineer, portions of parking areas may be covered
with a low-dust porous parking surface that is designed to
promote groundwater recharge. This might include porous
asphalt or pervious concrete placed over open graded gravel
and crushed stone. Porous parking surfaces shall not be
allowed in areas routinely used by heavy trucks.
F. Lighting of parking areas. See "light and glare control" in Article V.
G. Parking for persons with disabilities. Vehicle parking for persons with
disabilities shall comply with applicable federal and state requirements.
(Note: As of the enactment date of this chapter, such provisions were
published in ANSI Standard A117 and Section 1106 of the International
Building Code.)
(1) Number of spaces. The following number of parking spaces for
persons with disabilities shall be required, unless a different
number of spaces is officially required under a federal or state
requirement:
§ 203-603 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-603
1:770
Total Number of Parking
Spaces on the Lot
Required Minimum Number/
Percent of Parking Spaces for
Persons with Disabilities

501 to 1,000 2% of required number of spaces
1,001 or more 20 plus 1% of required number of
spaces over 1,000
(2) Standards. The sizes, slopes, locations and marking of spaces for
persons with disabilities shall comply with the applicable ANSI
standards. (Note: Such standards typically require each space to be
eight feet by 18 feet, with an adjacent to a five feet wide access
aisle. Such access aisle may be shared by two handicapped spaces
by being placed between them. However, one out of every eight
required handicapped parking spaces shall have an adjacent access
aisle of eight feet width instead of five feet.)
(3) Marking. All required handicapped spaces shall be well-marked by
clearly visible signs and by pavement markings. Such signs and
markings shall be maintained over time. Blue paint is
recommended. On commercial lots, the amount of the fine for
violations shall be noted on signs that are visible to persons parking
in the space.
(4) Paving. Handicapped parking spaces and adjacent areas needed to
access them with a wheelchair shall be covered with a smooth
surface that is usable with a wheelchair.
(5) If a new principal nonresidential building is constructed on a lot,
then any existing parking on such lot that shall be reconfigured to
meet the parking with disabilities requirements.
H. Paved area setbacks (including off-street parking setbacks).
(1) Intent. To ensure that parked or moving vehicles within a lot do not
obstruct sight distance or interfere with pedestrian traffic, to aid in
stormwater management along streets and to prevent vehicles
from entering or exiting a lot other than at approved driveways.
§ 203-603 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-603
1:771
(2) Any new or expanded paved area serving a principal nonresidential
use shall be separated from a public street by a planting strip. The
planting strip shall have a minimum width of 30 feet and be
maintained in grass or other attractive vegetative ground cover. At
least 20 feet of the planting strip shall be outside of the existing
street right-of-way. This 30 feet width shall be increased to 40 feet
for a lot including 100,000 to 200,000 square feet of building floor
area, and to 50 feet for a lot including more than 200,000 square
feet of building floor area.
(a) Within the planting strip, plants shall not be planted with
heights or in locations that would obstruct safe sight distances,
except that deciduous trees may be planted that allow
motorists to view under the leaf canopy.
(b) The planting strip may be placed inward from the shoulder of
an uncurbed street or inward from the curb of a curbed street.
The planting strip may overlap the street right-of-way, provided
it does not conflict with PennDOT requirements, and provided
that the Township and PennDOT as applicable maintain the
right to replace planting areas within the right-of-way with
future street improvements.
(c) Township-approved sidewalks, recreation paths and
approximately perpendicular driveway crossings may be
placed within the planting strip. Mostly vegetative stormwater
channels may be placed within the planting strip.
(d) The following shall be prohibited within the planting strip:
[1] Paving, except as allowed by Subsection H(2)(c) above,
and except for street widenings that may occur after the
development is completed,
[2] Fences and walls, other than necessary retaining walls,
and
[3] Parking, storage or display of vehicles or items for sale or
rent.
(e) Where feasible, where a sidewalk is not installed, this setback
should include an unobstructed generally level width running
parallel to a street that is suitable for a person to walk.
(3) See landscaping requirements in §§ 203-803 and 203-804.
I. Parking setback from buildings. Parking spaces serving principal
nonresidential buildings and apartment buildings shall be located a
minimum of 10 feet from any principal building wall, unless a larger
distance is required by another provision. This distance shall not apply
at vehicle entrances into or under a building.
§ 203-603 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-604
1:772
§ 203-604. Off-street loading.
§ 203-605. Fire lanes.
A. Each use shall provide off-street loading facilities, which meet the
requirements of this section, sufficient to accommodate the maximum
demand generated by the use and the maximum size vehicle, in a
manner that will not routinely obstruct traffic on a public street and
traffic entering and exiting the lot. If no other reasonable alternative is
feasible, traffic may be obstructed for occasional loading and unloading
along an alley, provided traffic has the ability to use another method of
access.
B. At the time of review under this chapter, the applicant shall provide
evidence to the Zoning Officer on whether the use will have sufficient
numbers and sizes of loading facilities. The Planning Commission and/
or Board of Supervisors may provide advice to the Zoning Officer on
this matter as part of any plan review by such boards. For the purposes
of this section, the words "loading" and "unloading" are used
interchangeably.
C. Each space and the needed maneuvering room shall not intrude into
approved buffer areas and landscaped areas.
A. Fire lanes shall be provided and maintained as provided in the
International Fire Protection Code.

ARTICLE VIII
General Regulations
§ 203-801. Frontage onto improved streets; number of uses or
buildings; minimum size of dwellings.
A. Frontage required onto improved street. Each proposed new lot, each
land development and each proposed principal building shall be on a lot
which directly abuts a public street, a street proposed to be dedicated
to the Township by the subdivision plan which created or creates such
lot, or a private street which meets all of the requirements of the
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. In the case of
townhouses, manufactured/mobile home park, or apartments, each unit
may have access onto a parking court which then has access onto a
public or private street meeting Township standards.
B. Number of principal uses and principal buildings per lot.
(1) A lot in a commercial or industrial district may include more than
one permitted principal use per lot and/or more than one permitted
principal building per lot, provided that all of the requirements are
met for each use and each building. If differing dimensional
requirements apply for different uses on the lot, then the most
restrictive requirement shall apply.
(a) For example, if Use 1 requires a one-acre lot area and Use 2 on
the same lot requires a two-acre lot area, then the lot shall
have a minimum lot area of two acres.
(b) The applicant shall submit a site plan that demonstrates that
each structure would meet the requirements of this chapter.
(c) The uses and buildings shall be in common ownership.
However, a condominium form of ownership of individual
buildings, with a legally binding property owners' association,
may be established if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
the Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Township
Solicitor, that there will be appropriate legal mechanisms in
place.
(2) A lot within a residential district shall not include more than one
principal use and shall not include more than one principal building
unless specifically permitted by this chapter.
(a) A manufactured/mobile home park, condominium residential
development or apartment development may include more
than one principal building per lot, provided all other
requirements of this chapter are met. A condominium form of
ownership of individual dwelling units, with a legally binding
homeowners' association, may be established if the applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, based upon
review by the Township Solicitor, that there will be appropriate

§ 203-802. Height exceptions.
The maximum structure height specified for each district shall not apply to:
antennas that meet the requirements of this chapter, water towers, clock
or bell towers, steeples of places of worship, electrical transmission lines
and towers, elevator shafts, stair towers, flag poles, windmills, skylights,
chimneys, heating/ventilation/air-conditioning equipment, smoke stacks,
parapet walls of up to four feet in height and other appurtenances usually
required to be and customarily placed above the roof level and not intended
for human occupancy. See also definition of "height" in § 203-202 and
provisions in § 203-307B.

buffer yards.
legal mechanisms in place and compliance with applicable
state law.
C. Minimum size of dwellings. Each dwelling unit shall include a minimum
of 600 square feet of enclosed habitable, indoor, heated floor area,
which shall be primarily above the ground level.
D. Maximum occupancy. No recreational vehicle shall be occupied on a lot
for more than 30 days in a calendar year, except as may be approved
within a campground with suitable central water and sewage service.
No mobile/manufactured home shall be occupied on a lot as a dwelling
unless it meets all of the requirements for a dwelling.
A. In general.
(1) No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in such a way
that it would result in another lot, building or use not being able to
meet the requirements of this chapter. This includes, but is not
limited to: setback areas, non-impervious areas and off-street
parking areas.
(2) Emergency access. All uses and structures shall have adequate
provisions for access by emergency vehicles and fire ladders. Such
access shall be maintained in a passable condition by the owner of
the lot or, where applicable, by the property owners' association.
B. Exceptions to minimum lot areas, lot widths and yards.
(1) Corner lots. For a corner lot, each yard that abuts a public street
shall be considered a front yard and meet the requirements for
minimum depth of a front yard. See definition of "lot, corner" in
§ 203-202.
(2) Projections into required yards.
(a) Cornices, eaves, roof overhangs, sills or other similar
architectural features, exterior stairways, unenclosed fire
§ 203-801 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-803
1:814
escapes or other required means of egress, rain leads,
chimneys, "Bilco"-type doors for basement access, window
awnings, footers, chaise for heating pipes or other similar
structures that do not include space usable by persons may
extend or project into a required yard not more than three
feet, except as may be required within a drainage or utility
easement.
(b) Steps, stoops, fire escapes, handicapped ramps, and landings
necessary to provide entrance to a building may be located
within a required setback area.
(c) For decks and porches, see § 203-307.
(3) Lot widths around curves. Around the bulb of a cul-de-sac street or
on the outside of the curve of a street with a radius of less than 150
feet, the minimum lot width at the minimum building setback line
may be reduced to 60% of the width that would otherwise be
required.
C. Sight clearance at intersections. At the intersection of two streets, a
clear sight triangle shall be provided. Within this triangle, no visual
obstructions shall be allowed between the height of three feet and 10
feet above the ground level, except for utility posts, mailboxes, single
sign posts and the trunks of deciduous trees. The triangle shall be
measured along the center line of the right-of-way line of the streets.
Each leg of the triangle shall be measured 75 feet from the intersection
of the center lines of the streets. A third longer leg shall connect the
two legs along the center lines, to form the triangle.
(1) However, in place of the above sight triangle, where a local street
intersects an arterial or collector street with a stop sign only at the
local street, the leg of the triangle along the arterial or collector
street shall be increased to 250 feet and the leg along the local
street shall be decreased to 20 feet beyond the right-of-way of the
arterial street.
(2) The clear sight triangle shall be kept free of such obstructions in
perpetuity.
(3) Where grading along a street is necessary to provide safe sight
distances, such grading shall not be prohibited by other provisions
of Township ordinances. Such grading should result in finished
slopes that are as close to the natural grades as is feasible.
[Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
D. Buffer yards. Plans for buffer yards and plant screening shall be
reviewed and approved by the Shade Tree Commission. Buffer yards
and plant screening, complying with the following standards, shall be
required under the following situations, unless a more-restrictive
provision is established by another section of this chapter. The Shade
Tree Commission, as it deems necessary, may permit modification of the
§ 203-803 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-803
1:815
following standards to address specific site constraints or landscaping
needs: [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
(1) A minimum 30 feet wide buffer yard with plant screening shall be
required along the rear and side lot lines of any lot used principally
for principal nonresidential purposes that is contiguous to a lot
occupied by an existing principal dwelling or an undeveloped
residentially zoned lot.
(a) If a principal business use will include areas used for
manufacturing or will have a loading dock that will be routinely
serviced by tractor-trailer trucks or refrigerated trucks, then
the minimum buffer yard width along such manufacturing area
and/or loading dock shall be increased to 70 feet, and the
minimum initial height of plantings shall be increased to eight
feet. However, the minimum buffer width shall be four feet
within the Village and TND Districts, and the buffer yard may
be waived by the Township as part of a traditional
neighborhood development approval if:
[1] The business use is built before the adjacent residential
use is sold; and
[2] The applicant proves compatibility as part of the master
plan review by the Township.
(b) If a lot will include more than 100,000 square feet of business
building floor area, then the minimum buffer yard width shall
be increased to 70 feet, and the minimum initial height of
plantings shall be increased to eight feet.
(c) If a dwelling will be on the same lot as a principal business use,
then a buffer yard shall not be required by this section.
(d) A 10 feet minimum buffer yard with landscaped screening shall
be required where a subdivision or land development of new
dwellings will have rear yards abutting a public street or
expressway.
(e) A buffer yard is also required to be provided by the following if
they are abutting and visible from a public street:
[1] Along lot lines of any newly developed or expanded
outdoor industrial storage or loading area; or
[2] Along lot lines of any newly developed or expanded area
routinely used for the overnight parking of two or more
tractor-trailer trucks or trailers of tractor-trailers.
(2) A required yard may overlap a required buffer yard, provided the
requirement for each is met. The buffer yard shall be measured
from the district boundary line, street right-of-way line or lot line,
whichever is applicable. Required plantings shall not be placed
§ 203-803 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-803
1:816
within the right-of-way, except that the Township may allow
deciduous canopy trees.
(3) The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures,
dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage, or display, signs,
manufacturing or processing activity, materials, loading and
unloading areas, or vehicle parking or display.
(4) Fence. Any wall or fence in a buffer yard shall be placed on the
inside (nonresidential side) of any required plant screening. If a
fence in a buffer yard has one side that is more finished or
smoother than the other side, the more-finished or smoother side
shall face the outside of the buffer yard. A fence in a commercial or
industrial district that is visible from the outside of the buffer yard
shall be constructed of wood planks, PVC panels, PVC picket-style
posts or similar designs, as opposed to chain-link metal or wood
sheeting. Any wall visible from the outside of the buffer yard shall
be constructed of brick, other decorative masonry, decorative
stucco, stone, or have the appearance of such materials.
(5) A well or septic system may be placed within a buffer yard,
provided the landscaping and tree preservation provisions are still
met.
(6) Each planting screen shall meet the following requirements:
(a) Plant materials needed to form the visual screen shall have a
minimum height when planted of four feet. In addition, an
average of one deciduous shade tree, with a minimum trunk
diameter of two inches measured six inches above the finished
ground level, shall be placed for each 50 feet of length of the
buffer yard. The shade trees may be clustered or spaced
unevenly.
(b) Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be of such
species, spacing and size as can reasonably be expected to
produce within three years a mostly solid year-round visual
screen at least three feet in height.
(c) The plant screen shall be placed so that at maturity the plants
will not obstruct a street or sidewalk.
(d) The plant visual screen shall extend the full length of the lot
line, except for:
[1] Township-approved points of approximately perpendicular
vehicle or pedestrian ingress and egress to the lot;
[2] Locations necessary to comply with safe sight distance
requirements where the plantings cannot feasibly be
moved further back; and
§ 203-803 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-803
1:817
[3] Locations needed to meet other specific state, Township
and utility requirements, such as stormwater swales.
(e) American arborvitae and similar weak-stem plants shall not be
used to meet the buffer yard requirements. A monotonous
straight row of the same species is discouraged. A morenaturalistic
form of planting is encouraged with a mix of
species. If more than 20 evergreen plants are proposed, no
more than 50% shall be of one species.
(f) Evergreen trees should be planted at diagonal offsets so that
there is room for future growth of the trees.
(g) The Board of Supervisors, upon recommendation of the Shade
Tree Commission, may approve alternate buffer designs and
locations that serve the same purpose, particularly when
necessary because of unique site conditions.
(h) If existing healthy trees with a trunk diameter of six inches or
greater (measured 4.5 feet above the ground level) exist within
the buffer yard, they shall be preserved to the maximum extent
feasible. The Zoning Officer may certify that preserving
existing mature trees and shrubs within the buffer yard will
meet the same purposes as the new plant screening. In such
case, part or all of the new plant screening may be waived in
writing by the Zoning Officer.
(i) The use of earth berms in combination with landscaping is
encouraged within buffer yards to provide additional
protection to dwellings and residential areas. An earth berm
may be required as a condition of a conditional or special
exception use approval.
(7) Buffer yard plans.
(a) Prior to the issuance of a permit under this chapter where a
buffer yard would be required, and on any required subdivision
or land development plan, the applicant shall submit plans
showing:
[1] The location and arrangement of each buffer yard;
[2] The placement, general selection of species and initial size
of all plant materials; and
[3] The placement, size, materials and type of all fences to be
placed in such buffer yard.
(8) Buffer yards, IN District. A minimum 30 feet wide buffer yard with
plant screening shall be required along the rear and side lot lines of
any lot used principally for single-family detached dwelling
purposes where said lot line is contiguous to a lot occupied by an
existing principal dwelling or undeveloped residentially zoned lot
§ 203-803 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-803
1:818
§ 203-804. Landscaping.
located within a residential zoning district under this chapter other
than the IN District. A minimum 60 feet buffer yard with plant
screening shall be required along the rear and side lot lines of
any lot used principally for any purpose other than single-family
detached dwelling purposes that is contiguous to a lot occupied by
an existing principal dwelling or undeveloped residentially zoned
lot located within a residential zoning district under this chapter
other than the IN District. The retention of existing mature trees
and shrubs may be substituted for the plant screening within the
buffer yard where approved by the Township. [Amended
4-1-2008 by Ord. No. 08-03]
A. Any part of a commercial, industrial, institutional or apartment lot
which is not used for structures, loading areas, parking spaces and
aisles, sidewalks, and designated storage areas shall be provided with
an all-season, well-maintained vegetative ground cover and shall be
landscaped with trees and shrubs. Landscaped areas shall be kept free
of debris, rubbish, and noxious weeds.
B. See the buffer yard provisions in § 203-803.
C. Street trees. As part of the creation of a new lot for any use, the
construction of a new principal nonresidential building, a new land
development, or development of parking area for six or more parking
spaces, deciduous shade street trees shall be planted between such lot
lines, building and/or parking area, and any adjacent public street(s).
This requirement shall not apply along street segments where existing
healthy trees will be preserved and protected during construction that
will serve the same purpose.
(1) Number. A minimum average of one such tree shall be planted for
each 50 feet of length of street right-of-way around the lot.
(2) Location. Such trees shall be placed immediately outside of the
street right-of-way, or an alternative location acceptable to the
Board of Supervisors.
(3) Ordinance. Such street trees shall be planted in a manner approved
by the Township Engineer to avoid conflicts with sidewalks and
utilities.
(4) Buffer. Where shade trees may be required under the buffer yard
provisions, the same tree may be used to count towards both
requirements.
(5) The street trees shall meet the requirements of § 203-804D.
D. Parking lot landscaping.
§ 203-803 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-804
1:819
(1) A minimum of one deciduous tree shall be required for every 15
new off-street parking spaces.
(2) If a lot will include 30 or more new parking spaces, landscaped
islands shall be provided within automobile parking areas.
Otherwise, the trees may be planted around the parking area. If a
parking area includes more than 50 off-street parking spaces, then
a minimum of 5% of the interior of the parking area shall be
landscaped. [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
(3) Deciduous trees required by this section shall meet the following
standards:
(a) Type of trees permitted. Required trees shall be chosen from
the list of approved street trees that is maintained by the
Township Shade Tree Commission. The Shade Tree
Commission may approve a proposal for an alternate species if
the applicant proves such species would shade paved areas, be
resistant to disease, road salt and air pollution and be
attractive and sturdy.
Note: This chapter only regulates the species of trees that are
used to meet requirements of the Township. The species of
trees that are not required by Township ordinances are not
regulated.
(b) Quality of trees. Required trees shall be of symmetrical growth
and free of insect pests and disease.
(c) Minimum size. The trunk diameter (measured at a height of six
inches above the finished grade level) shall be a minimum of
two inches or greater.
(d) Planting and maintenance. Required trees shall be:
[1] Planted in conformance with good landscaping practices,
with adequate unpaved surface around each for water and
air, and
[2] Properly protected by curbs, curbstops, distance, or other
devices from damage from vehicles.
(e) A minimum vegetative area shall be provided that includes at
least a four feet minimum radius around all sides of the trunk
of each required deciduous tree within or adjacent to a parking
lot. [Amended 11-20-2007 by Ord. No. 07-01]
E. Review and approval. Where landscaping is required by this chapter,
the applicant shall submit a landscaping plan, in addition to a site plan,
showing proposed initial sizes, locations and species of plantings.
F. Landscape maintenance. All tree, buffer yard and other landscaping
required by this chapter shall be perpetually maintained by the
§ 203-804 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-804
1:820
§ 203-805. Nonconformities.
property-owner. Any landscaping needed to meet an Ordinance
requirement that dies, is removed, or is severely damaged shall be
replaced by the current property-owner, on a one-to-one basis, as soon
as is practical considering growing seasons, within a maximum of 150
days.
G. Stormwater basin landscaping. The following requirements shall apply
to landscaping within and around stormwater management basins:
(1) All areas of stormwater management basins, including basin floors,
side slopes, berms, impoundment structures, or other earth
structures, shall be planted with suitable vegetation, such as
meadow plantings or grasses specifically suited for stormwater
basins.
(2) Trees and shrubs shall be planted around stormwater basins.
However, trees and shrubs shall not be planted in locations that
would interfere with the function of the basin, such as within 30
feet from the outlet/drain structure, emergency spillway or dam. A
minimum average of two trees and 10 shrubs shall be required to
be planted around the basin for every 100 linear feet of basin
perimeter. Such perimeter shall be measured at the elevation of the
top of the berm. Such trees and shrubs shall be in addition to other
Township requirements. Trees shall have an initial trunk diameter
of two inches, measured six inches above the ground. Shrubs shall
have an initial height of four feet.
(3) Natural ground cover plant species shall be planted in the floors
and slopes of the basin. These ground covers may include
wildflowers, meadows or nonaggressive grasses. Species shall be
chosen that are suitable for the expected wetness of various
portions of the basin. The plantings shall provide a continuous
cover over all earth areas of the basin. The plantings shall not
interfere with the proper functioning of the basin, in the
determination of the Township Engineer.
(4) Lawn grass areas may be sodded or hydroseeded to minimize
erosion during the establishment period. Once established,
turfgrass areas on nonwet areas of the basin shall be maintained at
a height of not more than six inches.
(5) To the maximum extent feasible, stormwater basins shall be
designed with slopes that blend with the surrounding topography.
Areas intended to be mowed shall have a maximum slope of 3:1.
A. Proof and registration of nonconformities. It shall be the responsibility
of, with the burden of proof upon, a party asserting a nonconformity to
provide the evidence that it is lawful. A property owner may request a
§ 203-804 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-805
1:821
written statement of nonconformity from the Zoning Officer after
providing sufficient evidence.
B. Continuation of nonconformities.
(1) A lawful nonconforming use, structure or lot, as defined by this
chapter, may be continued and may be sold and continued by new
owners.
(2) Any expansion of, construction upon or change in use of a
nonconformity shall only occur in conformance with this section.
(3) If an existing use was not lawfully established, it shall not have any
right to continue as a nonconforming use.
C. Expansion of or construction upon nonconformities. The following shall
apply, unless the structure is approved under § 203-805D:
(1) Nonconforming structure.
(a) The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to
be reconstructed or expanded, provided:
[1] That such action will not increase the severity or amount
of the nonconformity (such as the area of the building
extending into the required yard) or create any new
nonconformity; and
[2] That any expanded area will comply with the applicable
setbacks in that district and other requirements of this
chapter, except as may be allowed under Subsection
C(1)(c) and (d) below.
(b) In the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a
nonconforming use, any expansion shall also meet the
requirements of this section regarding nonconforming uses.
(c) Extension along a nonconforming setback. If an existing
building has a lawfully nonconforming side or rear building
setback, additions may occur to increase the height above such
setback or to extend other portions of the building out to the
nonconforming side or rear setback line, provided that:
[1] The structure shall not be extended beyond the existing
nonconforming setback line;
[2] No additional nonconformity is created;
[3] The new nonconforming extension is not greater than 25%
of the existing floor area of the building being expanded;
[4] All other requirements of this chapter shall be met; and
§ 203-805 LOWER PAXTON CODE § 203-805
1:822
[5] Such additions shall not be permitted for a nonresidential
building that abuts an existing primarily residential use.
(d) As a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may approve
a reduction of up to 50% in a side or rear setback for an
existing dwelling if the applicant proves such setback is
necessary to allow a customary addition of such dwelling or a
replacement of an existing undersized dwelling with a new
dwelling. This subsection shall not allow a reduction in setback
to increase the number of dwelling units on the lot, except for a
unit for care of relative.
(2) Nonconforming lots.
(a) Permitted construction on a nonconforming lot. A single
permitted by right principal use and its customary accessory
uses may be constructed, reconstructed or expanded on a
nonconforming lot provided all of the following additional
requirements are met:
[1] The lot must be a lawful nonconforming lot of record;
[2] Minimum setback requirements shall be met;
[3] State and federal wetland regulations shall be met; and
[4] If a septic or well is used, the requirements for such shall
be met.
(b) Lot width. The fact that an existing lawful lot of record does not
meet the minimum lot width requirements of this chapter shall
not by itself cause such lot to be considered to be a
nonconforming lot.
(3) Expansion of a nonconforming nonresidential use. A
nonconforming use or a building used by a nonconforming use shall
not be expanded, except in accordance with the following
provisions:
(a) An expansion of more than 5% in total building floor area shall
require special exception approval from the Zoning Hearing
Board under Article I.
(b) Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same
lot that the nonconforming use was located upon at the time
the use became nonconforming.
(c) The total building floor area used by a nonconforming use, or
the total land area covered by the nonconforming use,
whichever is more restrictive, shall not be increased by greater
than 50% beyond what existed in the nonconforming use at the
time the use first became nonconforming.
§ 203-805 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-805
1:823
[1] The above maximum increase shall be measured in
aggregate over the entire life of the nonconformity. All
expansions of the nonconforming use and/or building(s)
that occurred since the use originally became
nonconforming shall count towards the above maximum
increase.
(d) Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required
setbacks and other requirements of this chapter, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance.
(4) Expansion of a nonconforming residential use. An existing
nonconforming residential use may be expanded as a permitted by
right use, provided that: the number of dwelling units or rooming
house units are not increased; the expansion meets all applicable
setbacks;, no new types of nonconformities are created; and a
nonconformity is not made more severe. A lawfully nonconforming
dwelling in a business district may follow the dimensional
requirements for the R-2 District and may add customary accessory
uses.
(5) Nonconforming sign. The provisions of this chapter shall not
provide a right to expand or extend a nonconforming sign. Instead,
any expansions or extensions of a nonconforming sign shall comply
with this chapter.
D. Damaged or destroyed nonconformities. A nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use that has been destroyed or damaged may be rebuilt
in a nonconforming fashion only if: the application for a building permit
is submitted within 18 months after the date of damage or destruction;
work begins in earnest within six months afterwards and continues; and
no nonconformity may be newly created or increased by any
reconstruction. The property shall be properly secured during such
time in such a way to keep out trespassers and to avoid harm to
neighboring properties.
E. Abandonment of a nonconformity.
(1) If a nonconforming use of a building or land is discontinued, razed,
removed or abandoned for 12 or more months, subsequent use of
such building or land shall conform with the regulations of the
district in which it is located, except:
(a) As provided for in the "damaged or destroyed nonconformities"
provisions of this section in § 203-805D.
(2) The applicant shall be responsible to provide clear and convincing
evidence that the nonconformity was not abandoned.
(3) An existing lawful separate dwelling unit may be unrented for any
period of time without being considered "abandoned" under this
chapter.

§ 203-806. Dumpster screening and location. [Amended 11-20-2007
by Ord. No. 07-01]
F. Changes from one nonconforming use to another.
(1) Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land shall not
revert to a nonconforming use.
(2) A nonconforming use may be changed to a different nonconforming
use only if approved as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing
Board. However, special exception approval is not needed for a
simple change within an existing building from one lawful
nonconforming retail store use to another retail store use or from
one lawful nonconforming personal service use to another personal
service use, provided that the new use complies with any Zoning
Hearing Board conditions that applied to the previous use and is
not more objectionable in external effects than the previous use.
(3) Where special exception approval is required for a change of a
nonconforming use, the Board shall determine whether the
applicant has provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed
new use will be equal or less objectionable in external effects than
the preexisting nonconforming use with regard to:
(a) Traffic safety and generation (especially truck traffic);
(b) Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire,
hazardous substances, and explosive hazards;
(c) Amount and character of outdoor storage;
(d) Hours of operation if the use would be close to dwellings; and
(e) Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
(4) A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a nonconforming
adult use.
G. District changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become
nonconforming because of a zoning district change shall be regulated
under this section on nonconformities.
A. Any newly placed solid waste dumpster shall be screened on at least
three of four sides as necessary to screen views from public streets and
dwellings.
B. Such screening shall consist of decorative masonry walls, primarily
solid weather-resistant wood fencing, or fencing of a similar
