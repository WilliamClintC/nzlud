History1
In 1682, William Penn petitioned King Charles II to make payment in land for a
debt owed by the Crown to his father, an Admiral in the British Navy. The land was
called West New Jersey, which included the land west of the Delaware River that was
to later become Pennsylvania. Penn was granted a royal charter appointing Penn and
his heirs “true and absolute Proprietors of a tract of land, called Pennsylvania, lying
north of Maryland, south of New York”. He saw the land west of the Delaware as an
opportunity for his “Holy Experiment” - a Quaker colony, first called the Society of
Friends of West New Jersey, a realization of his ideal to enable Quaker households to
practice their discipline of familial and spiritual communities in an agrarian society.
Swedish, Finnish and Dutch settlements had existed along the rivers for several
decades before William Penn formed the three original counties: Chester, Bucks and
Philadelphia. The original Quaker homesteading settlements, the Cheshire or Chester
Meeting Tract, and the Welsh or Radnor Meeting Tract, were laid out between the
Delaware and the Schuylkill, covering parts of present day Chester, Delaware and
Montgomery Counties.
The Radnor Tract then extended only as far as Gulph Mills on the Schuylkill. But
the Quaker settlements soon went far beyond to land farther up the Schuylkill,
including The Pikelands. However, some of these properties became the tools of
speculators. Dr. Daniel Coxe, Court Physician to King Charles II and friendly with
William Penn, was able to obtain a land patent, together with investors Sir Matthias
Vincent and Major Robert Thompson, each having 10,000 of the 30,000 acres that make
up what are today four townships - East and West Pikeland, and East and West
Vincent. This was one of many pieces of land involved in a grand scheme that intended
to control the fur trade in beaver skins, all the way out to Lake Erie. Together with
other investors they formed the “New Mediterranean Sea Company” to pursue their
elaborate trading plan.
The early death of Vincent, and both the disinterest and early death of Thompson
were among many setbacks for Coxe in promoting the Company. Penn himself
complicated the finalizing of the legal deed of the Company, not being in favor of the
trade monopoly that it might represent, and possibly influenced by the fact that Coxe
was an Anglican, not a Quaker. For the land that would become the Pikelands, the
break with the Company came with the sale of Vincent’s 10,000 acres by his surviving
wife and family to a Mr. Joseph Pike, Quaker merchant, of Kilcreagh farm, County
Cork, Ireland.Coxe tried to purchase both the Vincent and Thompson acreage from the
estates to add to his own, but many delays drained his patience. He sold his 10,000
acres to the new West Jersey Company, and turned his speculation to the purchase of
land in the “Carolana” Tract, south of Virginia.
Pike’s Land was the first name given to the grant of 10,000 acres to Joseph Pike in
1705. Joseph Pike was the eldest son of an English father and an Irish mother. His
father had served in Cromwell’s army in Ireland with distinction, but both parents later

the Quaker faith. From agrarian family beginnings Joseph began in business at
age 18 as a wool trader and later as a dry goods merchant, opening a shop in Cork. In
the course of his business that took him to Holland and Flanders, he gained friendly
relations with William Penn. He was a strong supporter of Quaker teachings, writing
and publishing tracts. This and a friendship with a Thomas Story, another friend of
Penn, led to Story becoming Pike’s agent in Pennsylvania.
With the death of Joseph Pike in 1729, having never set foot in Pennsylvania, his
eldest son Richard became owner of Pike’s Pennsylvania properties, which included
land in Caln Township, in Bucks County and elsewhere. As agent he chose Michael
Lightfoot, brother of Samuel Lightfoot the surveyor, whose Quaker family lived in
Pikeland and later built the first grist mill on Pickering Creek. Richard died in 1755
and his executors, Samuel Hoare and Nathaniel Newberry of London appointed Michael
Lightfoot’s sons, Thomas and William, as agents. Hoare was a brother in law to Richard
Pike.
Pikelanders had lived on the land for more than half a century, paying taxes
assessed under “Pikeland Township.” With the lingering uncertainty of deed to their
land, they were all still tenants. Hoare administered the properties, pursuing collection
of rents from the Pikelands tenants. After Richard’s death, he moved to sell the land to
the leaseholders, who formed themselves into the loosely-knit “Pikeland Company” in
1762 to negotiate with Hoare. A court battle with the Pike family contesting Richard’s
will continued, based on a charge of mental incapacity when it was written, but the
outcome gave Hoare undisputed control, acting as owner of the properties by 1764.
Hoare offered a deal to the Pikeland Company to enable the tenants to purchase their
holdings, with L 2,500 down payment and L 4,000 per year for 3 years, beginning in
1763. This was divided on the basis of property value, and 68 tenants signed for it.
Apparently Lightfoot, the agent, had great difficulty collecting. After years of
frustration, Hoare replaced the Lightfoots in 1773 with Andrew Allen, attorney and
member of the first Continental Congress. Hoare soon conveyed the properties to Allen
for a L 16,000 mortgage.
At this point a new period of confusing and obscure history began that lasted
another 30 years. Allen was a Tory. In 1776 he departed for England and much of his
property was sold by the Pennsylvania Assembly. In the charged atmosphere of the war,
the Pikeland papers were lost, Hoare was trying to collect his mortgage, and finally in
1786 Hoare transferred his Trust powers to Benjamin Chew, who began a new period
of negotiations with the Pikeland Company. By 1792, accommodation had largely been
reached, so that valid titles to Pikeland lands were finally obtained for the most diligent
tenants. Others who could not or did not pay were less fortunate.
By the end of the 18th Century, the distance from a hundred years of uncertainty
was sufficient to enable a new foundation for growth. In the northern Pikelands close
to Phoenixville and the transportation corridors, the character of growth began to
diverge from that of the Pickering Valley, which maintained a more rural character. In
1838, the differences had grown such that a division in the townships was decided - into
East Pikeland and West Pikeland. Thus two Pikeland municipalities have come down
to us.
East Pikeland was directly involved in the Revolutionary War, especially from 1775
through 1778, and most heavily during the “Philadelphia Campaign” in 1777 and 1778.
It was a source of provisions for the Army from its farms, mills and cottage industries.
Military importance came in 1775 with the authorization by the Committee of Safety
in Philadelphia from the Continental Powder Mill, and the site chosen was at Rapps
-viiiDam
on French Creek. The mill was a key element in a system of munitions supply that
involved the Warwick and Reading iron furnaces near the headwaters of French Creek,
which together with other furnaces such as Hopewell produced cannon and ammunition
for Washington. The prime location of the mill on the creek with its long millrace was
not forgotten after the war. Some of the mill buildings were reconstructed and over the
next 150 years, continued to operate variously as oil, saw, grist and spoke mills; in the
historic Snyder’s Mill, of which the remnants can still be seen today at the site of the
powder works, located northwest side of Rapp’s dam Road, southwest of French Creek.
Other mills in the area that would later become a successful were a Grist Mill called
Prizer’s Mill, which closed in 1954 and is on the National Register and Chrisman’s mill
(now the Kimberton Post Office) located in the center of Kimberton Village and
operated until 1938.
Kimberton Village is a quaint 18th century village located off Route 113. The
Kimberton Historic District includes sixty-two buildings and two structures along three
eighteenth and nineteenth century roadways that helped to make the village a local
education, market, and transportation center. The village is also locally significant for
its namesake, Emmor Kimber, an enterprising educator who arrived here in 1817 and
promptly established himself as the community’s leading citizen and a prominent
county figure. Kimber started a French Creek Boarding School for girls in 1818 and
later in 1820 built the Kimberton Inn, which was intended to house the relatives of his
students at the school. After Kimber died in 1850, the school was renamed Kimberton
Academy. In addition to those establishments, Kimber was also an instrumental figure
in founding the Schuylkill navigational canal and the Reading Railroad.
He also had a reputation of being an active abolitionist and the boarding school was
reportedly a stop on the Underground Railroad. Kimberton’s architecture reflects the
village’s two phases of growth. At the district’s western end, around an early crossroads
(Kimberton and Hare’s Hill roads), stand eighteenth and early nineteenth century stone
buildings that are representative of the eighteenth century vernacular architecture of
this part of Chester County. George Chrisman who built and owned Chrisman’s mill
was also the owner of the Sign of the Black Bear Tavern which was also located at the
main Kimberton Village intersection and is still standing today. The opposite end of the
district reflects the development of building lots around the post-Civil War railroad
station. The regular plan and sitting of house in this section of the district are
distinctive in comparison to other historic villages in northern Chester County.
The building of permanent churches in the Pikeland began when the “Pikeland
Lutheran Congregation beyond the Schuylkill” was formed in 1743, on the influence
ofHenry Muhlenberg. The Zion Lutheran church also called the “The Old Organ
Church” replaced in 1771 and it was actually used as a hospital by General Washington’s
troops in 1777. Another church that formed in the township was the Centennial
Lutheran Church at Kimberton located at the intersection of Coldstream and Hares Hill
Roads.
There were two railroads that formerly existed and provided service to Kimberton
and the township. They were the short lived “Sow Belly” Railroad and the once booming
Pickering Valley Railroad. The Sow Belly had a reputation of having tracks that were
very winding and had bends that went all over the place and was thus not very useful
and did not last long. On the other hand the Pickering Valley Railroad was wildly
successful for many years, because of the financial upturn it spiked in Kimberton due
to its shipping of crops and other cargo.
-ixThe
name of French Creek - also called the Vincent River on some records, is
thought to have come from the interest of early pioneers in the area, many of whom
were French. Such a Frenchman, Peter Bezallion, is said to have lived, about 1700, in
a cave where French Creek empties into the Schuylkill. But it may also be an
alliteration of “Friend’s Creek,” from its Quaker settlers. The Indian name, Sankanac,
means “Flint River.”
Bridges have also played a crucial role in East Pikeland’s overall transportation
over the years. The two most important being the Hare’s Hill Road Bridge also called
the Silver Bridge and the Rapps Dam Covered Bridge which is one of the only 15 active
covered bridges currently in existence in Chester County. The Rapps Dam Bridge was
built in 1866 and is on Rapps Dam Road in East Pikeland and Hare’s Hill Bridge on
Hare’s Hill Road was built in 1869.
East Pikeland Township has seen considerable change since the early part of the
20th Century. The area around Kimberton saw expanded housing areas, as did the
corridors near Routes 23 & 724. Only the main roads were paved, according to a 1938
map. The reason for the growth in the township over the years has been an influx of
population that has found East Pikeland Township an attractive and practical place to
live. The suburbanization of the township, as most areas, occurred as the availability
of automobiles made the general population mobile. In 1940, the township population
was 976. Space to house the ever-increasing population came from the conversion of
lands that had traditionally been dairy or wheat farms. Although some farms remain
today, the predominant land use pattern in the central portion of the township is
residential. The spread of suburban development has occurred primarily in the French
Creek valley, along Cold Stream Road. Also occurring since World War II has been the
development of townhouse complexes, shopping centers and industrial sites, such as the
Cromby Power Station (PECO) and shopping centers along Routes 23 & 724. The
closing of the remaining one and two room school houses occurred in the 1950's, in favor
of the regional school system.
In recent years stemming back to the 80's, East Pikeland has also opened itself up
to the production of local Community Supported Agriculture which contribute fresh
organic crops to the local community. These CSA’s include: Kimberton CSA, Charlestown
Farm, Sankanac farm, and Seven Stars Farm. Also The First Municipal Park
dedicated to Public use; Kimberton Park, was established in 1998.
East Pikeland Township is a township of the second class operating under the
Pennsylvania Second Class Township Code. The Board of Supervisors is the governing
body, with three members elected at large by the voters for staggered six-year terms.
They are responsible for both the legislative and executive functions of the township.
The township manager is appointed by the board and is responsible for the day-to-day
business activities of the township. The manager coordinates the work of all operating
departments and is directly responsible to the Board of Supervisors.
The Code of Ordinances of the Township of East Pikeland was prepared by
Keystate Publishers, Inc., and adopted by the Township of East Pikeland Board of
Supervisors on June 5, 2012, by Ord. 156.
Organization
The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of the
Township of East Pikeland contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix, which
lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or “one time” nature, (3) the Table
-xof
disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the Township of East Pikeland, and (4)
the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement of subjects.
In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific ordinances can
be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each Chapter. The Index
may also be used to search for a subject when one is looking for general information on
a particular subject, or if it is not known in which Chapter the subject might be found.
The Appendix consists of several general categories containing a chronological listing
of short subject descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its
date of enactment, if known.
The Table of disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Township of
East Pikeland Board of Supervisors with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An
ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another ordinance,
(3) is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in the Appendix. Annual
tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the Table. The Table is a cross
reference to the original ordinance books of the Township of East Pikeland, and to the
location within the Code of each ordinance by number.

Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be deemed to
govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the Code. The headings
of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code are intended as mere captions

deemed to be taken as titles of such Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any

(Ord. 156, 6/5/2012)
§1-105 Township of East Pikeland §1-107
1-4
§1-105. Tenses, Gender and Number.
Except as may be otherwise stated in any provision of this Code, the present tense
includes the past and future tenses, and the future the present; the masculine gender
includes the feminine and neuter, the feminine includes the masculine and neuter, and
the neuter includes the masculine and feminine; and the singular includes the plural,
and the plural the singular.
(Ord. 156, 6/5/2012)
§1-106. Construction.
1. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any provision of this Code,
the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. §1501 et seq., shall be applied in
construing this Code.
2. Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
A. The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its expiration by virtue of any
provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued or any offense
committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding commenced
before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
B. When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section, ordinance, clause
or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive
such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision, unless it shall be
expressly so provided.
3. Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same as those
ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption of this Code, are
intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions and regulations and not as
a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall not affect any suit or prosecution
pending or to be instituted to enforce any of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except
as specifically stated in this Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation,
codification and revision of the ordinances and regulations, it is the intention of the
Board of Supervisors that no ordinance or regulation of the Township be amended,
revised or repealed by implication.
4. Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain resolutions,
that is, actions of the Board of Supervisors (in written form and designated “resolution”)
which did not require prior public notice in accordance with the provisions of the Second
Class Township Code, 53 P.S. §65101 et seq., at the time of their passage by the Board
of Supervisors. Such “resolutions” are included herein for ease of reference and the
Board of Supervisors does not intend by their inclusion herein to require prior public
notice before amending, revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may
have been included herein in the future. It is the intention of the Board of Supervisors
that such actions of the Board of Supervisors that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance
(requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the simple fact
of inclusion in this Code.
(Ord. 156, 6/5/2012)
§1-107. Normal Numbering.
§1-107 Administration and Government §1-108
1-5
1. Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
2. Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
3. Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into Subchapters
1A and 1B.
4. Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a Part
such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a hyphen,
followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the Part. For
example, “§1-101" designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1. Similarly, “§27-305"
designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
5. Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are necessary,
Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into Paragraphs, Paragraphs
into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and Clauses into Subclauses, and
Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:
1. Subsection.
A. Paragraph.

(Ord. 156, 6/5/2012)
§1-108. Special Numbering Problems.
1. Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary to
introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or Sections,
the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition of a capital letter
suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number. Thus, a Chapter introduced
between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and Sections in that Chapter would be
numbered, for instance, “§5A-101.” If it becomes necessary to introduce a Part between
existing Parts 5 and 6 the new Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would
be numbered, for instance, “§5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing
Sections 5 and 6 would be “§5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have
been introduced the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
2. If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections, for
instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be numbered Subsection .5-A.
3. If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a Subsection between
existing units, the entire Subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
4. Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or repeal, the
remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old numbers until the overall
unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the vacated number may be marked:
“[Reserved].”

1-6
§1-109. Amending Code.
1. All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which amend,
repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance with the
numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the case of repealed
Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs, Clauses or other part or provision hereof, by
subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be excluded from this Code by
omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances as
numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence
of such subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code and subsequent ordinances
omitted are readopted as a new Code by the Board of Supervisors.
2. Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific reference
to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of this Code in the following
language:
A. Amendment or Revision. “Chapter , Part , Section , Subsection
, is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . . . .” The amended or revised
provisions may then be set out in full as desired.
B. Addition. “Chapter , Part , Section , Subsection , is hereby
amended by the addition of the following . . . .” The new provision shall then be set
out in full as desired.
C. Repeal. “Chapter , Part , Section , Subsection , is hereby
repealed in its entirety.”
3. It is the intention of the Board of Supervisors that the numbering scheme of
this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event that any ordinance
or other enactment be adopted which does not conform to the numbering system of this
Code, it is the intention of the Board of Supervisors that such enactment be renumbered
in the process of supplementing, revising or updating this Code to conform to the
numbering scheme of this Code. The Board of Supervisors hereby acknowledges and
confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for ease of reference and that the
renumbering of any enactment when added to this Code shall not in any manner affect
the validity of said enactment.
(Ord. 156, 6/5/2012)
§1-110. Altering Code.
It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or deletion any
part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter
or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution
or other official act of the Board of Supervisors.
(Ord. 156, 6/5/2012)
§1-111. Penalties.
1. Penalty Where No Penalty Provided. Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance
of the Township any act is prohibited or is declared to be unlawful, or whenever in this
Code or other ordinance the doing of any act is declared to be unlawful, and no specific
penalty is provided therefor:
A. Violations of Health, Safety and Welfare Provisions. For violations of
§1-111 Administration and Government §1-111
1-7
ordinances adopting building, housing, property maintenance, health, fire or public
safety codes; and for ordinances regulating water services, water pollution, air
pollution and noise, the following penalty shall be provided:
(1) Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of this
Part, upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a magisterial district
judge in the manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses under
the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine
of not more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and
costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a
violation of this Part continues or each Section of this Part which shall be
found to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense.
B. Other Violations. All other penalties, except for penalties in Chapter
15, “Motor Vehicles and Traffic” (based on the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. §101 et
seq.), penalties and ordinances adopted under the authority of the Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq., earned income tax ordinances adopted under
the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. §6913, and ordinances adopted under the
authority of the Sewage Facilities Act, 35 P.S. §750.1 et seq., should provide,
generally:

permitted the violation of any provision of this Part, upon being found liable
therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, shall
pay a judgment of not more than $600 plus all court costs. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination
of a violation by a magisterial district judge. If the defendant neither pays nor
timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure, at which time, in addition
to any penalties, the violator shall be liable for any attorney’s fees and costs
incurred by the Township. Each day that a violation continues or each Section
of this Part which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a
separate violation.
2. The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not prevent
the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other punitive or remedial action
where called for or permitted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
the United States of America. In addition, the Township may institute injunctive,
mandamus or any other appropriate action or proceeding at law or in equity for the
enforcement of this Code. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the right to
issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus, or other
appropriate forms of remedy or relief.

CCDES–Chester County Department of Emergency Services.
FCC–Federal Communications Commission.
NPSPAC–National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee.
(Ord. 174, 4/5/2016, §2)
§5-302. General Provisions.
Except as otherwise provided, no person shall erect, construct, alter, refit, change the
use of, or provide an addition of more than 20 percent of the existing floor area to, any
building or structure or any part thereof, or cause the same to be done, which fails to support
adequate radio coverage for CCDES, the East Pikeland Township Police Department,
and the Kimberton Fire Department, and for the purposes of this Section,
adequate radio coverage shall include all of the following:
A. A minimum signal strength of -95 dBm available in 95 percent for the area of
each floor of the building.
B. A minimum signal strength of -95 dBm received at the closest CCDES radio
communications site when transmitted from 95 percent of the area of each floor of the
building.
C. The frequency range which must be supported shall be between 763 MHz and
861 MHz.
D. A 90 percent reliability factor.
E. Signal strength measurements, for the purpose of measuring the performance
of a bi-directional amplifier, shall be based on one input signal adequate to obtain a
maximum continuous operating output level.
The provisions of this Section shall become applicable upon notification to the property
owner that unacceptable performance levels exist. The property owner shall have 90
days from date of notification, to enhance radio coverage and bring it within the acceptable
limits of these provisions.
(Ord. 174, 4/5/2016, §2)
§5-303. Amplification Systems Allowed.
Buildings and structure which cannot support the required level of radio coverage
shall be equipped with either a radiating cable system or an internal multiple antenna
system with or without FCC type accepted bi-directional 700/800 MHz amplifiers as
needed. If any part of the installed system or systems contains an electrically powered
component, the system shall be capable of operating on an independent battery and/or
§5-304 Township of East Pikeland §5-304
Supp. II; revised 4/5/2016 5-12
generator system for a period of at least 12 hours without external power input. The battery
system shall charge in the presence of an external power input.
(Ord. 174, 4/5/2016, §2)
§5-304. Testing Procedures.
1. Acceptance Test Procedure.
A. When an in-building radio system is required, and upon completion of installation,
it will be the building owner’s responsibility to have the radio system tested to
ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 95 percent.
Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of approximately 20 equal
areas. A maximum of two nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. In the
event that 3 of the areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the
floor may be divided in 40 equal areas. In such event, a maximum of 4 nonadjacent
areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the 40 area test, if the system continues to
fail, the building owner shall have the system altered to meet the 95 percent coverage
requirement.
B. The test shall be conducted using the most current portable radio or its equivalent,
available to the East Pikeland Township Police and/or Fire Department,
talking though the CCDES as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A spot
located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then
the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of
the building through the CCDES. Once the spot has been selected, prospecting for a
better spot within the grid area will not be permitted.
C. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement
results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be
verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurements
results become lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test
to reestablish the gain values.
2. Annual Tests. When an in-building radio system is required, the building owner
shall test all active components of the system, including but not limited to amplifiers,
power supplies and backup batteries, a minimum of once every 12 months. Amplifiers
shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and
acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a period
of one hour to verity that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If
within the one-hour test period, in the opinion of the testing technician, the battery
exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one-hour periods
until the testing technician confirms the integrity of the battery. All other active components
shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturer’s
specifications for the intended period.
3. Five-Year Tests. In addition to the annual test, the building owner shall perform a
radio coverage test a minimum of once every 5 years to ensure that the radio system continues
to meet the requirements of the original acceptance test. The procedure set forth
above shall apply to such tests. A copy of the accepted tests shall be provided to the Chester
County Department of Emergency Services.
4. Qualifications of Testing Personnel. All tests shall be conducted, documented and
signed by a person in possession of a current FCC technician license, or a current technician
certification issued by APCO, NABER, or PCIA. All test records shall be retained on
§5-305 Code Enforcement §5-307
5-13 Supp. II; revised 4/5/2016
the inspected premises by the building owner and a copy submitted to officials of the East
Pikeland Township Police Department and the Kimberton Fire Department.
(Ord. 174, 4/5/2016, §2)
§5-305. Field Testing.
Police and Fire personnel, after providing reasonable notice to the owner or his representative,
shall have the right to enter onto the property to conduct field testing to be certain
that the required level of radio coverage is present.
(Ord. 174, 4/5/2016, §2)
§5-306. Exemptions.
This chapter shall not apply to structures in Use Groups R-3 and R-4 of the International
Building Code, any building constructed of wood frame, any building 35 feet high
or less, as long as none of the aforementioned buildings make use of any metal construction
or any underground storage or parking areas. For purposes of this chapter, parking

structure located within East Pikeland Township under the terms of §508(a) of the
Insurance Company Law of 1921, as amended, 40 P.S. §638(a), unless the insurance
company, association or exchange is furnished with a certificate pursuant to §7-302 of
this Part and unless there is compliance with the procedures set forth in §§7-303 and
7-304 of this Part.
(Ord. 75, 4/18/1995, §1)
§7-302. Fire Loss Certificates.
1. The Township Treasurer shall, upon the written request of the named insured
specifying the tax description of the property, name and address of the insurance

following within 14 working days of the request:
A. A certificate or, at the discretion of the Township, a verbal notification
which shall be confirmed in writing by the insured to the effect that, as of the date
specified in the request, there are no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or

2. Receipts.
A. Upon receipt of a certificate pursuant to subsection .1.A of this Section,
the insurance company, association or exchange shall pay the claim of the named
insured in accordance with the policy terms, unless the loss agreed to between the
named insured and the company, association or exchange equals or exceeds 60
percent of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building

When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company, association
or exchange equals or exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire
policies covering the building or other structure, the insurance company, association or

security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred by the
Township. When transferring the funds as required in §7-303, an insurance company,
association or exchange shall provide the Township with the name and address of the
named insured, whereupon the Township shall contact the named insured, certify that
the proceeds have been received by the Township and notify the named insured that the
procedures under this Part shall be followed. The fund shall be returned to the named
insured when repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure have been
completed and the required proof received by the Township Secretary if the Township
has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing. If the Township has
incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, the
costs shall be paid from the fund, and, if excess funds remain, the Township shall
transfer the remaining funds to the named insured. Nothing in this Part shall be
construed to limit the ability of the Township to recover any deficiency. Further,
nothing in this Part shall be construed to prohibit the Township and the named insured
from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named
insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damage property has been
negotiated.

Weeds and Vegetation
§10-101. Title.
This Part shall be known as the “Weed Ordinance of 1971.”
(Ord. 23, 10/5/1971, §1)
§10-102. Prohibition.
Growth of noxious weeds, plants, vegetation, and growths in excess of 12 inches on
property within the Township which is within 100 feet of an adjoining property on which
there is a dwelling or accessory building within 100 feet of the property line is declared to
be a public nuisance and prohibited within the Township.
Exception: The prohibition of growth of vegetation does not apply to a meadow. A
meadow is defined as a plant community or area of vegetation dominated by grasses and/
or flowering plants, often managed through annual or seasonal mowing. Meadows may
be naturally occurring or artificially created. In agriculture, a meadow is grassland which
is not regularly grazed by domestic livestock, but rather allowed to grow in order to produce
hay.
(Ord. 23, 10/5/1971, §2; as amended by Ord. 189, 5/7/2019)
§10-103. Interpretation.
This Part shall not be interpreted or construed to apply to land under active agricultural
or farm use and on which legitimate crops are grown at the time the prohibitions of
this Part are invoked.
(Ord. 23, 10/5/1971, §3)
§10-104. Notice to Violators.
Whenever the growth of noxious weeds, plants, etc., is permitted to exceed the levels
set forth in §10-102, the Township Secretary shall cause notice in writing to be given to
the owner of any land on which such growth in excess of the specified limits is found to
exist. The notice shall specify the type and location of the offending growth and require
removal thereof within 5 days of the date of the notice. If the address of the owner is not
known, notice shall be by posting of the property. Failure of any owner to comply with the
requirements of such notice within 5 days after receipt or posting thereof shall be prima
facie evidence of a violation of this Part.
(Ord. 23, 10/5/1971, §4)
§10-105. Powers of Township.
In the event of the failure of an owner after proper notice to comply with the notice
and with the terms of this Part, the Township may at its own option mow, destroy, and
dispose of such noxious weeds and growth in such fashion as the Township Supervisors
shall see fit. Such action by the Township shall not relieve the owner of penalties for violation
of this Part. The Township may by proper accounting means compute the cost of
such action on its part and either file a lien against the property on which such action
was taken or proceed by civil suit against the owner of the property on which the action
was taken.
(Ord. 23, 10/5/1971, §5)
§10-106 Township of East Pikeland §10-106
Supp. V; revised 5/7/2019 10-4
§10-106. Penalties.
Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of this Part, upon conviction
thereof in an action brought before a magisterial district judge in the manner provided
for the enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of
Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $15 nor more than
$1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment
not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues or each Section
of this Part which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a separate
offense.

“WHEREAS, East Pikeland Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, has experienced considerable
growth in the form of residential, commercial and industrial development in recent years; and
WHEREAS, it is anticipated that such development will continue into the future, and that such future
development will create a substantial impact upon the transportation facilities within East Pikeland
Township; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of East Pikeland Township is required to keep all roads open, in
repair and usable for the safe and convenient travel by the public, and the fulfillment of such duty will
entail substantial costs directly attributable to the impact of such future development; and
WHEREAS, Article V-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as added by Act No. 1999-
209, as amended, 53 P.S. §10501-A et seq., commonly known as Act 209 and hereinafter referred to
as the “Act”, establishes a comprehensive legislative scheme for the imposition of all or a portion of
said costs upon such future development by way and in the nature of an impact fee; and
WHEREAS, the amount of such impact fee shall be determined by the cost of the additional
transportation improvements needed to meet minimum safety and capacity standards, which
improvements shall be identified in a transportation capital improvements plan, considering the
projected growth and development in designated transportation service areas; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of East Pikeland Township hereby finds and declares that an
impact fee imposed upon residential and non-residential development, in order to assist in the
financing of specified major transportation capacity improvements in designated transportation service
areas, the demand for which is uniquely created by such development, is in the best interest of the
Township and its residents, is equitable, and does not impose an unfair burden on such development;
and
WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of East Pikeland Township originally gave notice of the intention
of the Township to enact a transportation impact fee ordinance by publishing a statement of such
intention twice in The Phoenix, a newspaper of general circulation in the township, the first publication
being on July 5, 2005, and the second publication being on July 12, 2005.
WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of East Pikeland Township adopted Ordinance 109 dated July
19, 2005, which established a transportation impact fee.

§12-108. Special Traffic Studies.
Where intended to assist in determining the appropriate amount of traffic impact
fees, the Township may require the preparation of special transportation studies to determine
the traffic generation or circulation patterns in new non-residential developments
only; provided, however, that no studies may be required where the proposed development
will not require a deviation from the land use assumptions resulting in increased
density, intensity or trip generation by a particular development.
A special transportation study, if required, shall be prepared by a qualified traffic or
transportation engineer in accordance with generally accepted transportation planning
and engineering standards.
Any such studies required by the Township shall be submitted prior to the imposition
of the impact fee and shall be considered in the determination of the fee.

§12-112. Calculation of Impact Fees.
1. The impact fee for transportation capital improvements shall be based upon the
total costs of the road improvements included in the adopted Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan within a given transportation service area attributable to and necessitated
by new development within the service areas as defined, divided by the number of
anticipated peak-hour trips generated by all new development consistent with the
adopted land use assumptions and calculated in accordance with the Trip Generation
Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, 9th or subsequent editions,
which is hereby adopted by the Township, to equal a per-trip cost for transportation
improvements within the service area.
2. The specific impact fee for a specific new development or subdivision within the
service area for road improvements shall be determined as of the date of preliminary
land development or subdivision approval by multiplying the per-trip cost established for
the service areas as determined in subsection .1 of this Section by the estimated number
of peak hour trips to be generated by the new development or subdivision using generally
accepted traffic engineering standards.
3. The Board of Supervisors may authorize or require the preparation of a special
transportation study in order to determine traffic generation or circulation for a new nonresidential
development to assist in the determination of the amount of the transportation
fee for such development or subdivision.

Additional transportation service areas or combinations of transportation service
areas may be designated by the Board of Supervisors from time to time consistent with
the procedure set forth in this Part and in consideration of the following factors:
A. The Comprehensive Plan;
B. Any standards for adequate public facilities incorporated in the program;
C. The projected build-out and timing of development areas;
D. The need for cost of unprogrammed transportation improvements necessary
to support projected development; and
E. Such other factors as the Board of Supervisors may deem relevant.
Fees collected from development in each of the transportation service areas will be
used exclusively to fund transportation improvement projects scheduled for that district.

(Ord. 109, 7/19/2005, §15; as amended by Ord. 178, 12/13/2016, §15)
§12-116. Method of Payment.
Payment of the transportation capital improvements impact fee shall be made by the
traffic generator prior to the issuance of a building permit by the Township to the traffic
generator for development on the applicable site.
(Ord. 109, 7/19/2005, §16; as amended by Ord. 178, 12/13/2016, §16)
§12-117. Credit.
Any applicant who shall perform, at his own expense and with the consent and agreement
of the Board of Supervisors, off-site improvements, as herein defined, shall be eligible
for a credit from the impact fee otherwise due in the amount of the actual cost for such
off-site improvements as approved by the Township Engineer. Such credit shall not
exceed the amount of the impact fee.
A. If the applicant makes such improvements, he must enter into an agreement
with the Board of Supervisors prior to the issuance of any building permit. The agreement
must establish the estimated cost of the improvement, the schedule for initiation
and completion of the improvement, a requirement that the improvement be
completed to Township and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards
and design criteria and such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the
Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors must review the improvement plan,
§12-118 Township of East Pikeland §12-118
Supp. III; revised 12/13/2016 12-8
verify costs and time schedules, determine if the improvement is an eligible improvement,
and determine the amount of the applicable credit for such improvement to be
applied to the otherwise applicable impact fee prior to issuance of any building permit.
In no event shall the Board of Supervisors provide a credit which is greater than
the amount of the impact fee due; the applicant may use such excess credit toward
the impact fees imposed on other building permits for development on the same site
and in the same ownership.
Provided any such applicant shall be required to supply financial security sufficient,
in the judgment of the Township, to cover the cost of any such improvement
installed by the applicant for which credit is sought.
B. An applicant shall be entitled as a credit against impact fees an amount equal
to the fair market value of land dedicated by the applicant and accepted by the Township
for future right-of-way, realignment or widening of existing roadways. The fair
market value shall be determined as of the date of submission of the land development
or subdivision application with the Township.
C. An applicant shall be entitled as a credit against impact fees an amount equal
to the value of any road improvement construction which is contained in the Transportation
Capital Improvements Plan and which was performed at the applicant’s
expense. The amount of the credit shall be the amount allocated in the capital
improvement program, including contingency factors.
(Ord. 109, 7/19/2005, §17; as amended by Ord. 178, 12/13/2016, §17)
§12-118. Refunds.
Impact fees collected pursuant to this Part shall be refunded, together with interest
earned thereon, to the payor of the fees under the following circumstances:
A. In the event that Township completes or terminates the capital improvements
plan and there remain undisbursed funds, the respective payors shall be entitled to a
share of the fund balance in the same proportion as the payor’s impact fee payment
plus interest. The Township shall provide notice to the payor of the availability of the
funds by certified mail.
B. In the event any specific road improvement project is completed at a cost to
the Township less than 95 percent of the budgeted cost of the road project, the Township
shall refund an amount equal to the excess budgeted cost over actual cost to the
payors, pro rata, plus accumulated interest.
C. In the event the Township fails to commence construction within 3 years of
the scheduled construction date of the project as set forth in the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan, the Township shall refund the portion of the fee paid by any
payor making written request therefor which is attributable to said project, with
accumulated interest, provided no refund shall be paid with respect to any project
actually begun prior to the receipt of such refund request.
D. In the event the development for which impact fees were paid has not commenced
prior to the expiration of the building permit issued therefor, the impact fees
paid with accumulated interest shall be refunded to the payor. Further, if a building
permit after issuance is altered in such a way as to reduce the indicated impact fee,
the difference between the amount indicated and the amount actually paid shall be
refunded. The payor, at his option, may roll over the impact fees attributable to an
expired building permit to cover fees incurred by a renewal of said expired permit.
With respect to refunds arising out of subsection .A or .B of this Section, any funds
§12-119 Impact Fees §12-122
12-9 Supp. III; revised 12/13/2016
unclaimed within 1 year after notice as required by law shall be transferred to the general
account of the Township, and the payor’s entitlement to said refund shall lapse. It is
the responsibility of the payor to provide the Township with the current address of his
place of business.

requirements imposed by the Township on the development of land or the issuance of
building permits. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to alter or affect the Township’s
existing ordinances and regulations regarding on-site improvements. In no event
shall a property owner be obligated to pay for transportation capital improvements in an
amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this Part; provided, however, that
a property owner may be required to pay, pursuant to Township ordinances, regulations
or policies, for other public facilities in addition to the impact fee for transportation
improvements as provided herein.

and PRD for which an application has been filed on or after the first publication of
notice of the Township’s intent to adopt the ordinance codified in this Part; provided,

that created the advisory committee in connection herewith.
2. In retroactive applications, the per-trip fee may not exceed previously established
impact fee of $3,447.

intended purposes unless prior approval is granted in writing by the Park and
Recreation Board.
(3) The approved user of the playing fields may not sublet or transfer its
rights and privileges to any other individual, group or organization, without

grant a written waiver from the above regulations in order to resolve special
problems that may arise.

16-7
§16-103 Township of East Pikeland §16-104
groups shall receive notification of the event no less than 3 weeks prior to the
special event.
(4) By its submission of an application, applicant agrees that the Board
of Supervisors and Park and Recreation Board shall not be held responsible or
accountable for any action taken in accordance with these regulations, and
shall be held harmless and immune from liability and suit by the applicant for
its action taken pursuant to these rules and regulations.

§16-104. Recreation Field and Facility Use Allocation.
The Board of Supervisors, in recognition of the ever increasing demand within the
Township for the use of active recreation areas and playing fields and the limited
number and availability of existing playing fields within the Township, hereby adopts
the following policy to be used in the allocation of recreation facilities under control of
the Park and Recreation Board.
A. East Pikeland Township Park and Recreation programs and/or activities
have preference over all requests for fields and/or facilities.
B. Organizations which provide youth sports and other recreational activities
for the residents of East Pikeland Township will receive secondary use approval of
recreational facilities based upon prior or current agreements.
C. The Park and Recreation Board will use due diligence to find playing areas
for all groups that apply for use of Township recreation facilities. However, the
Park and Recreation Board encourages anyone who is considering the formation
of a new organization, or program which would require use of Township fields, to
confer with the Park and Recreation Board before embarking on such an endeavor.
When a request is made for seasonal field use by any group or individual that is not
endorsed by the Park and Recreation Board, the applicant will be instructed to
contact the appropriate organization. If an agreement cannot be reached between
the group and the endorsed organization, the Park and Recreation Board will be
consulted and act as a mediator to reach a compromise, if one shall exist. In the
unlikely event that no compromise can be met, the decision can be appealed to the
Board of Supervisors, which shall have the sole discretion to determine the request.
The decision of the Board of Supervisors shall be final.
D. If a particular group was granted use of a field in the past year, then that
group will be given primary consideration to use the same field in the coming year,
under the following conditions.
(1) An application for field use has been submitted in accordance with the
guidelines set forth.
(2) The proposed use of the field is the same as in the previous year.
(3) The number of participants of the group using the field has not been
substantially changed from the past year.

§16-104 Parks and Recreation §16-106
(4) An existing agreement is in place allowing that group use of said field.
E. Use of Township owned recreation facilities is permissible for any purpose
or use which is public, quasi-public or institutional in nature. For the purpose of
this paragraph, the term “institutional” shall mean a purpose or use by an
organization having a social, educational or religious purpose.
F. Use of Township owned recreation facilities by residents is permissible on
a first come, first served basis. However, organizations which receive authorization
to use the facility by allocation from the Park and Recreation Board have first use
priority. In the event a resident wishes to ensure use of a field or area, the resident
shall contact the Township for the issuance of a facilities use application.
G. The Park and Recreation Board reserves the right to assign recreation
facilities for any special events as it deems necessary provided the requesting group
makes application and pays the required reimbursement expense.
H. Exclusive use of a total park facility will be discouraged. If a request is
made for a total park facility, it will be referred to the Board of Supervisors for
approval after review by the Parks and Recreation Board.

not to exceed $600, plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by

4. Accidental and Slug Discharges.
A. Accidental Discharge and Sludge Discharge Prevention. All users shall
provide and maintain at their own expense facilities adequate, in the judgment of
the Authority, to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited and/or regulated
substances and/or sludge discharges and to protect the public sanitary sewage
system from damages caused by such substances. No industrial user or significant
waste generator which commences discharge to the treatment plant after the
effective date of this Part shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the
treatment plant until the Authority has reviewed and approved that user’s
accidental discharge prevention or sludge prevention procedures (if those
procedures are required by the Authority). Users designated as SIUs after October
14, 2005, must be evaluated for the need for a sludge control discharge plan within
1 year of designation. If the Authority decides a sludge control plan is needed, the
plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: [Ord. 148]
(1) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges.
§18-402 Township of East Pikeland §18-402
18-30
(2) Description of stored chemicals.
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5
(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within 5 days.
(4) If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental
spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and
transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment
measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or
measures and equipment necessary for emergency response.
B. Accidental and/or Slug Discharge Notification. In the case of an accidental
and/or slug discharge to the treatment plant the user shall immediately telephone
and notify the Authority of the accident. The notification shall include information
regarding the location of the discharge, the type of pollutants involved, the
concentration and volume of the discharge and corrective actions taken and/or
contemplated.
C. Accidental and/or Slug Discharge Report. Within 5 working days following
an accidental and/or slug discharge, the user shall submit to the Authority a
detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to
be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the treatment plant, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any
fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this Part or other
applicable law.
D. Employee Notice Concerning Accidental and/or Slug Discharge. A notice
shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place
advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers
shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge
to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
5. Grease and Sand Interceptors.
A. Interceptors Required. Grease, oil and sand interceptors or retainers shall
be installed by the user at his own expense when, in the opinion of the Authority,
such are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, oil
or sand in excessive amounts, and of such other harmful ingredients. Such
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Authority and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning by the user and for
inspection by the Authority.
B. Interceptor Maintenance. Where installed, all grease, oil and sand
interceptors shall be maintained by the user, at his own expense, and shall be kept
in continuous and efficient operation at all times.
6. Hazardous Wastes.
A. General Notification Requirements. All users shall notify in writing EPA,
DEP, the Authority, and the Township of any discharge of a substance whereby if
otherwise disposed of would be hazardous waste (listed or characteristic under
§18-402 Sewers and Sewage Disposal §18-403
18-31
§3001 of RCRA) into the public sanitary sewage system per the requirements of 40
CFR §403.12 (p) (1) through (4).
(Ord. 92, 8/20/2002, §402; as amended by Ord. 148, 10/6/2009, §2; and by Ord. 152,
1/3/2011, §§1, 2)
§18-403. Surcharges and Fees for Certain Wastes.
1. Surcharges.
A. Surcharges Required. Although the sewage treatment works will be
capable of treating certain industrial wastes, the actual treatment of such wastes
may increase the cost of operating and maintaining the public sanitary sewage
system. Therefore, there will be imposed upon each user discharging such waste
into the public sanitary sewage system a surcharge or surcharges which are
intended to cover such additional costs. Such surcharges shall be in addition to
regular sewage service charges and shall be payable as herein provided.
B. Determination of Surcharges. The strength of any industrial or commercial
waste discharge which is to be subject to a surcharge as determined by paragraph
.C of this Section shall be determined quarterly, or more frequently, as the
Authority shall determine. The surcharge shall be determined from samples taken
either at the manhole or metering chamber referred to in this Part, or at any other
sampling point mutually agreed upon by the Authority and the producer of such
waste. The frequency and duration of the sampling period shall be such as, in the
opinion of the Authority, will permit a reasonably reliable determination of the
average composition of such waste, exclusive of stormwater runoff. Samples shall
be collected or their collection supervised by a representative of the Authority and
will be samples that reasonably reflect the characteristics of the waste. Except as
hereinafter provided, the strength of waste so found by analysis shall be used for
establishing the surcharge or surcharges. However, the Authority may, if it so
elects, accept the results of routine sampling and analyses by the producer of such
wastes in lieu of making its own sampling and analyses.
C. Calculation of Surcharges. In the event that, after sampling and analysis
as prescribed in paragraph .B hereof, any industrial or commercial waste is found
by the Authority to have pollutants of BOD concentration in excess of 250
milligrams per liter (mg/L) and/or total suspended solids concentration in excess
of 250 milligrams per liter (mg/L), the producer of said waste shall pay a strength
of waste surcharge in addition to the regular sewage service charge, which
surcharge shall be computed by using the following formula:
S = 0.00834 QI ((BODI - 250) TA + (TSSI - 250) TB)
Where:
S is the surcharge to be added to the basic user charge.
QI is the industrial or commercial waste flow expressed in million gallons.
0.00834 is a constant to convert waste concentration.
BODI and TSSI are the respective concentrations of BOD and total
suspended solids of the industrial or commercial waste expressed in
milligrams per liter (mg/L).
§18-403 Township of East Pikeland §18-404
18-32
250 is a constant which expresses the waste load concentrations of BOD
and total suspended solids for normal domestic strength sewage in
milligrams per liter (mg/L).
TA and TB are actual treatment costs incurred by the Authority per 1,000
pounds of BOD and total suspended solids, respectively. These costs are
determined annually by the Authority based upon actual costs of operation
and maintenance.
When a value of BOD and/or total suspended solids is less than 250 milligrams
per liter (mg/L), than 250 milligrams per liter (mg/L) shall be used in the
calculation of the surcharge.
D. Sampling Fees and Schedules. All industrial or commercial users and all
significant waste generators shall be assessed a fee or service charge for each
sampling to be performed by the Authority. The fees to the user for each sampling
shall include charges, as determined by the Authority, for sample collection,
analysis and administrative services, and shall be in addition to any costs of
sample collection and analysis which the user performs or has performed
independently or privately.
(Ord. 92, 8/20/2002, §403)

enter into agreements with the Authority containing such provisions as the
Authority deems appropriate in furtherance of its effort to comply with regulations
promulgated by the EPA in 40 CFR, Part 403. Industrial users shall comply with
Federal, State and local statutes, ordinance rules and regulations, and with the
provisions of such agreements; and in the event of conflict between provisions, shall
comply with whichever provision on a particular matter is most stringent or more
strict.
7. Pretreatment and Handling of Industrial Wastes.
A. General. Users shall provide necessary pretreatment as required to comply
with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical
pretreatment standards within time limitations as specified in 40 CFR, Part 403,
and amendments thereto. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the Authority shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Authority for review, and shall be acceptable
to the Authority before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures and approval of such plans as required by paragraph .C of
this Section shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Authority under
the provisions of this Part. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities
or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Authority prior
to the user’s initiation of the changes.
B. Purposes and Pretreatment. The Authority may require the owner of an
improved property to construct, operate and maintain at his expense a
pretreatment facility when, in the opinion of the Authority, such facility is
necessary to reduce quantities and/or concentrations of pollutants or flows to:
(1) Decrease the concentration levels of pollutants in the wastewater
discharge to comply with the maximum limits specified in §18-402 of this Part.
§18-404 Township of East Pikeland §18-404
18-38
(2) Prevent excessive quantities of flow.
(3) Prevent discharges (flow or concentration) of pollutants from the user
which may cause interference or pass through at the Authority’s treatment
plant.
C. Review and Approval of Pretreatment Facilities. If required by the
Authority, no pretreatment plant and facilities shall be constructed or operated
unless all plans, specifications, technical operating data, and other information
pertinent to its proposed operation and maintenance are reviewed by the Authority
and found by the Authority to conform to all Authority regulations; and unless
written approval of the plans, specifications, technical operating data and biosolids
disposal methods has been obtained by the Authority from the EPA, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and any other local, State or Federal agency
having regulatory authority with respect thereto, providing such approval is
required by those agencies.
D. Pretreatment Facility Maintenance Requirement. All such pretreatment
facilities as required by this Part shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operating conditions by the user or person operating and maintaining
the facility served thereby, and at the user’s expense. The Township and the
Authority shall have access to such facilities at all reasonable times for purposes
of inspection and testing.
E. Rejection of Waste if Not Adequately Pretreated. The Township and
Authority reserve the right to reject admission to the system of any waste harmful
to the public sanitary sewage system or to the receiving stream, to compel
discontinuance of use of the public sanitary sewage system or to compel
pretreatment of industrial wastes in order to prevent discharges deemed harmful
to or having a deleterious effect upon any portion of the public sanitary sewage
system or receiving stream.
8. Sampling Procedures and Reporting Criteria for Industrial Users Waste
Haulers and Waste Generators.
A. Self-Monitoring Reports.
(1) All significant industrial users shall submit at least twice annually to
the Authority a self-monitoring report on a form approved by the Authority
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the waste discharged
to the Authority treatment plant which are of particular concern to the
Authority and which are limited by this Part. The waste characteristics to be
measured and reported shall be determined by the Authority and specified in
the industrial waste discharge permit or waste permit. All wastewater samples
must be representative of the user’s discharge. In cases where the resolution
requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention
alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the Authority
to determine compliance of the user. If an industrial user monitors any
pollutant more frequently than required by the Authority, using the
procedures prescribed in 40 CFR Part 403.12 (g) (4), the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report. In addition, this report shall include
flow information for the reporting period, and shall be signed by the user’s
responsible individuals. This report shall be received by the Authority no later
§18-404 Sewers and Sewage Disposal §18-404
18-39
than the thirtieth day of the month following the quarter for which the report
is required.
(2) All categorical industrial users and categorical waste generators shall
submit at least twice annually to the Authority a self-monitoring report on a
form approved by the Authority indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the waste discharged to the Authority treatment plant which are
of particular concern to the Authority and which are limited by this Part. The
waste characteristics to be measured and reported shall be determined by the
Authority and specified in the industrial waste discharge permit or waste
permit. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge
and, for all parameters required to be analyzed utilizing a grab sample, a
minimum of one grab sample must be collected and analyzed for each
parameter. In cases where the resolution requires compliance with a best
management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by the Authority to determine compliance of the
user. If a categorical industrial user or categorical waste generator monitors
any pollutant more frequently than required by the Authority, using the
procedures prescribed in 40 CFR Part 403.12 (g) (4), the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report. In addition, this report shall include
flow information for the reporting period, and shall be signed by the user’s
responsible individuals. This report shall be received by the Authority no later
than the thirtieth day of the month following the period for which the report
is required.
(3) All significant waste generators shall submit at least annually to the
Authority a self-monitoring report on a form approved by the Authority
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the waste discharged
to the Authority treatment plant, which are of particular concern to the
Authority and which are limited by this Part. The waste characteristics to be
measured and reported shall be determined by the Authority and specified in
the industrial waste discharge permit or waste permit. All wastewater samples
must be representative of the user’s discharge and, for all parameters required
to be analyzed utilizing a grab sample, a minimum of one grab sample must
be collected and analyzed for each parameter. In cases where the resolution
requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention
alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the Authority
to determine compliance of the user. If a significant waste generator monitors
any pollutant more frequently than required by the Authority, using the
procedures prescribed in 40 CFR Part 403.12 (g) (4), the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report. In addition, this report shall include
flow information for the reporting period, and shall be signed by the user’s
responsible individuals. This report shall be received by the Authority no later
than the thirtieth day of the month following the period for which the report
is required.

belief true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.”
E. Monitoring Manholes. Whenever required by the Township or the
Authority, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying
wastewater and material shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber, flow
metering chamber, flow monitoring equipment, pH monitoring equipment and
other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate the observation, sampling
and measurement of the combined flow of wastes from the user’s premises into the
public sanitary sewage system. These monitoring facilities shall be constructed in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Township or the
Authority and installed and maintained at all times at the user’s expense. There
shall be ample room in each sampling chamber to accurately sample and composite
samples for analysis. The chamber shall be safely and easily and independently (of
other premises and buildings of users) accessible to authorized representatives of
the Township and Authority at all times. When construction of a sampling chamber
and monitoring facilities are not economically or otherwise feasible in the opinion
of the Authority, alternative arrangements for sampling and monitoring may be
made at the discretion of the Authority.
F. Flow Monitoring and Recording. Each flow measuring chamber shall
contain a Parshall flume, weir or similar device with a recording and totalizing
register for measuring liquid quantity, or the metered water supply to the
industrial plant may be used as a measure of liquid quantity where it is
substantiated by the Authority that the metered water supply and waste quantities
are approximately equal or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the
Authority is made in the metered water supply to determine the liquid waste
quantity.
G. Sampling by Authority. Samples shall be taken as deemed appropriate by
the Authority. All significant industrial users shall be sampled by the Authority at
least once per year. Such sampling shall be done as prescribed by the Authority to
insure that the compliance of the user is determined with a reasonable degree of
certainty for the entire reporting period. Samples shall be taken at the manhole or
§18-404 Sewers and Sewage Disposal §18-404
18-41
metering chamber referred to in paragraph .E above, or in the absence of such
manhole or metering chamber, at such place as the Authority shall determine will
provide a representative sample of the discharge and shall represent the entire
flows from the significant industrial user.
H. Inspection and Verification of Sampling and Testing. The sampling
frequency, sampling device, sampling methods, and analyses of samples shall be
subject, at any time, to inspection and verification by the Township or the
Authority.
I. Sampling and Testing Methods. All sampling measurements, tests and
analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined in
accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments
hereto or any other method approved by the EPA.
J. Confidentiality of Information. The Township or Authority shall consider
all information in their possession regarding an industrial user’s or waste
generator’s effluent characteristics as being nonconfidential and may make all such
information available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Township or Authority
that the release of such information in their possession would divulge information
of processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the
user. Upon written request, at the time of submission of the data by the industrial
user or waste generator furnishing a report, permit application or answering a
questionnaire, those portions of any document which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be disclosed to any person other than to duly
authorized representatives of EPA or DEP. Any effluent data of a user’s waste will
not be recognized as confidential information or as a trade secret.
K. Sampling and Testing Costs. When the Authority conducts its own
sampling and/or analyses of wastes discharged by any user, the Authority may
make or have made any such tests, and the user shall reimburse the Authority for
the full cost thereof. Such costs shall be established by resolution annually.
L. 90-Day Compliance Reports. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable national categorical pretreatment standards or, in the
case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the treatment plant, any industrial user or waste generator subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Authority
a report containing the information listed in 40 CFR, Part 403.12 (b)(4) through (6),
indicating the nature and concentration for all pollutants in the discharge from the
regulated process which are limited by the national categorical pretreatment
standards and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the
user facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards. industrial users or
waste generators subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in
accordance with 40 CFR, Part 403.6 (c), must include in the report a reasonable
measure of the user’s long term production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this
report shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. The report shall indicate the compliance status of the user with the
applicable pretreatment standards as listed in 40 CFR §403.12 (b) and (d), whether
§18-404 Township of East Pikeland §18-404
18-42
the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if
not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary
to bring the user into compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards. This
statement shall be signed by the user’s responsible individuals.

determine whether the proposed alteration or conversion of the structure will result
in increased sewage flows.
D. No permit shall be issued for the construction of an alternate sewage
system or an experimental sewage system until the owner shall have supplied the
Township with the name of the person responsible for installing and maintaining
the alternate sewage system or experimental sewage system. All owners of lots
containing an alternate or experimental sewage system shall inform the Township
of any change in ownership of the property or change in the person responsible for
maintaining the alternate or experimental sewage system. The individual
responsible for maintaining the system shall, prior to the issuance of a permit for
construction of an alternate or experimental sewage system, post sufficient security
with the Township to insure the completion of necessary maintenance and repairs.
The amount of the security shall be determined by the Township Engineer, shall
be held by the Township in escrow and shall be used by the Township for
maintenance and necessary repairs only after the responsible person has failed to
perform the maintenance and/or repairs. This provision does not impose any duty
upon the Township to maintain and/or repair an alternate or experimental sewage
system.
2. No person shall install, construct or request bid proposals for construction, or
alter a small flow treatment facility to serve residential dwellings or commercial
facilities generating only domestic wastewater without first obtaining all necessary
permits from the DEP, Health Department, and Sewage Enforcement Officer in
compliance with the Clean Streams Law, the Act, the regulations adopted pursuant to
those Acts, and any other applicable statute or regulation governing such facilities. The
individual responsible for maintaining the facility shall, prior to the issuance of a
permit for construction of a small flow treatment facility post security with the
Township to insure the completion of necessary maintenance and repairs. The escrow
shall be forfeited to the municipality upon notice of continuing noncompliance of the
§18-504 Township of East Pikeland §18-505
18-52
system with the operation, maintenance and monitoring standards contained in the
permit or noncompliance with the assurances for management of the operation and
maintenance requirements established in the maintenance agreement. The forfeited
escrow shall be used to cover the costs of repair or future operation and maintenance
of the system over its design life. The escrow shall be for an amount up to a maximum
of 50 percent for each of the first 2 years of operation. After 2 years of operation, the
escrow agreement must provide for a refund of a portion of the original escrow so that
only 10 percent of the cost of the equipment and installation is retained by the
Township. The remaining escrow totaling 10 percent of the cost of the equipment and
installation shall be maintained for the life of the system. This provision does not
impose any duty upon the Township to maintain and/or repair an alternate or
experimental sewage system.

§24-203. Exemption and Refunds.

sources within the Township is less than $12,000 for any calendar year in which the tax
§24-203 Taxation; Special §24-203
24-9

following persons are exempt from payment of the tax:

A. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax may
annually file an exemption certificate with the Township and with the person’s
employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income
and net profits from all sources within the Township of less than $12,000 in the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the
Township utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption
certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the
Township for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting
to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until
otherwise instructed by the Township or except as required by paragraph .B, the
employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or
the remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available
to employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the
time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided
by the Township.
B. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar
year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the
Township that the person has received earned income and net profits from all
sources within the Township equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year
or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar
year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned income within the
municipality in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year,
an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the person under paragraph
.C.
C. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the
tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under paragraph .B, the
employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The
employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after receipt
§24-203 Township of East Pikeland §24-204
24-10
of the notification under paragraph .B, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that
was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person
under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period.
The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in
that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the
event the employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this
paragraph is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable
for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the Township may pursue collection
under this Part.
D. Except as provided in paragraph .B, it is the intent of this subsection that
employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption certificates,
monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee from the local
services tax.
3. Refunds. East Pikeland Township, in consultation with the collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax paid
by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with
provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and
interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days
after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the
calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be
made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. East Pikeland
Township or the collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds
to exempt persons.
(Ord. 149, 11/30/2009, §1)
§24-204. Duty of Employers to Collect.
1. Each employer within the Township, as well as those employers situated
outside the Township but who engage in business within the Township, is hereby
charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him
or performing for him within the Township and making a return and payment thereof
to the collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each
employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or
commission and whether or not all such services are performed within the Township.
2. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata share
of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The
pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined
by dividing the rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll
periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining
the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a
payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation, except as provided in subsection .4 of this Section. For purposes of this
subsection, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the
school district and the municipality.
3. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by more than
one Township during each payroll period.
§24-204 Taxation; Special §24-207
24-11
4. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal
employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and
the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay
statement is from the employee’s principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within 2 weeks of its
occurrence. The employee’s statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.
5. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year,
irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a person may be
employed. The Township shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request
by the taxpayer.
6. No employer shall he held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the Township if the failure to withhold taxes
arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the employee’s place
or places of employment, the employee’s principal office or where the employee is
principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the local
services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the
employer complies with the provisions of this Part and this Section and remits the
amount so withheld in accordance with this Part.
7. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days after the
end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 149, 11/30/2009, §1)
§24-205. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax on
forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector. If an employer fails to file the
return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes collection thereof from the
salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided
hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in
full as though the tax had been originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 149, 11/30/2009, §1)
§24-206. Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each calendar
quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 149, 11/30/2009, §1)
§24-207. Self-employed Individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or engages
in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment within the
Township shall be required to comply with this Part and pay the pro rata portion of the
tax due to the collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 149, 11/30/2009, §1)
§24-208 Township of East Pikeland §24-210
24-12
§24-208. Individuals Engaged in More than One Occupation or Employed
in More than One Political Subdivision.
The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the person
becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged
in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent employment, or an occupation which
requires the person working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll
period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the following
order:
A. First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed.
B. Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and works if
the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
C. Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and which
imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.
In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year
declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certification
of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 149, 11/30/2009, §1)
§24-209. Nonresidents Subject to Tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places of
business outside of the Township but who perform services of any type or kind or
engage in any occupation or profession within the Township do, by virtue thereof, agree
to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations
promulgated under this Part with the same force and effect as though they were
residents of the Township. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the
Township and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this
Part, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid,
the Township shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or
employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 149, 11/30/2009, §1)
§24-210. Administration of Tax.
1. The collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Township. It shall be the
duty of the collector to accept and receive payments of this tax and to keep a record
thereof showing the amount received by him from each employer of self-employed
person, together with the date the tax was received.
2. The collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement of this
Part and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to municipal approval, to proscribe,
adopt and promulgate rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the

the trust, whether or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically named.
A trust clause which identifies the contingent beneficiaries by reference to the heirs

In interpreting the language of this Ordinance to determine the extent of the restriction upon the use of
the property, the language shall be interpreted, where doubt exists as to the intended meaning of the
language written and enacted by the governing body, in favor of the property owner and against any
implied extension of the restriction. Where the provisions of this Ordinance impose time limitations on
actions by the Township, its Board of Supervisors, its Planning Commission, the Township Engineer
or any other agencies, which time limitations are not required by the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code or other applicable statute, or which are shorter than required by the Pennsylvania

NATURAL FEATURES PROTECTION
Section 400. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the
passage of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to
promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of
Supervisors of East Pikeland Township does hereby order as follows.
2. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of
this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
Article does not imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This Article shall not create liability on the part of East Pikeland Township or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
3. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
This ordinance supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified
floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of
the provisions of this Ordinance, the more restrictive shall apply.
Section 401. FLOODPLAIN CONSERVATION DISTRICT.
1. Statement of Intent. The standards and requirements in this Part are intended to afford
appropriate levels of protection to those natural features within East Pikeland Township that
represent significant resource opportunities to the Township and its surrounding region or which,
when subject to undue disturbance, may constitute threats to public health, safety and welfare.
The Township considers adherence to these standards a basic prerequisite to any subdivision or
land development or disturbance otherwise authorized under this Article or other regulations,
and has designed the balance of this Ordinance to work in harmony with the terms of this Article.
The intent of this Section 401 is to:
A. Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or
minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health and safety by protecting water supply, sanitary sewage

D. Protect the quality and quantity of surface and subsurface water supplies adjacent to and
underlying floodplain areas.
E. Contribute to:
(1) The protection of stream waters against sedimentation;
(2) The prevention of stream bank erosion;
(3) The maintenance of cool water temperatures; and
(4) The preservation of fish and wildlife habitats, through the protection of trees and
other riparian vegetation.
F. Maintain the scenic and aesthetic character of the streams and stream valleys, consistent
with the goals of the East Pikeland Township Comprehensive Plan, and support the
particular objectives of the French Creek Scenic River Guidelines and the designation of
the Schuylkill River within the Scenic Rivers program.
G. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its
residents by preventing the unwise design and construction of development in areas
subject to flooding.
H. Fulfill the responsibility of the Township as a trustee of the people's right to clean air, pure
water, and the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of the
environment pursuant to Article 1, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.
2. Applicability. The Zoning Officer is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this Article and
is referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain Administrator may: (A)

3. Establishment of the Floodplain District. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of
East Pikeland Township, classified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
September 29, 2017 and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the
most recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments are
hereby adopted by East Pikeland Township and declared to be a part of this Article.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway and
which represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by
more than one (1) foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have
been identified in other available studies or sources of information for those Special Flood
Hazard Areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
1. Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
2. Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed,
unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in
the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
1. The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have
been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
2. AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on the FIRM
included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided but no floodway has been determined.
i. No permit shall be granted within any AE Zone without floodway, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed development together with all other
existing and anticipated development, would not result in an increase in flood
levels of more than one foot within the entire community during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
ii. No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured

fifty (50) feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the
appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available,
the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary
of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the municipality. In the absence of any of the above data or
documentation, the community may require elevation of the lowest floor to be at least three
feet above the highest adjacent grade.
D. Special Requirements for Subdivisions and Development
All subdivision proposals and development proposals containing at least 50 lots or at least 5
acres, whichever is the lesser, in Identified Floodplain Areas where base flood elevation data
are not available, shall be supported by hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses that
determine base flood elevations and floodway information. The analyses shall be prepared by
a licensed professional engineer in a format required by FEMA for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision (CLOMR) and Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). Submittal requirements and
processing fees shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
E. The Identified Floodplain Area may be revised or modified by the Board of Supervisors where
studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such
revision. However, prior to any such change to the Special Flood Hazard Area, approval must
be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six (6) months
after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the
changes to the Special Flood Hazard Area by submitting technical or scientific data
4. Boundary Dispute. An initial determination shall be made by the Zoning Officer should a dispute
concerning any district boundary arise. Any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board under the provisions of Article XXII of this Article. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant.
5. Uses Permitted in Floodways .
A. The following uses (exclusive of buildings) are permitted in the Floodway. However, within
any Floodway area, no new construction, development, use, activity or encroachment
shall be permitted unless the effect of such development on flood heights is fully offset by
accompanying stream improvements which have been approved by all appropriate local

in the Floodway by construction of stream improvements, he shall submit an engineering
study, prepared by a Registered Professional Engineer, which fully evaluates the effects of
such construction. The report shall use the Base Flood as herein defined as the basis of
analysis. All adjacent communities and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development shall be notified by the developer by certified mail of all such
intended activities prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and shall submit
copies of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In addition, the
developer shall assure the Township of East Pikeland, in writing, that the flood-carrying
capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse in question will be
maintained.
(1) Agricultural uses, such as: general farming, pasture, orchard, grazing, outdoor plant
nurseries and truck farming. Such activities shall be conducted in accordance with a
plan approved by the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, and recognized soil conservation practices approved by the
Township.
(2) Selective cutting of trees, in accordance with the definition of "selective cutting" in
Section 201 of this Article, and provided further that desirable mature shade trees are
not totally eliminated, that particular attention is paid to retaining such trees within
twenty-five (25') feet of any stream bank, and that no such trees growing within or
upon a stream bank shall be removed unless dead, diseased or damaged and
threatening the stability of the bank.
(3) Recreational uses, such as: park, camp, picnic grounds, golf course, golf driving
range, archery and shooting ranges, hiking and riding trails, hunting and fishing

constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages.
11. Minimum Flood-proofing Standards. Where a Special Exception has been requested under the
provisions of Subsection 8, above, in which it is anticipated that a structure or use will be
modified, altered, repaired, reconstructed, expanded or improved in any way, when a sewage
treatment plant or pumping station is contemplated under the provisions of Subsection 6, above,
or where a Special Exception or Variance is granted under the provisions of Subsection 12,
below, the following minimum standards shall apply to flood-proofing:
A. Within any Floodway , AE Areas or A Areas, the lowest floor (including basement) of any
new or improved residential structure shall be above the Regulatory Flood Elevation or, in
the case of non-residential structures, the structure, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, shall be designed so that below the Regulatory Flood Elevation the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy. Any non-residential structure, or part thereof, made
watertight below the Regulatory Flood Elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with
the W1 or W2 space classification standards contained in the publication entitled "Flood-
Proofing Regulations" published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (June 1972, as
amended March 1992) or with some other equivalent standard. All plans and
specifications for such floodproofing shall be accompanied by a statement certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect which states that the proposed design and
methods of construction are in conformance with the above referenced standards. There
should be a statement submitted with the permit application and a statement submitted
with the as-built Floodproofing Certificate prior to the issuance of the Certificate of
Occupancy.
B. If fill is used to raise the finished surface of the lowest floor to the Regulatory Flood
Elevation, such fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to provide
acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line from all points. For non-residential structures, fill shall be placed to
provide access acceptable for intended use. At-grade access, with fill extending laterally
fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line, shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
C. All buildings and structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted
engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement, thus reducing
the threat to life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
D. Space below the lowest floor.
(1) Fully enclosed space below the lowest floor (including basement) is prohibited.
(2) Partially enclosed space below the lowest floor (including basement) which will be
used solely for the parking of a vehicle, building access, or incidental storage in an

Section 402. STEEP SLOPE CONSERVATION DISTRICT.
1. Intended Purposes of this Section 402 are as follows:
A. To promote the public health, safety and welfare by the protection of steep slope areas and
by encouraging the retention of open space located and designed so as to constitute a
harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of East Pikeland Township.
B. To permit only those uses of steep slope areas that are compatible with the conservation
of natural conditions and which maintain stable soil conditions by
(1) Minimizing disturbances to vegetative ground covers; and
(2) Restricting the re-grading of steep slope areas.
C. To limit soil erosion and the resultant destruction of the land, siltation of streams and
damage to the property of individuals.
D. To protect low lying areas from flooding by limiting the increase in stormwater runoff
caused by grading of sloped areas, changes of ground cover or the erection of structures.
E. To maintain the ecological integrity and habitat value of steeply sloped areas, i.e.,
indigenous vegetation and wildlife, which could be adversely affected by otherwise
permitted disturbances.
F. To allow the continuing replenishment of groundwater resources and the maintenance of
springs.
2. General Provisions.
A. Compliance. No area within the Steep Slope Conservation District shall hereafter be used
without full compliance with the terms of this Section 402 and other applicable regulations.
B. Steep Slope Conservation District Overlay Concept. The Steep Slope Conservation
District shall be deemed an overlay on any zoning district(s) now or hereafter enacted to
regulate the use of land in East Pikeland Township.
(1) The Steep Slope Conservation District shall have no effect on the permitted uses in
the underlying zoning district, except where said uses are intended to be located
within the boundaries of the Steep Slope Conservation District, as defined herein,
and said uses are in conflict with the permitted uses set forth in this Section 402.
(2) In those areas of the Township where the Steep Slope Conservation District applies,
the requirements of the Steep Slope Conservation District shall supersede the
requirements of the underlying zoning district(s).
(3) Should the Steep Slope Conservation District boundaries be changed as a result of legislative
or administrative actions or judicial decision, the zoning requirements applicable to the area in
East Pikeland Township
Zoning Ordinance
Article IV
Natural Features Protection
Enacted December 17, 2002
Last Amended June 6, 2017

question shall revert to the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s) without
consideration of this Section 402.
(4) For any parcel or any part thereof on which the Steep Slope Conservation District is
an overlay, should the underlying zoning classification(s) be changed as a result of
legislative or administrative actions or Judicial decision, such change(s) in
classification shall have no effect on the boundaries of the Steep Slope Conservation
District, unless an amendment to said boundaries was included as part of the
proceedings from which the subsequent change(s) originated.
C. Preservation of Other Restrictions. It is not intended by this Section 402 to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However,
where this Section 402 imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Section 402 shall
prevail.
D. Municipal Liability. Any determination that a proposed use complies with this Article, or
any approval of a subdivision or land development plan, or any issuance of a building
permit within or near the Steep Slope Conservation District shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee or warranty of any kind by the Township, or by any official or employee
thereof, of the practicability or safety of the proposed use and shall create no liability upon
the Township, its officials or employees. This Article does not imply that areas outside the
Steep Slope Conservation District boundaries or land uses permitted within said District
will always be totally free from the adverse effects of erosion, or other effects of nearby
steep slopes.
3. Designation and Interpretation of District Boundary.
A. The Steep Slope Conservation District consists of two (2) areas, delineated and defined
below. The Zoning Map Overlay constitutes only a general representation of the Steep
Slope Conservation District, based on the analysis of the contours displayed on the United
States Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangles from Malvern and Phoenixville,
Pennsylvania. As such, refined mapping will be required to more accurately define the
District, as specified in Section 402.3.B, herein.
(1) Prohibitive Slope - Prohibitive slopes are those characterized by a change in
elevation greater than twenty-five percent (25%) over a distance or contour specified
in Section 402.3.B herein.
(2) Precautionary Slope - Precautionary slopes are those characterized by a change in
elevation from fifteen percent (15%) to twenty-five percent (25%) over a distance or
contour specified in Section 402.3.B, herein.
B. Boundary Interpretation and Appeals Procedure.
(1) Each application for construction or land disturbance within the Steep Slope
Conservation District shall be submitted in accordance with Section 402.5.A, below.
Any area of the Steep Slope Conservation District that falls within the subject lot or
lots shall be shown on the site plan required under Section 402.5.A (1) through
East Pikeland Township

shading of such area or areas. The Zoning Map Overlay shall be used as a general
guide for determining the boundaries of the District. In any application for subdivision
and/or land development, the applicant shall, using two (2) foot contours, delineate
slopes from fifteen to twenty-five percent (15%-25%) and greater than or equal to
twenty-five percent (25%). Further, the applicant shall use an actual field topographic
survey as the source of contour information as required in the East Pikeland
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
(2) The representative sample of a precautionary slope or prohibitive slope shall be
based on a cumulative change in grade of six (6) feet or more. Therefore, all steep
and very steep slope areas shall be shown, but only those occurring over three (3)
consecutive two (2) foot contour intervals will invoke the use restrictions set forth
below.
(3) The mapping delineated the applicant will be reviewed by the Planning Commission
and Township Engineer. The applicant will be required to follow all regulations of this
Article for those areas which reflect steep slope and very steep slope conditions as
determined through the Planning Commission's or Township Engineer's review.
(4) An initial determination shall be made by the Township Engineer in such cases
requiring an interpretation of the exact location of the District boundaries in relation to
a given parcel. Any party seeking such a determination may submit a topographic
survey of the property and any other pertinent documentation for consideration. The
Township Engineer shall make a written report of the results of his initial
determination, a copy of which shall be provided to the Board of Supervisors.
(5) Any party aggrieved by such determination of the Township Engineer or other
decision or determination under this Section 402 may appeal to the Zoning Hearing
Board. The party contesting the location of the District boundary shall have the
burden of proof in case of any such appeal.
4. Permitted Uses.
A. Standards Applicable to All Uses within the Steep Slope Conservation District.
(1) All grading shall be minimized, and no grading shall be undertaken within any area of
the Steep Slope Conservation District except where approved in conjunction with a
use permitted under the terms of this Section 402.

adoption of this Section 402, any use or structure which is situated within the boundaries of the
Steep Slope Conservation District and which does not conform to the permitted uses specified in
Subsection 402.4, above, shall become a nonconforming use or structure, regardless of its
conformance to the base zoning district in which it is located without consideration of this
Section 402. The expansion or continuance of said nonconforming use or structure shall be
governed by the requirements of Article XXI of this Article. However, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall also ensure that the standards contained in Subsection 5.B, above, are applied to the
expansion or continuance of said nonconforming use or structure.
Section 403. SOILS WITH SEASONALLY HIGH WATER TABLE AND WETLANDS
1. Seasonally High Water Table Soils
A. Soils with seasonally high water tables, as defined in Article II, shall not be disturbed by the
construction of any structure or any subsurface sewage system.
B. Where soils with a seasonally high water table exist, no proposed structure shall be less
than fifty (50) feet from the established boundary of such soils. No land disturbance,
including grading or the creation of stormwater management facilities, shall be permitted in
areas containing seasonally high water table soils.
C. In order to delineate seasonally high water table soils, soil investigation must be observed
in the field by the Township Engineer. Test pits shall be excavated at fifty (50) foot intervals
along the length of the seasonally high water table soils boundary both within and outside
of the seasonally high water table soils. A written soil log shall be required for each test pit.
A map shall be required showing the surveyed location of each test pit as well as an
identification number. A written report, prepared by a qualified professional, compiling the
written logs, mapping and a summary of the delineated seasonally high water table soils
area, shall also be required. The Township Engineer shall review the report to determine
compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and other applicable ordinances and issue a review
letter to the Township.
2. Wetlands. Wetlands shall be determined to exist where indicated by the use of the Criteria for
Wetland Identification as outlined in the Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating
Jurisdictional Wetlands as adopted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection. Where wetlands are found to exist, the following procedures are applicable:
A. Should the existence of wetlands be indicated after a review of the requirements of Section
403.2 above, a wetlands delineation shall be performed by a licensed professional
engineer, hydrogeologist, soil scientist, or similarly qualified professional experienced in
wetland ecology, with the selection of such party to be at the discretion of the applicant.
Plans shall be submitted to the Township for review that show the delineation and indicate
any disturbance of wetlands anticipated. The qualifications of the consultant performing the
delineation shall be submitted with such plans. Further, unless it is clearly evident in such
plans and/or by any field review of the Township Engineer that there are no designated
wetlands or, if there are, that no disturbance to the designated wetlands is anticipated, the
East Pikeland Township
Zoning Ordinance
Article IV
Natural Features Protection
Enacted December 17, 2002
Last Amended June 6, 2017

delineation performed shall be submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies, including,
but not limited to, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection for boundary confirmation and/or requisite wetland permits. All
potential impact on wetlands shall conform to applicable regulations, as amended.
B. Should the Township conclude, after reviewing the information to be determined under
Section 403.1 and 403.2, that wetlands exist, or exist to a greater extent on the site,
contrary to the applicants’ findings, the Township may engage a separate consultant or an
independent consultant to review the data and make such examinations in the field as are
required to verify or determine the extent of discrepancy from the applicant’s wetland
determinations. In the event the Township finds the applicant’s determination to be
incorrect, the applicant shall be required to pay for the cost of the Township’s
determinations in this regard. In the event that the applicant’s wetland determinations are
found to be correct, the Township will bear the cost of the verification survey indicated.
C. Where wetlands exist and disturbance permits and/or mitigation activities are required,
final plan approval or granting of applicable permits from the Township shall be contingent
upon the applicant receiving all necessary wetlands permits, and/or waivers permits. Such
permitting shall include, as required by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, a habitat screening for the potential presence of bog turtles or other
endangered species or their habitat as designated by any state or federal entity.
SECTION 404. CONSERVATION OF WOODLANDS AND OTHER VEGETATION
1. The purpose of this Section is to conserve and protect existing woodlands in the Township and
to mitigate the removal of woodlands due to land development practices. The value of
woodlands to the Township is both aesthetic and functional. The rural character of the Township
is largely due to the presence of extensive woodlands, hedgerows and cultivated vegetation.
The vegetation provides soil stability by preventing erosion from stormwater and dissipating
rainfall. Habitat for wildlife is provided where significant stands of trees and shrubs are allowed
to remain in a natural state.
2. Disturbance of Woodlands and Hedgerows
A. Unless conducted as an approved timber harvesting operation in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1823, no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of woodlands and
hedgerows shall be disturbed. Where woodlands and hedgerows overlap other protected
resources, the more restrictive standard shall apply. Woodlands and hedgerows shall be
considered a single resource in the calculation of the permitted degree of disturbance.
Woodland disturbance includes the following:
1. Any activity that alters the existing structure of woodland or hedgerow. Alterations
include the cutting or removal of canopy trees, sub-canopy trees, under-story shrubs
and vines, woody and herbaceous species; and
2. Any activity that constitutes a land disturbance (exposes soils, alters topography) within

B. Unless specifically exempted by this Article, no tree shall be cut or otherwise removed from
any land within the Township unless a tree removal permit has been secured in
accordance with the provisions of Section 404.7.B, Exemptions.
C. Permitted woodland disturbance shall be based on plan measurements of the extent of
tree canopy removal and not on measurement of trunk diameters of trees before and after
clearing.
D. Woodland disturbance does not include management by means of the selective cutting or
removal of invasive alien trees, shrubs, vines or herbaceous species as identified by the
Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (PADCNR) or other
authority recognized by the Township.
3. Protection of Specimen Vegetation. Specimen vegetation, as defined herein, shall not be
removed from any lot or tract except where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Township that such removal is essential to eliminate a hazardous condition(s) or there is a
demonstrable financial hardship if the vegetation is not removed. Where permitted, removal of
specimen vegetation shall be minimized.
4. Guidelines for Permitted Woodland Disturbance. In determining where permitted woodland
disturbance will occur, the following factors shall be considered:
A. The applicant shall consider the location(s) and benefits of the conservation of mature,
healthy woodland stands and their importance as wildlife habitat.
B. Each building or structure shall be constructed in such a manner as to provide the least
alteration necessary of the existing woodland. Where possible, the amount of clear-cutting
shall be minimized and trees shall be selectively removed.
C. Trees which are retained shall be identified and protected in accordance with the
provisions of Section 404.5.
D. Woodland disturbance that would threaten the growth of remaining trees shall be avoided.
E. Woodlands and other natural vegetation that remain undisturbed shall interconnect with
woodlands or wooded areas of adjacent properties, where they exist, to preserve
continuous woodland corridors and allow for the normal movement, dispersion, and
migration of wildlife. The applicant shall consider the impacts, in terms of functions and
values to wildlife, of separating, dividing, or encroaching on wildlife travel corridors or
extensive habitat areas, especially woodlands exceeding ten (10) acres in area.
5. Tree Protection Zone. In order to prevent injury to those trees which have been designated for
protection, a Tree Protection Zone shall be established, prior to any land disturbance, where
trees or woodlands on the site are to be retained. In the Tree Protection Zone, the following
standards shall apply:
East Pikeland Township
Zoning Ordinance
Article IV

stored either temporarily or permanently in the Tree Protection Zone. Vehicles and
equipment shall not be parked in the Tree Protection Zone.
E. Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not be located within the Tree Protection
Zone, nor shall they discharge into the Tree Protection Zone.
F. When tree stumps are located within ten (10) feet of the tree protection zone, the stumps
shall only be removed by means of a stump grinder to minimize the effect on the
surrounding root systems.
G. Tree roots which must be severed shall be cut by a backhoe or similar equipment aligned
radially to the tree.
H. Within four (4) hours of any severance of roots, all tree roots that have been exposed
and/or damaged shall be trimmed cleanly and covered temporarily with moist peat moss,
moist burlap or other biodegradable material to keep them from drying out until permanent
cover can be installed.
I. Where a utility line must be located through a tree protection zone, tunneling shall be used
instead of trenching, except where, in the opinion of the Township, survival of the tree
would not be affected by either method. The Township shall determine the most desirable
location for the utility line. Trenches shall be filled as soon as possible, and tamped lightly to
avoid air spaces.
J. Marking the Tree Protection Zone on the Site
Prior to construction, the Tree Protection Zone shall be delineated by the following
methods:
(1) The Tree Protection Zone that is delineated on the site prior to construction shall
conform to the approved development plans.
(2) All trees scheduled to remain shall be marked; where groups of trees exist, only the
trees on the edge need to be marked.
(3) A suitable fence mounted on steel posts, located eight feet on center, shall be placed
along the boundary of the Tree Protection Zone. The fencing along the zone shall be
maintained until all construction and other work has been completed. Any damage to
the protective fencing shall be replaced and repaired before further construction

commences.
(4) In addition to the tree protection zone, trees may be left standing as protection
between the trunks of the trees to be retained and the limits of grading. When
additional trees are used as protection, the tree protection zone on the approved plan
shall be marked in the field so that the additional buffer area is delineated. When this
method of protection is used, these additional trees shall be removed at the time of
completion of the project.
K. Where a tree designated for preservation is severely damaged by construction (or is
clearly not going to survive) within one (1) year of the end date of construction, tree
replacement shall occur as provided for in Section 404.6.
6. Tree Replacement.

existing woodland for each principal use permitted on a lot or tract.
b. Woodland disturbance in excess of fifty percent (50%) on any single lot within a
subdivision.
(2) In determining the extent of the woodland disturbance, it shall include the entire area
within the drip line of any tree comprising a wooded area, where any portion of the
drip line of such tree is subject to disturbance.
(3) Tree replacement shall not be required for invasive species as identified by the
Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (PADCNR) or
other authority recognized by the Township.

For example, if a revitalization tract has 10 total gross acres, and assuming that 65%
of the tract is allocated for residential use and 35% of the tract is allocated for
commercial use or mixed-use, then the following densities shall be permitted on the
tract:

bedroom townhouses and 16 two bedroom townhouses), or
(c) 10 gross acres x 65% x 12 units/acre = 78 stacked townhouse units (78 two
bedroom stacked townhouses), or
(d) The 6.5 residential acres may be proportionally allocated among the three
permitted multi-family unit types at their respective allowable densities.

this Ordinance, and subject to any and all applicable state or federal environmental or
other applicable regulatory standards or permits, an applicant shall, during the land
development review process, employ any combination of berming, grading,
landscaping or planting, which is necessary to provide for a visual screen that
effectively mitigates the offsite visual impact of the Electric utility facility uses on
adjacent residential uses, and which integrates with the natural features of the site.
At a minimum, the visual impact mitigation plan shall incorporate landscape berms of
at least thirty (30) feet in height to screen the impact of an electric utility facility use.
The berms shall be designed with a tree-planting plan to provide additional yearround
buffering. The height of the berms, in whole or in part, may be reduced to no
less than Twenty (20) feet with the approval of the Township Board of Supervisors,
where the Applicant proposes a foot-for-foot reduction in the height of the buildings
and structures by lowering the elevation of the buildings and structures below the
natural grade, or where the Township Board of Supervisors finds that construction of
the berms, in whole or in part, is not feasible. Should the Township Board of
Supervisors find that the berming, in whole or in
part, will not adequately mitigate the visual impact, or in any case where a berm of
less than thirty (30) feet is proposed, the Applicant shall also propose and submit a
detailed viewshed analysis of the impact of an electric utility facility use from such
vantage points as may be determined by the Township to require further mitigation,
accompanied by a detailed mitigation plan for each identified viewshed,
demonstrating that following implementation of the enhanced viewshed impact
mitigation plan, no greater than thirty percent (30%) of the relevant elevation of an
electric utility facility use shall be visible from the said vantage point. The enhanced
visual impact mitigation plan shall be designed by a certified landscape architect, and
shall be subject to the review and approval of the Township.

Section 1604 OBTAINING BUILDING PERMITS FOR THE ALTERATION, CONSTRUCTION,
DEMOLITION AND DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT OF OR IMPACTING HISTORIC
RESOURCES
The following requirements shall apply to obtaining a building permit for a Historic Resource or
property on which it is located. If a Building Permit is not required under the Uniform Construction
Code, historic review is still required under this Article.
1. Applicability of requirements for obtaining a Building Permit. No Historic Resource may be
demolished, in whole or in part, whether deliberately or by neglect, including the removal,
stripping, concealing, or destruction of any significant exterior architectural features; no new
additions or expansions to the Historic Resource; no construction or reconstruction can take
place on a property containing a Historic Resource, unless a building permit is obtained from
the Zoning Officer in accordance with the procedures and requirements of this Article.
2. Special Provisions are found in the following sections: Alterations and Construction of or on
Historic Resources (§1605); Demolition of Historic Resources (§1606); Demolition by Neglect
(§1607); and Properties within Certified Historic Districts (§1608).
3. The following exceptions or considerations may apply for resources outside of Certified
Historic Districts (CHDs):
A. In-kind Maintenance and Repair. These provisions shall not be construed to prevent
the ordinary maintenance or repair of any Historic Resource where such work does not
otherwise require a permit and where the purpose and effect of such work are to
correct any deterioration or decay of, or damage to, a Historic Resource and to restore
the same to its condition prior to the occurrence of such deterioration, decay, or
damage. The Zoning Officer shall interpret “in-kind” as being substantially similar, if not
identical, to the historic design and fabric at the time of the application.
B. Emergency Repairs. In case of emergency, such as storm or fire damage, the Zoning
Officer may approve a building permit for temporary measures to stabilize or secure a
Historic Resource. To qualify for this exception, the Applicant must demonstrate that
the work will be “reversible” (i.e., can be removed without altering or damaging the
Historic Resource and will not further damage the Historic Resource). As applied to this
section, “temporary” means not more than one (1) year from the start of construction.
The Zoning Officer may approve one extension of not more than of six months.
C. The Historical Commission shall limit review to exteriors of Historic Resources.
D. Non-Historic Outbuildings: The Historical Commission may give consideration in the
form of relief to otherwise applicable sections of this Article for resources that do not
contribute to the historical or architectural significance of the property, such that
alterations to or demolition of these resources do not adversely impact the Historic
Resource(s) on the property or Historic Resources on adjacent properties.

4. Building Permit Application Procedure: For all building permits, including those for demolition,
alteration or construction, the Zoning Officer shall receive application and ensure it is
complete. It is the responsibility of the property owner or agent to determine if the property is a
Historic Resource. Any application submitted to the Zoning Officer for a building permit shall
be reviewed to determine if the property is a Historic Resource, and/or whether the property is
located within a CHD. Once complete and not exempt (see 3.A-D above), the Zoning Officer
will forward the application to the Historical Commission, or where the Historic Resource in a
CHD, the HARB, within five (5) days. Within forty-five (45) days, the Commission or HARB will
meet at its regularly scheduled or special meeting to consider the application. The completed
application must arrive to the Commission no less than ten (10) days before the meeting. The
Applicant will be notified of the meeting time and date no less than ten (10) days before the
meeting, unless otherwise agreed.
5. Informal Meeting: Prior to the formal permit application process (see above), the applicant is
welcome to appear before the Historical Commission or HARB to discuss the project.
6. Communication. The Zoning Officer shall provide monthly reports to the Historical
Commission and HARB addressing any activity or actions by the Zoning Officer regarding
Historic Resources outside or within a CHD, and specifically address decisions by the Zoning
Officer regarding exceptions found in 3A-D above.
7. Violations and Penalties. Any person who demolishes a Historic Resource in violation of the
provisions of §1604 - §1608 shall be subject to enforcement under Article XXV of the Zoning
Ordinance. The Township may also place an additional fine on the property owner that equals
the market value of the demolished or destroyed property. Said fine shall be used for the
historic preservation purposes as determined appropriate by the Township.
8. In the event the Board of Supervisors authorizes the commencement of an action pursuant to
§1604 – §1608 of this Article, the Zoning Officer shall issue no building permit for a minimum
of five (5) years for any construction proposed for a property containing or having contained a
Historic Resource that was altered or demolished in violation of this Article, unless issued for
the purpose of restoring the Historic Resource to its condition and appearance immediately
prior to the violation.
9. In addition to the above remedies, the Township may take other appropriate legal action,
which may include equitable and injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of §1604-§1608 of

Section 1609 STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION AND GENERAL DESIGN GUIDELINES
1. Standards for Rehabilitation (as adopted from the [U.S.] Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for Rehabilitation, 1977 and last amended 1990.). Any proposed rehabilitation, alteration, or
enlargement of a Historic Resource shall be in substantial compliance with the Standards set
forth below:
A. A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires
minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.
East Pikeland Township
Zoning Ordinance
Article XVI
Historic Resource Protection
Enacted December 17, 2002
Last Amended June 2, 2015 XVI - 17
B. The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of
distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that
characterize a property will be avoided.
C. Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use.
Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding
conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken.
D. Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be
retained and preserved.
E. Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of
craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.
F. Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity
of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match
the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of
missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
G. Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest
means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.
H. Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources
must be disturbed, documentation and mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
I. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic
materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic
materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of
the property and its environment.
J. New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a
manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic
property and its environment would be unimpaired.
2. General Design Guidelines. The following design guidelines are meant to serve as guidance
for new construction and alteration to Historic Resources. Consideration shall be given to:
A. The effect of the proposed change upon the general historical and architectural nature
of the Historic Resource, adjacent Historic Resources or CHD.
B. Where applicable, the general design, arrangement, texture and material of a Historic
Resource and the relation of such factors to similar features of adjacent Historic
Resources and/or those within a CHD.
C. Special consideration shall be given to the following:

This Article contains certain general regulations and design standards that are common to all zoning
districts unless stated as pertinent to a specific district herein.
Section 1701. PROJECTIONS INTO REQUIRED YARDS
Projections into required yard areas shall be permitted in all zoning districts in accordance with the
following provisions:
1. Open fire escapes, unroofed porches, chimneys and bay windows may project a maximum of
four (4) feet into any side or rear yard.
2. Awnings or movable canopies may project into any yard a maximum of twelve (12) feet,
provided they extend no closer than fifteen (15) feet from the property line.
3. Arbors, open trellises, unroofed steps or terraces, decks, and similar uninhabitable accessory
structures and projecting flagpoles shall be permitted within side and rear yard areas provided
that they are not more than twelve (12) feet in height and are set back a minimum of ten (10)
feet from the lot line.
Section 1702. This section deleted per Ordinance No. 141, adopted December 16, 2008
Section 1703. HEIGHT LIMITATIONS OF FENCES AND WALLS
Except for the requirements of Section 1819, pertaining to junkyards, no fence or wall (except a
retaining wall or a wall of a building permitted under the provisions of this Ordinance) over six (6) feet
in height shall be erected within any required yard area unless that portion of the fence or wall that
exceeds six (6) feet in height has a ratio of open area to solid area of a minimum of four to one (4:1).
Section 1704. EXEMPTIONS TO HEIGHT RESTRICTION
The height limitations of this Ordinance shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, ventilators,
HVAC equipment, water towers, parapet walls less than six feet in height, elevators, flagpoles or other
appurtenances usually located above the roof of a building or structure and not intended for human
occupancy. The total height of such structures shall be no greater than the smallest horizontal
distance between any facade of the structure and the property line closest thereto. When authorized
by the Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception, an increase to this maximum height limit may be
permitted where it is demonstrated that the structure incorporates safety features, which, in the event
the structure is toppled, will prevent it from falling beyond the boundaries of the property. Additionally,

Other Uses. The Board of Supervisors shall determine with which of the preceding categories of
parking regulation any unlisted use shall comply or may designate a standard for a use that
does not conform to the preceding categories.
6. Shared Parking. A reduction in the required number of parking spaces is permitted when there
will be a sharing of parking spaces by uses with different periods of peak parking demand. In
such cases, the applicant shall provide justification for reduced parking based upon Urban Land
Institute (ULI) standards for shared parking as set forth in its publication Shared Parking, most
recent edition, shared parking standards of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or
other authoritative source as acceptable to the Township. This analysis shall include a
submission of calculations indicating that available parking will be sufficient during peak demand
periods for parking. Approval of such shared parking may be rescinded by the Board of
Supervisors and additional parking obtained by the owners in the event that the Board
determines that the joint use of parking facilities is resulting in a public nuisance or otherwise
adversely affecting the public health, safety or welfare.
7. Parking Reserve Area. The number of parking spaces to be constructed may be up to twentyfive
percent (25%) less than the number required herein only when the following conditions are
met to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors:
A. Evidence is submitted firmly documenting that the special nature of the proposed
occupancy or use of the building requires less parking area or spaces than required by
Section 1707.5.
B. The land development plan submitted by the Applicant indicates that the location and
layout of that portion of the required parking or loading area deemed unnecessary at the
time of the application can and will be constructed on the site, according to the
requirements of this Section 1707, during the first six (6) years following full development
of the lot. If, at the end of the sixth (6th) year following full the development of the approved
plan, the parking reserve area or any part thereof has not been developed as an additional
parking area, the Applicant or the then present landowner may petition the Board of
Supervisors for permission to develop or otherwise utilize the parking reserve area in
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, if the Board of Supervisors determines
that this parking or loading is not necessary to the interest of the public health, safety or
welfare.
C. In no event shall that authorized portion of the required parking area that is not to be
constructed, but reserved for possible future use, be counted as open space or other nonpaved
area required by other provisions of this Ordinance.
D. The parking reserve area shall be designed so that any required minimum area of
vegetative cover would be maintained in the event that the parking reserve area is
subsequently developed.
E. The parking reserve area shall be landscaped according to an approved plan and the
provisions of Section 1709.
F. The parking reserve area shall have no building, whether temporary or permanent, erected
on it at any time.

8. Pervious Parking. Pervious parking surfaces are encouraged in order to protect surface and
ground water resources, and may be constructed using porous asphalt or concrete, concrete
pavers, polymer-based grass pavers, grids, or geocells.
A. Where testing demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer that stormwater
will be infiltrated from pervious parking surfaces at a rate at least equal to pre-development
good meadow conditions, such areas will not be considered impervious in determining
allowable lot development. However, applicants shall comply with the Township’s Act 167
Stormwater Management Ordinance.
B. Parking that is necessary only to accommodate seasonal peak demands, as opposed to
daily or weekly peak demands, shall be pervious when soils have adequately permeability
and where groundwater quality is protected.
9. Special Exception or Conditional Use. For any use permitted by special exception or conditional
use, it shall be the burden of the applicant to present evidence of the parking needs of the
proposed use. The Zoning Hearing Board, in granting a special exception, or the Board of
Supervisors in granting conditional use approval, may attach specific parking requirements that
vary from the requirements of this Article where the Board of Supervisors makes a decision
using the Conditional Use criteria set forth in Section 2000.6 or the Zoning Hearing Board uses
the Special Exception criteria set forth in Section 2208.
10. Parking in the Kimberton Historic District. Parking in the Kimberton Historic District, as defined
on the map titled “East Pikeland Township Cultural, Historical and Architectural Resources Map”
shall comply with the provisions of Section 1707, Parking Standards, unless otherwise approved
by the Board of Supervisors. The Kimberton Historic District is located within the Kimberton
Retail Zoning District and it is the intent to provide opportunities for redevelopment of
underutilized or otherwise blighted properties consistent with the historic nature of the Kimberton
Village. The Board of Supervisors shall consider the following when reviewing a request.
A. Comments from the Township Historic Commission.
B. The impact of the proposed use on public health, safety and welfare.
C. The ability of Emergency Service vehicles to access the site.
D. The impact of the use on adjacent property owners.
E. Up to 50% of the required number of parking spaces may be provided offsite provided,
however, that written agreement assuring the retention for such purpose shall be properly
drawn and executed by the parties concerned and approved as to form and execution by
the Township Solicitor. Such an agreement shall be filed and made part of the application
for a building permit. Approval of such shared parking may be rescinded by the Board of
Supervisors and additional parking obtained by the owners in the event that the Board
determines that the joint use of parking facilities is resulting in a public nuisance or
otherwise adversely affecting the public health, safety and welfare.

E. Because of the benefits of planting native plants (price, longevity, wildlife habitat), the
applicant is urged to conform to the minimum planting guidelines in Table 1 through the
use of native trees and shrubs. Recommended native trees are found in Appendix E of the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
F. Species selected by the Applicant should reflect the following considerations:
(1) Existing site conditions and suitability for the plant materials, based upon the site
geology, hydrology, soils, and microclimate.
(2) Specific functional objectives of the plantings, which may include, but not necessarily
be limited to, visual screening, noise abatement, energy conservation, wildlife
habitats, and aesthetic values.
(3) Maintenance and replacement considerations such as hardiness, resistance to
insects and disease, longevity, and availability of plant materials.
G. For the purpose of promoting disease resistance, minimum maintenance, diverse natural
plant associations, and long-term stability of plantings, the applicant is encouraged to
choose those combinations of species which may be expected to be found together under
natural conditions.
H. Plantings and their measurement shall conform to the standards of the publication
“American or U.S.A Standard for Nursery Stock”, ANSI or U.S.A.S. Z60.1 of the American
Association of Nurserymen, as amended. All plant material used on site shall have been

impacts of the proposed site disturbance.
B. Planting areas should be selected and designed to reflect natural landscape characteristics
existing prior to site disturbance, as well as those environmental conditions to be created
following disturbance by the applicant.
C. The locations, dimensions, and spacing of required plantings should be adequate for
proper growth and maintenance, taking into account the sizes of such plantings at maturity
and present and future environmental requirements, such as moisture and sunlight.
D. All landscape plans shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of Section 404 of
this Ordinance regarding the conservation of woodlands. Applicants shall make all
reasonable efforts to harmonize landscape plans with the conservation of the existing
vegetation and natural features of the site. Care shall be taken to protect remaining
vegetation from damage during site disturbance and construction.
5. Visual Impact Plan. For all activities identified in Section 1709.1, above, the applicant shall
submit a plan that includes provisions for impact mitigation and tong-term maintenance, as
follows:
A. Depiction on the property base map of all mitigation measures proposed by the applicant,
including number and placement of plantings and of other landscape or design
improvements as specified in Section 1709.2.
B. Delineation of the Applicant’s property as it would be developed, as seen from adjoining
properties used or zoned for residential or institutional purposes, and from existing
adjoining public roads. Such views shall be classified according to whether views of the
applicant’s proposed improvements would be hidden, filtered, or obstructed. With respect
to adjoining roads, such views shall be based on the viewer’s location at the far edge of the
road cartway, the opposite edge of which directly abuts the property. With respect to
adjoining properties, the viewer’s location shall be along the lines established by the
minimum front, side, and rear yard distances as required by existing zoning for those
properties.
C. A delineation of views of the Applicant’s property as seen at the time of the applicant’s
mitigation improvements in place.
D. Documentation demonstrating the extent to which the landscape planting and design
measures conform to the guidelines in the Minimum Planting Guidelines, Table 1. Where
they do not conform, the applicant shall demonstrate one (1) or more of the following:
(1) That other mitigation measures chosen will produce comparable or superior results;
(2) That, through design excellence in site planning, landscape architecture, and/or
architecture, the guidelines in the Minimum Planting Guidelines Table, would be
unnecessary or inappropriate;
(3) That the need to mitigate in accordance with the guidelines constitutes an
unreasonable or unnecessary financial burden.

Design Standards
Enacted December 17, 2002
Last Amended July 11, 2017 XVII - 23
(2) For lighting horizontal tasks such as roadways, sidewalks, entrances and parking
areas, fixtures shall meet IESNA “full-cutoff” criteria (no light output emitted above 90
degrees at any lateral angle around the fixture).
(3) The use of floodlighting, spotlighting, wall-mounted fixtures, decorative globes and
spheres and other fixtures not meeting IESNA “full-cutoff’ criteria, shall be permitted
only with the approval of the Township, based upon applicability in retaining the
desired character of the Township and achievement of acceptable glare control.
(4) Where requested by the Township, all fixtures shall be equipped with or be modified
to incorporate light directing and/or shielding devices such as shields, visors, skirts or
hoods to redirect offending light distribution and/or reduce direct or reflected glare.
(5) For residential applications, omni-directional fixtures, e.g., post top, wall bracket,
wallpack, globe and sphere shall have a cumulative lamp output per fixture not to
exceed 1000 lumens or a 60-watt incandescent bulb.
(6) NEMA-head fixtures, a.k.a. “barn lights” or “dusk-to-dawn lights,” shall not be
permitted where they intrude into other uses, unless fitted with a reflector to render
them full cutoff.
(7) Theme lighting, as a supplement to regular site lighting, is encouraged in the
Township villages and in new residential or commercial developments, subject to
Board of Supervisors approval. Theme lights shall have good shielding and lamphiding
qualities to be of low brightness, or lamped with the lowest possible wattage
bulb so as not to produce distracting and potentially hazardous glare at night.
C. Control of Glare
(1) All outdoor lighting, whether or not required by this ordinance, on private, residential,
commercial, industrial, recreational or institutional property; shall be aimed, located,
designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or
pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely traverse and so as not to create a
nuisance by projecting or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or
property.
(2) All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be shielded in such a manner that the edge of the
shield shall be level with or below the light source, so that direct light emitted above
the horizontal is eliminated.
(3) Floodlights and spotlights shall be so installed or aimed that they do not project their
output into the windows of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, skyward or onto a
public roadway.
(4) Unless otherwise permitted or limited by the Township, e.g., for safety or security or
all-night operations, lighting for commercial, industrial, public recreational and
institutional applications shall be controlled by automatic switching devices such as
time clocks or combination motion detectors and photocells, to permit extinguishing
outdoor lighting fixtures between 11 p.m. and dawn, to mitigate glare and sky-lighting
consequences.

business, and until one hour after closing. All signs shall meet the standards of Article
XIX of the Zoning Ordinance.
(7) Light output for flagpole lighting may not cumulatively exceed 10,000 lumens.
(8) Vegetative screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary means for
controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall be achieved primarily through the use of
such means as cutoff fixtures, shields and baffles, and appropriate application of
fixture mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and fixture placement.
(9) The intensity of illumination projected onto a residential use from another property
shall not exceed 0.1 vertical foot-candle measured along the line-of-sight at the
property line.
(10) Externally illuminated signs and billboards, where permitted, shall be lighted by
fixtures mounted at the top of the sign and aimed downward. Such fixtures shall be

specifically approved by the Township to illuminate necessary directional information.
(11) Except as specifically approved by the Township, fixtures meeting IESNA “cutoff’
criteria shall not be mounted in excess of twenty (20) feet above finished grade, but
shall not exceed sixteen (16) feet if within one hundred (100) feet of any existing
residential property line, and fixtures not meeting IESNA “cutoff” criteria shall not be
mounted in excess of sixteen (16) feet above grade.
(12) Directional fixtures for such applications as facade, fountain feature and landscape
illumination shall be aimed so as not to project their output beyond the objects
intended to be illuminated, and shall be extinguished between the hours of 11 p. m.
and dawn, unless permitted by the Township.
(13) Canopy lighting, e.g., for service stations, fuel dispensing facilities and bank driveups,
shall be accomplished using flat-lens full cutoff down-lighting fixtures, shielded in
such a manner that the edge of the fixture shield shall be level with or below the light
source envelope.
(14) The use of white strobe lighting for tall structures such as smokestacks, chimneys,
and radio, communications and television towers is prohibited, except as otherwise
required under Federal Aviation Administration regulations.

provided in Section 1715.10 herein, shall be performed. Where an existing lot fails to meet
East Pikeland Township’s well standards, the property owner shall provide a written
acknowledgement to the Township.
2. Hydrogeological Analysis.
For each well that is proposed, a local hydrogeological analysis including a pump test shall be
submitted to the Township prior to approval. A hydrogeological analysis shall include, but not be
limited to:
A. A pump or aquifer test, those items listed in this ordinance as being required to be
conducted.
B. A recommendation concerning the ability of the well(s) to provide the water required for its
intended use along with any potential off-site impacts.
C. Copies of all data generated during the analysis.
D. A properly conducted two-part certification.
E. A site plan showing the location of the well(s) as drilled.

provide a hydrogeologically quantified estimate of the maximum aquifer depletion caused
by the proposed wells after a period of one (1) year and five (5) years. The analysis shall
include values for the maximum and minimum cumulative pumping rates and water budget
estimates for precipitation, recharge, infiltration, evapotranspiration and baseflow. The
analysis shall include an estimate of the effects of pumping on the local groundwater level
and stream baseflow during the fifty (50) year drought event. In addition, the zone of
capture and the zone of influence shall be determined for the proposed well. The zone of
influence is defined as the zone in which an incremental change in groundwater level of 6
inches or more is expected. The zone of capture is defined as the aerial extent of the
waters (i.e. ground water, surface water, etc.) captured by the pumping of water.
3. Water Quality Analysis. The analysis shall include a quality analysis for the dry year nitrate
impact of on-site sewage disposal systems within the proposed subdivision or land development
on the underlying groundwater quality. In particular, the analysis must include an estimate of the
increase in nitrogen (including at least nitrate and ammonia) concentrations in the groundwater
and also provide a discussion of background nitrogen concentrations. The analysis shall also
provide an estimate of the nitrogen concentration in the ground water beneath the downgradient
property boundaries during the fifty (50) year drought using the methodology prescribed in
Section 1715.11 herein.
4. Biological Analysis. If the reduction in the stream baseflow affected area exceeds twenty
percent (20%) in any location, a biological impact analysis shall also be provided, as per U.S.

EPA’s Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Rivers. Specifically, Protocol II,
as updated for macroinvertebrate identification and analysis will be conducted. The data
collected will be used to calculate macroinvertebrate densities, percent dominant taxa, and
percent EPT richness, which is an estimate of the number of ephemeroptera, plecoptera, and
trichoptera relative to the total number of macroinvertebrates. Stream baseflow affected area is
the area of the stream flow that a pumping well impacts.
5. Methodology. The standards for conducting the above analyses shall be those adopted from
time to time by the Board of Supervisors based on the evolution of professional standards. The
initial standards are contained in Sections 1715.10 (pumping test report) and 1715.11 (nitrate
analysis report) herein which shall be changed from time to time by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors. An Applicant may employ an equivalent or better analytical methodology, as may
be accepted by the Board of Supervisors as such, upon advice of the Township engineer, and
associated other applicable professional review, upon request of the Applicant documenting the
proposed methodology.
6. Approvability.
A. In order to assure the availability of reliable, safe and adequate water supplies to support
the intended land uses within the capacity of available water resources and to protect the
aquifer, no development shall be approved which is:
(1) Predicted to reduce the site's attributed stream baseflow by more than fifty percent
(50%) of the Q750 using the following formula:
Allowable Withdrawal = Net site acreage x Q750 x 0.5
Total Watershed Acreage
and/or,
(2) Reduce the water table on adjoining properties by more than two (2) feet and/or to
increase nitrates the lower of an increment of two (2) mg/L or a total of ten (10) when
added to background nitrate condition at the downgradient property lines or streams
by two (2) mg/L and/or which reduces yields of present wells more than one hundred
(100) feet beyond the property line.
B. Developments affecting groundwater which fail to meet the standards may be modified to
meet the standard set forth in Section 1715.6.A. In the alternative, if there will be no
significant stream impact as set forth in Section 1715.6.A (1), the developer may secure
releases from all owners, accompanied by deed restrictions against all further development
affecting groundwater within the zone of influence.
7. Changes in Methodology. The assumptions to be utilized in the analysis shall be set forth by the
Board of Supervisors from time to time and in the absence thereof, by accepted or demonstrated
professional standards. The applicant may utilize other assumptions than those set forth by the
Board, if any, if the applicant establishes to the Board upon advice of the Township Engineer,
and other applicable professional review, that different assumptions are warranted.

8. Approved Data. The data prepared by the United States Geological Survey in the water study
known as the Hydrogeology and Ground-Water Quality of Chester County, Pennsylvania, Water
Resources Investigations Report 94-4109 and Hydrologic Data for Chester County,
Pennsylvania, Open-File Report 94-381, and/or the U. S Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia
District/ Final Market Feasibility Study, and Groundwater Monitoring Options, (MFS Study,
October, 1996) shall be considered authoritative unless shown to be wrong. The soils data
provided by the United States National Resource Conservation Service and the geologic data
provided by the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, Map of Pennsylvania 1981, shall be
considered authoritative unless disproved by satisfactory evidence.
9. Construction Standards. In the construction of wells, standards satisfactory to the Board of
Supervisors shall be employed and monitored. Standards which are acceptable shall be
adopted by the Board from time to time. The initial standards are set forth in Section 1715.12,
Well Standards. To the extent that an analysis depends on water conservation and recycling, the
standards shall include guarantees of implementation, well construction data and maintenance
which guarantees, satisfactory to the Township, shall be provided. All well drillers are required to
get an annual permit from the Zoning Officer.
10. Pumping Test Requirements.
A. Pumping Test for a Single Residence Development
As part of the approval process for any one-residence development, a two-part pumping
test must be completed on the potable well. Developments with greater than 5 residences
or anticipated water use of 4,000 gallons per day must complete a development-wide
pumping test and the procedures detailed in this Section shall not be applicable.
The purpose of the two-part test is to determine if the underlying aquifer provides a
sufficient yield for the residence's domestic needs. The developer or developer's
contractor must conduct the two-part pumping test as outlined below:
(1) The required pumping test consists of two parts. The second part must be performed
immediately upon completion of the first part.
(2) Part 1, Peak Demand Test
The first portion of the pumping test measures the ability of the well to meet the
predicted water demand of a household during the twice-daily peak use periods.
(3) Part 2, Constant Head Test
The second portion of the pumping tests measures the aquifer’s ability to supply
water to the well sufficient to meet the total daily water demand for the household.

Last Amended July 11, 2017 XVII - 40
B. Two-Part Pumping Test Procedure.
(1) Calculate the Peak Demand Rate and Peak Time according to the following formula:
Minimum Well Formula Assumptions:
Water usage is 100 gallons per day (gpd) per person;
Two persons occupy one bedroom; additional bedrooms are occupied by one person;
Two Peak Water Use Periods per day, and
Flow through plumbing fixtures = 3 gallons per minute (gpm) in bathrooms.
Peak Load = (no. of bedrooms) (no. of persons/bedroom) (gpd/person) peak periods/day
= (no. of bedrooms) (2) (100) = (no. of bedrooms) (100 gallons)
Peak Demand Rate = (gpm/bathroom) (no. of bathrooms) = (3 gpm) (no. of bathrooms)
Peak Time = peak load
peak demand rate
(2) Part 1, Perform peak demand pumping test:
a. Measure static water level in the well prior to the initiation of pumping;
b. Pump at peak demand rate for peak time and measure the water level in the
well at the completion of the test.
To pass, the well must be able to supply water at peak demand rate for peak time.
(3) Part 2, Perform the constant head pumping test immediately upon completion of the
peak demand test, regardless of whether or not the test was passed. The water level
must not be allowed to recover from the first test. The constant head pumping test
must be completed under the following procedures:
a. Adjust the pumping rate to a constant head pumping rate. The change in head
must be less than 0.50 feet per hour;
b. Convert the constant head pumping rate to gpd and compare to total household
demand.
To pass the test, the constant head pumping rate must equal the total demand.
All wells must also meet the 5 gpm minimum as specified in the well
construction standards. The well shall be flushed at a rate at least equal to two
hundred percent (200%) of the expected pump capacity for a minimum of two
(2) hours, or until the water discharging is clear and free from sand. During the
flushing operation the amount of drawdown and stability of the yield shall be
determined.

C. Aquifer Test Requirements for Multi-Dwelling Developments.
As part of the approval process for developments with greater than 5 dwellings, or 4,000
gallons per day, whichever is less, a development-wide pumping test must be performed.
A work plan for the pumping test must be submitted to East Pikeland Township and written
approval must be granted prior to the initiation of the test. A forty-eight (48) hour
commencement notice shall be provided to East Pikeland Township. The working plan
shall include estimates of initiation and completion dates of the tests. The purpose of the
development-wide pumping test is to determine the off-site impact of pumping and whether
or not increased water usage will adversely impact off-site well yields and stream flows.
The pumping test must be conducted by a well driller licensed to do business in
Pennsylvania using the procedures detailed below:
(1) Characterize the underlying geologic formation with available information, including
literature, field observations and well logs to obtain the following:
a. Aquifer thickness;
b. Thickness of overburden;
c. Known hydraulic conditions of the aquifer such as confined, semi-confined or
water table;
d. Depth to the water table or potentiometric surface;
e. Known permeable and semi-permeable zones;
f. Orientations of joints, fractures, and bedding planes;
g. Recharge areas;
h. Anticipated values of well yield, hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity and
storage coefficient;
i. Estimated groundwater flow directions, and
j. Locations of off-site potable wells within a five thousand (5,000) foot radius of
the proposed development.
k. Locations of streams, ponds, and other surface water bodies within a five
thousand (5,000) foot radius of the proposed development
(2) Design an appropriate pumping test using best professional judgment. The pumping
rate should be sufficient to supply water to meet twice the total daily water demand
for all the dwellings in the development. For example, if the development includes ten
(10) dwellings with a total of thirty-five (35) bedrooms, the pumping rate must be at
least fourteen thousand (14,000) gallons per day or nine and three-quarters (9.75)

(6) Co-Location and Siting. An application for a new Tower-Based WCF shall not be
approved unless the Board of Supervisors finds that the wireless communications
equipment planned for the proposed Tower-Based WCF cannot be accommodated
on an existing or approved structure or building. The Board may deny an application
to construct a new Tower-Based WCF if the WCF Applicant has not made a good
faith effort to mount the commercial communications antenna(s) on an existing
structure. The WCF Applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall
structures, buildings, and towers within a one quarter (¼) of a mile radius of the site
proposed, sought permission to install an Antenna on those structures, buildings, and
towers and was denied for one of the following reasons:
(a) The proposed Antenna and Related Equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of the existing building, structure or tower, and its reinforcement
cannot be accomplished at a reasonable cost.
(b) The proposed Antenna and Related Equipment would cause radio frequency
interference with other existing equipment for that existing building, structure, or
tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have adequate location,
space, access, or height to accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it
to perform its intended function.
(d) A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with the owner of
such building, structure, or tower.

Zoning Permit from the Township. Non-routine modifications shall be prohibited
without a permit.
(8) Gap in Coverage. A WCF Applicant for a Tower-Based WCF must demonstrate that
a significant gap in wireless coverage exists in the applicable area and that the type
of WCF being proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill that gap in
wireless coverage. The existence or non-existence of a gap in wireless coverage
shall be a factor in the Township’s decision on an application for approval of Tower-
Based WCFs.
(9) Additional Antennae. As a condition of approval for all Tower-Based WCFs, the WCF
Applicant shall provide the Township with a written commitment that it will allow other
service providers to co-locate Antennae on Tower-Based WCFs where technically
and economically feasible. The owner of a Tower-Based WCF shall not install any
additional Antennae without obtaining Zoning Permit approval of the Township.

Zoning Officer) of its intent to continue the use of the sign, then the sign shall be construed to
be abandoned by the Township and the permit for the same shall be revoked. If the
landowner/sign owner provides written notice of the intent to continue the use of the sign, then
the permit for such sign shall remain in effect (unless and until a future Abandonment Notice is
transmitted to the landowner/sign owner pursuant to this Section). If the landowner fails to do
so, then the Zoning Officer shall issue a notice to the landowner/sign owner to revoke the permit
for the sign and such sign may not be considered to be nonconforming with respect to any past
or future zoning ordinance amendments. The Township may then take any and all actions
pursuant to this Ordinance and otherwise pursuant to the law (including, but not limited to an
injunction.

lawful nonconforming sign may remain in place while maintained in good condition and not
abandoned, provided that such nonconforming sign may not be changed, expanded or altered
in size, dimension, location or use. If ownership or occupancy changes on a property where a
sign is located the sign must be made conforming and comply with the provisions of this Article
XIX. Once a sign is removed for any reason, the replacement sign must comply with all the
provisions of this Article XIX.

ARTICLE XX
CONDITIONAL USE PROCESS
Section 2000. PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA
1. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve the owner or his agent, the developer, or the
Applicant for a Conditional Use approval from obtaining approval in accordance with the East
Pikeland Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, or other applicable
ordinances.
2. The requirements of this section and the standards for specific types of Conditional Uses found
elsewhere in this Ordinance shall be deemed an element of the definition under which a
Conditional Use permit may be granted. The failure of the Applicant to demonstrate compliance
with these requirements, at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, can be deemed either a
basis for establishing conditions or limitations on an approval or the basis for a denial of a
Conditional Use application.
3. General Requirements
A. Ownership. The tract of land under application for a Conditional Use approval shall be
under one (1) ownership, or shall be the subject of an application filed jointly by the owners
of the entire tract, and shall be under unified control. If the ownership of the entire tract is
held under more than one (1) person or entity, the application shall identify and be filed on
behalf of all of the owners. Approval of the plan shall be conditioned upon agreement by
the Applicant or Applicants that the tract shall be developed under single direction in
accordance with the approved plan. No site preparation or construction shall be permitted
other than in accordance with the approved plan. If ownership of all or any portion of the
tract changes subsequent to approval of the plan, no site preparation or construction by
such new owner or owners shall be permitted unless and until such owner or owners shall
review the terms and obligations of the approved plan and agree in writing to be bound
thereby with respect to development of the tract.
B. Sewer and Water Facilities. The Applicant shall demonstrate evidence of adequate water
supply and sewage disposal capability. The tract of land shall be served by a water supply
system and a sewage system deemed acceptable by the Board of Supervisors upon
recommendation of the Township Engineer. Such facilities shall be designed and
constructed in compliance with Sections 419 and 420 of the East Pikeland Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance and the East Pikeland Township Sewage
Facilities (Act 537) Plan.
C. Development Stages and Permits. The development of a tract carried out in either a single
phase or in stages shall be executed in accordance with a development agreement. The
owner, developer, and Township shall enter into said agreement embodying all details
regarding compliance with this Ordinance to assure the binding nature thereof on the
overall tract and its development, which agreement shall be recorded with the final
development plan.

and screens, as well as other natural and constructed amenities in furtherance of the
comprehensive planning objectives of East Pikeland Township.
With respect to exact building locations, shapes and dimensions, an similar requirements
of the Development Plan, prescribed in the paragraph above, it is recognized that a fixed
and dimensioned architectural layout, as would be required for issuance of a building
permit, is not feasible, nor is it the intent of this Section of the Zoning Ordinance to require
such detail in an application for Conditional Use. However, the plans, information and data,
as herein required for Conditional Use approval, shall be indicated in sufficient detail to
serve as a firm commitment by the Applicant to the design criteria and standards. The
Development Plan shall be prepared at a scale of not more than one inch equals fifty feet
(1” = 50’). Where specific Conditional Use application requirements are contained in other
articles of this Ordinance and are applicable to a particular Conditional Use authorized by
this Ordinance, the Applicant shall comply with such requirements which shall prevail in the
event of conflict or overlap.
The Development Plan shall generally include the following elements: Site Layout Plan,
Existing Conditions and Environmental Resources Plan, Proposed Grading Plan,
Landscape, Screening and Buffering Plan, and Lighting Plan. Other Plans or plan
information may be required at the discretion of the Planning Commission or the Board of
Supervisors.
C. Natural and Cultural Resources Analysis. The Applicant shall provide an inventory of the
tract’s natural features and systems, cultural resources, and visual amenities that may be
impacted by the proposed Conditional Use. The inventory shall be prepared in graphic [at
a scale of one (1) inch = one hundred (100) feet] and narrative form on the site or in such
proximity as to be affected by the proposed Conditional Use:
(1) Surface waters;
(2) Natural drainage patterns, including swales, intermittent streams, etc.;

Space, Recreation, and Environmental Resources Plan, and patterns of vegetation,
including tree masses, rare or extraordinary individual species, any tree of six (6)
inches or greater DBH and areas serving as habitat for wildlife (species of wildlife
dependent upon the site for habitat shall be identified).
(9) Measurable attributes of the air quality at the proposed site and the present degree to
which auto emissions are contributing to degradation;
(10) Scenic resources as mapped and described in the East Pikeland Township Open

the proposed development, and shall describe mitigating measures to be employed in
addressing these impacts. The development impacts and the proposed mitigating
measures shall be described in narrative form, and their locations on the site and beyond
shall be mapped at a scale of one (1) inch = one hundred (100) feet.
D. Traffic Analysis. The Board of Supervisors, at its sole discretion, may require the Applicant
to provide traffic studies demonstrating feasible compliance with the objectives of this
ordinance and the East Pikeland Township Comprehensive Plan. The Township Traffic
Consultant shall provide the Applicant the minimum scope of work to be included in the
analysis. The Traffic Impact Study requirements of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance shall be followed. Such studies shall estimate traffic volumes, turning
movements, and levels of service at intersections, and potentially unsafe conditions
existing prior to development as well as may be reasonably expected to occur after
proposed development and shall suggest action(s) to mitigate any anticipated reduction of
level of service or other negative impact to traffic conditions resulting from development as
proposed. In granting Conditional Use approval, the Board may attach conditions requiring
specific improvements to roads to be incorporated into plans for development, to the extent
necessary to maintain pre-existing levels of service, correct unsafe conditions which may
be worsened by traffic impacts of development, and otherwise provide for safe and
convenient access for residents, visitors, employees, and emergency service personnel
and vehicles.
E. Storm Water Management and Drainage Analysis. The application for Conditional Use
approval shall be accompanied by a conceptual Storm Water Management and Drainage
Analysis. The analysis shall demonstrate, conceptually, to the satisfaction of the Township

shall be related to the initial, if staged, and completed subdivision or land development.
G. Community Facilities and Services Assessment. The Board of Supervisors, at its sole
discretion may require the Applicant to provide an assessment of the facility and service

including the forwarding of any recommendation to the Board of Supervisors. The Planning
Commission may extend its period of deliberation beyond sixty days upon written
authorization by the Applicant. If the Planning Commission does not transmit its
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors by the date set by the Board of Supervisors
for public hearing for consideration of the Conditional Use application, the Board of

Enforcement Officer, and to any person who has made timely written request for
same. Notice of the hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of
land at least one (1) week prior to the date of the hearing. The failure of any person
or entity to receive notice given pursuant to this section shall not constitute grounds
for any court to invalidate the actions of the Township for which the notice was given.
The Board of Supervisors shall commence its first hearing on the application within
sixty (60) days from the date the application is filed with the Township Secretary,
unless extended by written authorization from the Applicant.

for a Conditional Use shall be only as prescribed and within such times permitted by
the applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code as
amended.
C. In granting Conditional Use approval, where such use is authorized under this Ordinance,
the Board of Supervisors may also attach such conditions and safeguards, in addition to
those expressed in this Ordinance, as it may deem necessary to implement the purpose of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and this Ordinance.
Conditional Uses shall be subject to compliance with particular standards contained in this
Ordinance and criteria defined in the application review process. The standards described
shall be deemed additional and shall in no way impair any other applicable standard from
this or any other Township ordinance. The Applicant shall be responsible for demonstrating
compliance with all standards and criteria required for Conditional Use approval. The
conditions of approval may include, but need not be limited to:
(1) Specific modifications to area and bulk requirements as might otherwise be
applicable;
(2) Provisions for additional utility or traffic safety facilities;
(3) Securing of additional easements or property to assure proper site design;
(4) Modification to the applicable design standards; or

approved shall require a new Conditional Use approval.
D. The Applicant shall have the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the
proposed use will comply in all respects with this and other Township ordinances, County,
State or Federal legislation. The Board of Supervisors may retain such consultants as
necessary to review and certify the accuracy of submitted plans and documents, the
reasonable and necessary charges for which shall be borne by the Applicant. When the
Applicant does not provide information as required, then it shall be presumed that the
proposed use is not in accordance with the requirements applicable for the granting of
Conditional Use approval.
E. Any grant of Conditional Use approval shall be deemed null and void twelve (12) months
from the date of such approval if, within that period, no application is made for a building
permit, a use and occupancy permit, or subdivision or land development approval, as
appropriate, unless so extended by the Board of Supervisors.
Any request to extend the twelve (12) month expiration period shall be properly filed with
the Zoning Officer thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration date. The request shall
include the reason why the extension is required, a reasonable estimate of the time
needed to obtain the necessary approvals, and a qualified statement that there has been
no change in the Conditional Use application or the neighborhood in which the property is
located. Failure to diligently pursue necessary approvals shall not be grounds for an

provided a reasonable argument is presented. No more than one such extension shall be
granted per Conditional Use approval
6. Criteria for Review of Conditional Use Applications.
The following criteria shall be used as a guide by the Board of Supervisors in the evaluation of a
proposed Conditional Use. It shall be the burden of the Applicant to demonstrate compliance with all
applicable criteria:
A. Any Applicant for Conditional Use approval shall have the burden of demonstrating to the
satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that provision is made to adequately reduce or
minimize any noxious, offensive, dangerous or hazardous feature or features thereof, as
the case may be. The Board of Supervisors may deny Conditional Use approval where the
Applicant has failed to do so or where any use otherwise is deemed to be dangerous or
potentially dangerous to the public health, welfare or safety or which constitutes or may
constitute a public hazard whether by fire, explosion or otherwise.
B. The proposed use(s) shall be limited to those authorized Conditional Uses within the
District in which the lot or parcel is situated. The property subject to Conditional Use
application shall be suitable for the use desired.
C. The size, scope, extent and character of the Conditional Use desired shall be consistent
with the spirit, purposes and intent of the East Pikeland Township Comprehensive Plan,
Open Space, Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan, and Zoning Ordinance.
D. The proposed use at the location set forth in the application shall be in the public interest
and serve the public health, safety, moral and general welfare.
E. Consideration of the character and the type of development in the area surrounding the
location for which the request is made, and a determination that the proposed use is
appropriate in the area and will not injure or detract from the use or value of the
surrounding properties or from the character of the neighborhood.
F. The development, if more than one building, will consist of a harmonious grouping of
buildings or other structures.
G. There will be no adverse affect of the proposed Conditional Use upon the logical, efficient
and economical extension of public services and facilities, such as public water, sewers,
police and fire protection, emergency management services, recreational opportunities,
open space and public schools and, where necessary, adequate arrangements for
expansion or improvement of such services and facilities are ensured.
H. The design and use of any new construction and proposed change in use of existing
buildings will be compatible with the existing designs and uses in the immediate vicinity
and that the proposed design or use shall be compatible with the character of the
neighborhood.

I. If the development is to be carried out in progressive stages, each stage shall be so
planned that the conditions and intent of this Ordinance shall be fully complied with at the
completion of any stage.
J. The location and layout of the proposed use is suitable with respect to probable effects
upon highway traffic, and assures adequate access arrangements in order to protect major
streets and highways from undue congestion and hazard. The proposed use will not lower
the level of service on adjacent road segments and intersections as defined by the most
recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual from the Transportation Research Board.
As a policy, proposed projects should incorporate designs that will assure safe and

Section 2208. STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF A SPECIAL EXCEPTION
The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and decide all requests for a Special Exception, and the Board
must determine that the following standards and criteria are met before granting the request:
1. The size, scope, extent and character of the Special Exception request is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan of the Township and promotes the harmonious and orderly development of
the zoning district involved.
2. The proposed Special Exception is an appropriate use consistent with the character and type of
development in the area surrounding the location for which the request is made and will not
substantially impair, alter or detract from the use of surrounding property or of the character of
the neighborhood in light of the zoning classification of the area affected; the effect on other
properties in the area; the number, extent and scope of nonconforming uses in the area; and the
presence or the absence in the neighborhood of conditions or uses which are the same or
similar in character to the condition or use for which Applicant seeks approval.
3. The proposed Special Exception is suitable with respect to traffic and highways in the area and
provides for adequate access and off-street parking arrangements in order to protect major
streets and highways from undue congestion and hazard.
4. Major street and highway frontage will be developed so as to limit the total number of access
points and encourage the frontage of building on parallel marginal roads or on roads
perpendicular to the major street or highway.
5. The proposed Special Exception is reasonable in terms of the logical, efficient and economical
extension of public services and facilities, such as public water, sewers, police, fire protection,
and public schools, and ensures adequate arrangements for the extension of such services and
facilities in specific instances.
6. All commercial or industrial parking, loading, access or service areas will be adequately
illuminated at night while in use and arranged so as to comply with the requirements of Sections
1705, 1706, 1707 and 1711, herein, and Article IV of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance relating to access and highway frontage.
7. Conditions are being imposed on the grant of the request necessary to ensure that the general
purpose and intent of the property adjacent to the area included in the proposed Special
Exception is adequately safeguarded with respect to harmonious design of buildings, aesthetics,
planting and its maintenance as a sight or sound screen, landscaping, hours of operation,
lighting, numbers of persons involved, allied activities, ventilation, noise, sanitation, safety,
smoke and fume control and the minimizing of noxious, offensive or hazardous elements.

Land Development Ordinance and all other applicable governmental regulations.
10. The proposed Special Exception shall comply with any additional criteria of Section 2209,

Section 2209. STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF A VARIANCE
The Board may grant a Variance provided that the specifically enumerated criteria set forth in Section
910.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as follows, are met:
1. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
2. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and
that the authorization of a Variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
3. That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
4. That the Variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
5. That the Variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will, afford relief and
will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
In granting any variance the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance.
Section 2210. BURDEN OF PROOF AND CONDITIONS
To the maximum extent permitted by law, all burdens of proof and persuasion shall be upon the
landowner in connection with any Variance, Special Exception, or other application or appeal before
the Zoning Hearing Board. In allowing a Variance or Special Exception, the Zoning Hearing Board
may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the
Ordinance, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code and this Zoning Ordinance.

decision is called for make written findings on the application within forty-five (45) days after the
last hearing before the Board or hearing officer. Where the application is contested or denied,
each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together
with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of this act or of any ordinance,

(30) days after the report of the hearing officer. Where the Board fails to render the decision

have been rendered in favor of the Applicant unless the Applicant has agreed in writing or on the
record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the Applicant
because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the
Board shall give public notice of said decision within ten (10) days from the last day it could have
met to render a decision in the same manner as provided in this Section. If the Board shall fail to
provide such notice, the Applicant may do so. Nothing in this Subsection shall prejudice the
right of any party opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction.
2. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the findings shall be delivered
to the Applicant personally or mailed to him not later than the day following its date. To all other
persons who have filed their name and address with the Board not later than the last day of the
hearing, the Board shall provide by mail or otherwise, brief notice of the decision or findings and
a statement of the place at which the full decision or findings may be examined.
Section 2212. RECORDING OF TERMS OF APPROVAL
Where the Board grants approval of a Special Exception or Variance, it shall provide a memorandum
to the Applicant, stipulating the terms and conditions of such approval. Such memorandum shall
contain a sufficient legal description of the property in question. The Applicant shall execute and
provide to the Township a recordable notarized copy of the memorandum, and shall consent to its

(12) months from the date of such approval if, within that period, no application is made for a
building permit, use and occupancy permit, sedimentation and erosion control permit,
subdivision or land development approval, or any other approval or permit required by the

Variance, unless so extended by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to Section 2214.2.
2. The twelve (12) month expiration period may be extended by the Board of Zoning Appeals,
provided, that such request for an extension shall be properly filed with the Zoning Officer at
least seven (7) calendar days in advance of the expiration date. The request shall include the
reason why the extension is required, a reasonable estimate of the time needed to obtain the
necessary approvals, and a qualified statement that there has been no change in either the
circumstances giving rise to the grant of relief or the neighborhood in which the property is
located. Failure to diligently pursue necessary approvals shall not be grounds for an extension.
The Board may grant up to one additional twelve (12) month extension provided a reasonable
argument is presented. No more than one such extension shall be granted per Special

formed by shallow building setbacks on both
sides of a street, approximately 60 to 85 feet
apart.
Main Street at Exton streetscape: “Bookend Buildings” along
street, forms “Outdoor Room”
Design Guidelines:
1. Buildings in the range o f 50 ,000 t o
65,000 square feet on the ground floor should
be positioned without being dysfunctional.
2. Large scale retail should add value to
a neighborhood and respect local character.
3. Large scale retail building types can be
edged with liner shops to decrease the
apparent scale of the building.

Lowe’s in Morrisville, North Carolina (as viewed from frontage Lowe’s articulated façade
street)
Overview:
• This Lowe’s (located near the Raleigh-Durham
airport in North Carolina) has two notable
façades, one towards the frontage street and one
towards the parking lot.
• Although Lowe’s is one use, it appears as a
multiple-use group of buildings.
• The massive scale of a building can be toned
down through articulation of the roof and façade.
Design Guidelines:
1. More attractive architectural statements should
be made, through such design features as:
a. articulation of the façade;
b. two-story construction;
c. recesses and projections to the façade;
d. varied roof design;
e. varied building materials;
f. varied massing of the building parts.

Wal-Mart entry & forecourt Wal-Mart roof projection & portico
Overview:
• This Wal-Mart (located on Hilton Head
Island, South Carolina,) is articulated with sloped
roofs and a projected roof and portico.
• In contrast with the conventional Wal-Mart
store that projects a stark big-box appearance,
the careful design and articulation of the
building, the front yard, the parking lot, and the
overall landscape, results in a more attractive
and user- friendly environment.
Design Guidelines:
1. A distinctive Streetscape character, not typically
found at big-box store locations, should be
provided with:
a. varied building materials;
b. roof projections,
c. the portico,
d. varied colors,
e. generous landscaping,
f. pedestrian amenities.

outdoor seating allow the private indoor
realm to integrate with the public outdoor
realm.
Design Guidelines:
1. Provide and maintain
neighborhood scale buildings to the
maximum extent possible.
2. Create and maintain opportunities for
outdoor seating and dining.
3. Utilize design elements that merge indoor
uses with the public outdoor environment.

East Pikeland Township - Chester County, PA
Street Corner Transformation Example 1
Images source: New Urban News.
Overview:
• Parking dominated landscapes typical of
strip commercial centers can be made into
attractive and integral parts of an accessible
streetscape through effective architecture
and/or site enhancement.
• Buildings that are sited close to the ROWs
create a clearly-defined street corner that
integrates the streetscape with the adjacent
built environment.
• Visually appealing corner gateway features
are pedestrian friendly amenities that attract
motorists’ attention while deemphasizing the
visual prominence and banality of large
parking fields.
Street Corner Transformation Example 2
Design Guidelines:
1. Buildings can be sited to screen parts of
parking fields from the street and create direct
relationships between the public
street/sidewalk realm and the
private/commercial realm of the buildings; or
2. Gateway features can be created at street
corners through use of:
a. Architectural and site features that
direct attention away from expanses of
parking;
b. monuments such as sculpture or
fountains placed adjacent to the street
intersection;
c. public seating and gathering places;
and
d. effective use of tree and shrub
plantings.

The Ordinance is designed:
A. To accomplish a coordinated development of the Township, thereby
creating conditions favorable to the health, safety and general welfare of
the citizens in conformance with the East Pikeland Township
Comprehensive Plan;
B. To secure sites suitable for building purposes and human habitation
while protecting the soils, vegetation, quality of the waters and other

recreation public grounds and other facilities;
E. To allow innovative, quality subdivision design; and
F. To encourage desirable development of the Township in a manner
consistent with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and
other ordinances of East Pikeland Township.
SECTION 102 INTERPRETATION
The provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion and protection of the above stated purposes. Where the provisions of this
Ordinance impose greater restrictions than those of any other applicable ordinance or
regulation, the provisions of this Ordinance and its standards and specifications shall
prevail. Where the provisions of any statute, other ordinance or regulation impose
greater restrictions than this Ordinance, the provisions of such statute, ordinance or
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended November 11, 2008 I -2
regulation shall prevail.
SECTION 103 CONTROL
All subdivision and land development within East Pikeland Township is subject to the
provisions of this Ordinance and all plats of land intended for subdivision or land
development must first be submitted to the Board of Supervisors of East Pikeland
Township for approval.
A. Subdivision and Land Development Control
No land development, subdivision or resubdivision of a lot, tract or parcel
of land shall be effected, and no street, sanitary sewer, storm drain,
water main or other facility in connection therewith shall be laid out,
constructed, opened or dedicated for public use or travel, or for the
common use of occupants of buildings abutting hereon, except in strict
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
B. Sale of Lots, Issuance of Building Permits, Erection of Buildings or On
Site Improvements
In a subdivision or land development, no lot may be used, or sold, no
building permit may be issued, and no building or other structure may be
erected, unless and until a final plan for such subdivision or land
development shall have been approved and duly recorded, and a grading
plan, including a complete conservation plan for erosion and sediment
control, has been duly approved, and until either the required on site
and/or public improvements in connection therewith from the lot or
building to an existing improved street, or otherwise, shall have been
constructed or the Township has been assured, by means of a proper
performance guarantee in the form of an acceptable bond, letter of credit
or deposit of funds or securities in escrow sufficient to cover the cost of
all required public and on-site improvements, as estimated by the
Township Engineer, that such public and on-site improvements will
subsequently be installed by the subdivider or owner of the property.
Where, owing to unusual and specific conditions, a literal enforcement of
any of the provisions of this section would result in unnecessary
hardship, such reasonable exceptions thereto may be made by the
Township Supervisors in accordance with Section 704 of this
Ordinance, as will not be contrary to the interests of the public or
property owner involved or adjacent thereto, in which case the issuance
of a permit, or erection of a building, or other structure may be permitted
subject to such conditions and safeguards as may be imposed to
assure adequate streets and other public improvements, and adequate
conservation and other on-site improvements.

5. Four-Step Design Process
All major subdivision preliminary plans in the R-1, Farm Residential,
R-2, Community Residential, and AP, Agricultural Preservation.
Districts shall include documentation of the four-step design process
in determining the layout of proposed Greenway lands, house sites,
streets and lot lines as described below.
a. Step 1: Delineation of Greenway Lands
Proposed Greenway lands shall be designated using the
Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan as a base
map and complying with Section 1714 of the Zoning
Ordinance, dealing with Park, Recreation, Open Space,
Greenway and Trail Standards. The East Pikeland

comprising of greenways and trails, prime farmland,
agriculturally-suited soils, riparian buffer conservation
areas, wetland buffer, hedgerows, wildlife habitats,
historic sites and structures, scenic viewsheds,
seasonally high water table soils, and French Creek
Scenic River Corridor. On the basis of those priorities
and practical considerations given to the site's
configuration, its context in relation to resource areas on
adjoining and neighboring properties, and the applicant's
subdivision objectives, Secondary Conservation Areas
shall be delineated to meet at least the minimum area
percentage requirements for Greenway lands. The
boundaries as well as the types of resources included
within the Secondary Conservation Areas shall be
clearly indicated. Calculations shall be provided
indicating the applicant's compliance with the acreage
requirements for Greenway areas on the site.

Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 16
b. Step 2: Location of House Sites
Potential house sites shall be tentatively located, using
the proposed Greenway lands as a base map as well as
other relevant data on the Existing Resources and Site
Analysis Plan such as topography and soils. House sites
should be generally located not closer than one hundred
(100) feet from Primary Conservation Areas and fifty
(50) feet from Secondary Conservation Areas, taking
into consideration the potential negative impacts of
residential development on such areas as well as the
potential positive benefits of such locations to provide
attractive views and visual settings for residences.
c. Step 3: Alignment of Streets and Trails
Upon designating the house sites, a street plan shall be
designed to provide vehicular access to each house,
complying with the standards in Article IV herein and
bearing a logical relationship to topographic conditions.
Impacts of the street plan on proposed Greenway lands
shall be minimized, particularly with respect to crossing
environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and
traversing slopes in excess of fifteen (15) percent. Street
connections shall be encouraged to generally minimize
the number of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by East
Pikeland Township and to facilitate access to and from
homes on different parts of the site (and adjoining
parcels).
A trail plan shall be provided that delineates the location
of existing and/or proposed trail corridors throughout the
property, with consideration of those trails corridors that
connect with trails on adjacent properties or provide
potential trail links to the Comprehensive Trail System.
Where no such trails exist, the Applicant shall, after
consulting the Comprehensive Trail System delineation
in the East Pikeland Township Open Space, Recreation
and Environmental Resources Plan, propose a trail
corridor that would link the Applicant’s proposed
subdivision or land development with the
Comprehensive Trail System.
d. Step 4: Drawing in the Lot Lines
Upon completion of the preceding three steps, lot lines
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 17
are drawn as required to delineate the boundaries of
individual residential lots.
e. Applicants shall submit four (4) separate sketch maps or
one (1) composite map, at the option of the Planning
Commission, indicating the findings of each step of the
design process.
6. Preliminary Resource Impact and Erosion and Sediment Control
Plan
a. A Preliminary Resource Impact and Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan shall be prepared, and to
categorize the impacts of the proposed subdivision and
land development on those resources shown on the
Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan (as required
under Section 304.C.3). All proposed improvements,
including, but not necessarily limited to grading, fill,
streets, buildings, utilities and stormwater detention
facilities, as proposed in the other Preliminary Plan
documents, shall be taken into account in preparing the
Preliminary Resource Impact and Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan.
b. Using the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan as a
base map, impact areas shall be mapped according to
the following categories: (1) Primary Conservation Areas
as defined by Section 304.C.5.(a), i.e., areas directly
impacted by the proposed subdivision, (2) Secondary
Conservation Areas as defined by Section 304.C.5.(a),
i.e., areas in proximity to primary areas that may be
impacted, and (3) designated protected areas, either to
be included in a proposed Greenway or an equivalent
designation such as dedication of a neighborhood park
site.
c. This requirement for a Preliminary Resource Impact and
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan may be waived by
the Planning Commission if, in its judgment, the proposed
development areas, as laid out in the Sketch Plan would
be likely to cause no more than an insignificant impact
upon the site's resources.

Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 46
accordance with the design plans prior to
final Township approval of the
improvements.
b. The Township Engineer may require a flatter slope when
it is found that the material in which the excavation is to
be made is unusually subject to erosion or if other
conditions exist which make such a shallower slope
necessary for stability and safety.
c. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be located at least
five (5) feet from property lines, in order to permit a
gradual rounding of the edge without encroaching onto
the abutting property.
d. Excavation shall not exceed below the angle of repose or
natural slope of the soil under the nearest point of any
footing or foundation or any existing building or structure
unless such footing or foundation is firstly properly
underpinned or protected against settlement.
e. Grading shall not redirect or concentrate surface water
onto an adjacent property.
f. During grading operations, necessary measures for dust
control to prevent particulate matter from becoming
airborne shall be followed. These measures shall
include, but not be limited to the following:
(1) A tire cleaning area shall be provided at each
point of egress from the development areas;
(2) Use, where possible, of water or other method
approved by the Township Engineer for control of
dust during any land disturbance activity; and
(3) Prompt removal of earth or other material from
paved streets.
g. Grading equipment shall not be allowed to cross
permanent or intermittent streams without first obtaining

East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 47
other damage which might result from such land
disturbance. If in the opinion of the Township Engineer,
the land disturbance would create a hazard to life or
property unless adequately safe-guarded, the applicant
shall construct walls, fences, guardrails, or other
structures to safeguard the adjoining property, public
street, sidewalk, alley, or other property and persons.
i. Excavation or fills shall not encroach on natural

spread. The Township Engineer may require compaction
tests and reports.
k. Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface
waters from damaging the cut face of an excavation or
the sloping surface or a fill within the area of a proposed
subdivision or land development. Slopes of more than
ten (10) feet in vertical height shall be separated by level
berms of at least four (4) feet in width within which
ditches shall be constructed where necessary to prevent
erosion and as a safe place to deposit and receive such
water. The Township Engineer may require such
drainage structures or pipes to be constructed or installed
which are perceived necessary to prevent erosion
damage and to satisfactorily carry off surface waters.
7. Grading for Drainage
a. All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide
property drainage away from buildings with a minimum
slope of two 2% percent, and to dispose of water without
ponding. All land within a development shall be graded

As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 49
10. Compliance with Regulations and Procedures
a. The Township, in considering preliminary subdivision and
land development plans shall condition its approval upon
the execution of soil erosion and sediment control
measures as required by this Ordinance.
b. Each application shall contain a commitment to submit for
approval, a modified soil erosion and sediment control
plan should the proposed plan prove to be inadequate
prior to final release of escrow and dedication of
improvements.
B. Stormwater Management Plan
A Stormwater Management Plan is required to accompany the
preliminary and the final subdivision or land development plan. Said
Plan shall include maps and reports, as necessary, prepared in
accordance with Chapter 22, Grading, Erosion and Sediment Control
and Stormwater Management, of the Code of Ordinances of the
Township of East Pikeland.
1. Purpose.
The purpose of the Stormwater Management Plan is to identify
practices and techniques that shall be incorporated into all
subdivision and land development proposals that will ensure that
stormwater management plans of the proposed development
address the following concerns:
a. The disturbance of the site does not result in damaging
stormwater runoff problems in order to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the Township residents. These
objectives will be pursued at the Township level in
conjunction with state requirements for stormwater
management, as defined in the Pennsylvania Stormwater
Management Act (Act 167), as amended;
b. Protect water quality, enhance groundwater availability
and reduce flooding potential through effective
stormwater management, as detailed in the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual,
December 2006 (BMP Manual), as amended.
c. The site design and preparation incorporates necessary
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 50
steps to ensure the successful installation and long-term
operation of stormwater management facilities;
d. The goals and objectives for the implementation of the
East Pikeland Park, Recreation and Open Space
component of the Comprehensive Plan, as amended,
and regulated in Section 424 of this Ordinance, are linked
with other land development concerns;
e. The natural feature protection objectives of Section 425
of this Ordinance are maintained;
f. Potential flooding hazards and damage as a result of
increased rates and volumes of stormwater runoff from
the proposed development site both during and after the
construction phase are identified and adequately
addressed;
g. The project, as proposed, will neither increase the
present size of the flood plain or the frequency of floods
that occur within the floodplain;
h. Stream banks and beds will not be adversely affected by
increase flow rates or volumes, leading to the erosion or
realignment of existing channels;
i. Increases in stormwater runoff shall, where feasible, be
recharged to groundwater that will reduce stream flows
through reduction of recharge of local groundwater since
ground water reserves provide the base flow in streams;
j. Prevent the pollution of surface water resources from
non-point sources resulting from increased development
and runoff. Such pollution results from the introduction of
increased impervious cover, loss of natural vegetation
cover which acts to purify stormwater runoff, and
collection of pollutants linked to development;
k. Protect local water resources through groundwater
recharge. Local aquifers depend upon rainfall to maintain
existing groundwater table levels, as well as existing
groundwater quality;
l. Prevent increased stormwater flows that will result in
increasing erosion and sedimentation problems, both on
and off the site, loss of valuable topsoil and damage of
property, natural and man-made drainage facilities and
natural resources.
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 51
m. Traditional stormwater management techniques have
resulted in space-consuming, unsightly, difficult to
maintain basins and facilities which often do not function
as intended, become safety hazards, and conflict with
environmental preservation goals of the community.
n. The provisions of the Stormwater Management Plan shall
be held to be minimum requirements to meet the abovestated
purposes. Where the provisions of this Chapter
impose greater restrictions than those of any other
statute, ordinance or regulation, including, but not limited
to the BMP Manual, the provisions of this Chapter shall
prevail. Where the provisions of any other statute,
ordinance or regulation (including BMP manual) impose
greater restrictions than those of this Chapter, the
provisions of such statute, ordinance or regulation shall
prevail.
2. General Provisions.
The following provisions shall be followed and incorporated into
the development review and construction process:
a. The landowner or developer shall construct and/or install
drainage facilities as are required by this Ordinance or
any other Township, County or State requirements, to
prevent soil erosion, damage, siltation, and to
satisfactorily manage stormwater to prevent the
impairment of public safety or physical damage due to
the concentration of stormwater runoff onto adjacent
properties. All land areas shall be graded to secure
proper drainage away from buildings, on-site sewage
disposal systems, and to prevent the uncontrolled
collection of stormwater in pools. The system shall be
designed to, as much as possible, collect and recharge
water.
b. The rate of stormwater runoff from any proposed
subdivision or land development shall not exceed the rate
of runoff prior to development. Subparagraph 5 of this
subsection outlines requirements for design of
stormwater management systems that incorporate
ground water recharge as an essential element in order
to control quantity of discharge. The distribution of
drainage discharge from the developed properties shall
replicate that of before development conditions to the
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 52
maximum extent possible. The methodology and
facilities used shall be based on the anticipated flows and
conditions of each particular site.
c. The stormwater management plan for each subdivision or
land development proposal shall take into account and
provide for the peak rate and volume flows of other areas
in the watershed to ensure that cumulative problems are
not increased as a result of flows from the proposed
project. This analysis shall also explore possibilities to
share stormwater management facilities with other areas
in the watershed, in which case consultation with the
Township shall be required prior to design.
d. Recharge facilities, detention facilities, storm sewers,
culverts, bridges and related drainage installations shall
be provided:
(1) To permit unimpeded flow of natural
watercourses. Such flow may be redirected as
required, subject to the approval of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection;
(2) To insure adequate drainage of all low points as
may be related to streets;
(3) To intercept stormwater runoff along streets at
intervals reasonably related to the extent and
grade of the area drained to prevent flow of
stormwater across intersections, and to prevent
the flooding of intersections during the design
storm;
(4) To insure adequate and unimpeded flow of
stormwater under driveways in, near, or across
natural watercourses or drainage swales.
Properly sized pipes or other conduits shall be
provided, as necessary;
(5) To prevent excessive flow on or across streets,
sidewalks, drives, parking areas, and any other
paved surface or access-way;
(6) To lead stormwater away from springs.
To this end, the storm drainage system serving

USGS Quadrangle maps of the area, and/or determined
as such pursuant to an on-site survey by the Township or
their representatives.
h. Retention/detention basins shall be designed to utilize the
natural contours of the land. When such design is
impracticable, the construction of the basin shall utilize
slopes as shallow as possible to blend the structures into
the existing terrain. The use of multiple
retention/detention facilities, which are smaller and less
intrusive on the site, is encouraged to meet the
requirements of this Section.
i. All areas containing lakes, ponds, wetlands and
watercourses shall be considered to be reserved for
permanent open space. Any alteration, development,
filling, piping or diverting of such water resources shall be
in strict compliance with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance, especially those pertaining to the Flood Plain
District, and all prevailing rules and regulations of State
and Federal agencies. The Township recognizes the use

management facilities and encourages such innovative
use if assurances are met that conservation measures
are adequate and that all Federal and State requirements
are satisfied.
j. The Board of Supervisors may require that a landowner
or developer provide reasonable corrective measures to
alleviate an existing off-site drainage problem that may
be affected by the proposed subdivision and/or land
development or could be mitigated y providing
stormwater management facilities on the property
proposed for subdivision and/or land development. It
shall be the responsibility of the landowner or developer
to obtain all drainage easements on, over, or through
other properties, and the Township, its agents, workmen,
servants and employees shall be indemnified and held
harmless from any liability.
k. Any water originating from non-natural sources, such as
swimming pools, air conditioning units, sump pumps, roof
drains, or other similar flow, shall be properly discharged
into a recharge facility or natural watercourses on the
property or connected to an existing or proposed storm
drainage system as approved by the Township. Polluting
matter from such sources may not be deposited into
natural watercourses or storm drains.
l. Any water originating from non-natural sources, as

5. Stormwater Management System Design and Application.
To achieve the objectives outlined in Section 306.B.1 of this
Ordinance, the Township encourages all proposed subdivision
and land development projects to utilize stormwater
management techniques that do not create any stormwater
runoff from the site area. In some instances, this goal cannot be
achieved due to site constraints. All proposed subdivision and
land development projects in East Pikeland Township shall be
required, however, to meet the following minimum stormwater
management criteria:
a. Stormwater Runoff Control.
(1) Peak Discharge - The peak rate of stormwater
runoff discharge from any proposed subdivision or
land development, assuming full development,
shall not exceed the peak rate of discharge from
the site prior to development based on the
following criteria:
Post Development Site Discharge Criteria vs.
Design Storm Pre-Development Storms
1 year – 24 hour storm 75% (.75) of the 1 year –
(99.9% annual chance) 24 hour storm
10 year – 24 hour storm 2 year – 24 hour storm
(10% annual chance)
25 year (4% annual chance) 25 year
50 year (2% annual chance) 50 year
The reduction criteria for the 1 year and 10 year design
storms will apply only to areas disturbed by the land
development. The above design criteria are in addition to
all required groundwater recharge requirements.
Infiltration system volume shall not be used as part of the
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 58
storage volume necessary to achieve the above listed
peak rate attenuation requirements.
(2) Recharge Volume – In addition to the control of
the rate of stormwater runoff, the volume of runoff
from any proposed subdivision or land
development, assuming full development, shall
not exceed the volume of discharge from the site
prior to development based on the following
criteria. To the extent that a site is made
impervious as a result of proposed development,
recharge requirements are set at a specified
volume equal to the runoff of a two (2) year,
twenty-four (24) hour storm (3.3 inches of rainfall)
per unit area of new impervious surface.
In addition, to the extent that a site is made less
pervious by development (re-grading, recompaction,
loss of vegetation, or any land
disturbance), but not made totally impervious, a
recharge volume requirement of one (1) inch per
unit area is required as well. Runoff volumes
shall be calculated using the Soil Cover Complex
Method of the NRCS. The applicant is required to
include these calculations in the volume
requirements to be accommodated by the
stormwater management system. Infiltration
systems shall always be designed such that
failure of the infiltration component does not
eliminate compliance with the required peak rate
attenuation capability of the BMP.
(3) Stormwater Distribution - The distribution of runoff
from the developed property onto adjacent
properties shall, to the maximum extent possible,
be in the same direction as that which existed
before development. No new concentrations of
stormwater discharge will be permitted.
(4) Runoff Control Devices – The increased runoff
that may result from subdivisions or land
developments shall be controlled by permanent
runoff control measures that will provide the
required runoff control specified above. All runoff
control devices will be evaluated for the
effectiveness to maintain the above mentioned
standard for all storms within a return period of up
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 59
to one hundred (100) years and may be required
to control storms of one (1), two (2), five (5), ten
(10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred
(100) year frequency.
b. Stormwater Systems Application Hierarchy – Stormwater
management methods shall be utilized to develop a
stormwater management plan which will lead to the
maximum retention of the quantity of stormwater in the
site with groundwater recharge. The stormwater
management practices to be utilized in developing a
stormwater management plan shall be designed and
provided according to the following order of preference:
(1) Infiltration of runoff on-site;
(2) Stormwater retention structures;
(3) Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales
and natural depressions; and
(4) Stormwater detention structures.
A combination of successive practices may be used to
achieve the applicable minimum control standards.
Justification shall be provided by the applicant for
rejecting higher preference choices in favor of other
alternatives.
Methods of stormwater control may include one or more
of the following Best Management Practices:
(1) Utilization of minimum disturbance/minimum
maintenance practices;
(2) Decreased impervious area coverage;
(3) Porous pavement with underground recharge
beds;
(4) Seepage pits, seepage trenches, or other
infiltration structures;
(5) Cisterns and underground reservoirs;
(6) Routed flow over grass;
(7) Grassed channels and vegetated strips;
(8) Roof-top storage; and
(9) Detention basins.
The use of other control methods that meet the criteria of
this Ordinance in this Section will be permitted when
approved by the Township Engineer. Various
combinations of methods should be tailored to suit the
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 60
particular requirements for the type of development and
the local site conditions.
6. Stormwater Recharge Systems Requirements
a. Determination of the requirements for recharge shall be
based on the portions of the site that are pervious prior to
development and the degree to which the development
will reduce the permeability of the site. A recharge
volume as required by Section 306.B.5.a.(2) is to be
provided.
Permeability of the site shall be based on Hydrologic Soil
Classifications derived from the Engineering Field Manual
from the Natural Resource Conservation Service of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The site should be evaluated early in the design process
so that the best soils for stormwater recharge system
locations can be identified prior to finalizing the site
design layout. The proposed layout and grading plan
shall not preclude potential BMP locations. Site
evaluation and soil infiltration testing shall follow the
guidelines of the BMP Manual, Appendix C, Protocol 1 as
amended. Where applicable, the infiltration rate shall be
adjusted by the reduction factor defined in Protocol 1 and
the safety factor defined in Protocol 2 of the BMP
Manual. In addition to the BMP Manual guidelines for
infiltration testing, the applicant shall provide the
following:
(1) All tests shall include the 24-hour presoak
procedure before testing. Presoaking is not
required when infiltrometer testing is conducted.
(2) Tests shall be conducted at the proposed bottom
elevation of an infiltration BMP. At a minimum, 2
tests per infiltration BMP or 1 test per 1,000
square feet of infiltration area, whichever is
greater, shall be provided.
(3) Soil analysis and infiltration test methods and test
locations shall be submitted to the Township
Engineer for review and approval prior to testing.
The Township Engineer shall observe all testing
and will require that specific test pits and
percolation data be obtained in order to approve
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 61
test result data and ensure that the proposed
infiltration systems will function as designed.
b. Design and Construction of Infiltration Systems shall
follow the guidelines of the BMP Manual Appendix C
Protocol 2, as amended, including, but not limited to, the
following:
(1) Site Conditions and Constraints
a) The lowest level of the infiltration area
should generally be at least two (2) feet
above limiting zones such as the Seasonal
High Water Table and bedrock. If less
than two (2) feet exists, filter media may
be employed to remove pollutants.
b) Infiltration BMPs should be sited so that
any risk to groundwater quality is
minimized, at least 50 feet from individual
water supply wells, and 100 feet from
community or municipal water supply
wells. Horizontal separation distances or
buffers may also be appropriate from
Special Geologic Features, such as
fractures, traces and faults, depending on
water supply sources.
c) Infiltration BMPs should be sited so that
they present no threat to sub-surface
structures, at least 10 feet down gradient
or 100 feet up gradient from building
basement foundations, and 50 feet from
septic system drain fields unless specific
circumstances allow for reduced
separation distances.
(2) Design Considerations
a) Do not infiltrate in compacted fill.
b) Provide a level infiltration area (1% slope
or less).
c) Adhere to the following maximum Loading
Ratios.
a. Maximum Impervious Loading
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 62
Ratio of 5:1 relating impervious
drainage area to infiltration area.
b. Maximum Total Loading Ratio of
8:1 relating total drainage area to
infiltration area.
d) Infiltration BMPs shall be designed so that
the drawdown time to completely empty
the BMPs should be between 1 and 3
days. No allowance for infiltration
occurring during the storm shall be
considered.
e) All infiltration systems shall be designed
with a positive overflow that discharges
excess volume in a non-erosive manner
and allows for controlled discharge during
extreme rainfall events or frozen bed
conditions. Infiltration BMPs should never
be closed systems dependent entirely
upon infiltration.
f) Water quality inlets, sumps, or other
sediment removal facilities shall be
provided to intercept sediments in
stormwater flowing over paved areas.
g) A minimum soil cover of 12 inches is to be
provided over subsurface infiltration beds
which do not underlay paving.
(3) Construction Requirements
a) During construction, protect infiltration
beds from compaction and prevent
sediment from washing into infiltration
BMPs.
b) Areas proposed for post-construction
BMPs may be utilized as a sediment trap
at an elevation 1.0 foot above the final
bottom of the bed.

shall be completed for the design-day
peak highway hour(s) and peak
development generated hour(s). In order
to obtain vehicle trip generation base data,
the traffic engineer shall consult either his
firm's data bank or the most current edition
of the Institute of Transportation Engineers
Trip Generation Report, or local data from
the Township or, if available, more current
or comprehensive sources. All turning
movements associated with the proposed
improvement generated hour(s) shall be
computed and contained in the study.
Traffic volumes generated by the
proposed use shall be distributed and
assigned to existing roadways and
intersections throughout the study area for
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003

which existing conditions were recorded.
Documentation of all assumptions used in
the distribution and assignment of traffic
shall be provided. Any characteristics of
the site that are likely to cause particular
traffic management problems shall be
noted.
(e) Analysis of Traffic Impact. The traffic
engineer shall identify the relationship of
the site-generated traffic associated with
the proposed development and overall
demand. This demand shall consist of a
combination of the existing traffic
expanded to the completion year (using
the annual traffic rate available from the
Delaware Valley Regional Planning
Commission), the development generated
traffic, and the traffic generated by other
proposed developments in the study area.
When considering the proposed
development, all future phases must be
included to evaluate the total traffic impact
of the development.
He shall further identify the development's
proportional relationship to the traffic
system improvements that are likely to be
required, in part, due to the development.
The volume/capacity analysis performed in
accordance with Section 306.D.4.a.(4)(c),
above, shall be updated to include a
volume/capacity analysis using the total
future demand and future roadway
capacity. The analysis shall be conducted
on a design day during the peak highway
hours(s) and on major intersections in the
study area which are projected to be
affected by the proposed development.
All access points and pedestrian crossings
shall be examined as to the need for and
feasibility of installing traffic signals or
other traffic control devices. To do this, the
traffic engineer shall evaluate access
points and pedestrian crossings pursuant
to the Pennsylvania Department of
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 87
Transportation specifications for traffic
signal warrants.
(f) Conclusions and Recommended
Improvements. All roadways and/or
intersections showing a level of service
which is deemed deficient by the traffic
engineer during peak hours of the day
(peak hour defined to include peak hour of
the day on the particular roadway and
peak hour of traffic of development
generated traffic) shall be identified.
Specific recommendations for the
elimination of traffic problems associated
with the proposed development shall be
identified. (Levels of service are defined in
the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual,
Highway Research Board, National
Academy of Sciences, Special Report 209,
as updated.) A listing of recommended
improvements shall include the following
elements: internal circulation design; site
access locations and design;
improvements and widenings; traffic signal
installation and operation, including signal
timing; transit design improvements; and
reduced intensities of uses. All physical
roadway improvements shall be shown as
a part of the report.
The listing recommending improvements
for vehicular, pedestrian/non-vehicular,
and transit modes shall include, for each
improvement, the party proposed to be
responsible for the improvement, the cost
and funding of the improvement (to the
extent possible) and the completion date
for the improvement (to the extent
possible).
In considering improvements related to
phased development, the improvements
related to each phase of development
shall be at a minimum those required to
eliminate traffic problems associated with
that phase and no improvements shall be
deferred which would have the effect of
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 88
not eliminating identified traffic problems if
the development were not completed.
The Township, with the assistance of its
own traffic engineer, shall review the
methodology, assumptions, findings, and
recommendations of the applicant's traffic
engineer. The Board may impose upon the
applicant additional improvements
deemed necessary to accommodate
impacts of the development.
b. Utilities Impact Study. A study shall be prepared by a
registered professional engineer indicating the likely
impact of the proposed development on the existing
sewer, water, groundwater, solid waste and drainage
systems serving East Pikeland Township. Said impact
analysis shall identify the existing capacity of facilities
which would serve the development, the prospects of
those facilities being able to provide service to it, and any
improvements that might be required as a direct result of
the proposed development.
Additionally, the study should identify the likely ability of
sewer, water, solid waste, and drainage systems to
continue to provide efficient and economic service to
existing residents and businesses within the Township
considering added service requirements of the proposed
development. The study shall indicate what alternatives
have been considered for sewage treatment and
disposal, as well as measures to be initiated toward
waste recycling and water conservation.
c. Fiscal Impact Studies. In addition to the applicable
development thresholds of Subsections 306.D.2, a fiscal
impact analysis shall be prepared for all conditional use,
special exceptions and proposed zoning changes
identifying the likely impact of the development on the
Township's tax structure and expenditure patterns.
Included shall be a determination of the revenues to
accrue to the Township as a result of the proposed
development, as well as an identification of the costs
associated with delivering service to the proposed
development. The fiscal impact analysis shall deal with
the impact of the proposed development on the ability of
the Township to deliver fire, police, administrative, public
works and utility services to the development of the
East Pikeland Township

Township, as specified in Section 310.C. of this Ordinance.
C. The applicant agrees to have prepared a deed(s) of such dedication to
the Township for such streets and for such easements for sanitary and
storm sewers, sidewalks, and other public improvements, provided that
the Township shall not accept dedication of such improvements until
their completion is certified as satisfactory to the Township Engineer.
D. Whenever an applicant proposes to establish or continue a street which
is not offered for dedication to public use, the Board of Supervisors shall
require the applicant to submit, and also to record with the plan, a copy
of an agreement made with the Board on behalf of himself and his heirs
and assigns, and signed by him, and which shall establish the
conditions under which the street may later be offered for dedication,
and shall stipulate among other things:
1. That an offer to dedicate the street shall be made only for the
street as a whole;
2. That the Township shall not be responsible for repairing or

or assigns; and
4. That, if dedication is to be sought, the street shall conform to
Township specifications or that the owners of the abutting lots
shall, at their own expense, restore the streets to conformance
with Township specifications.
SECTION 310 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES
A. The applicant shall deposit with the Township, financial security in an
amount sufficient to cover the cost of all improvements, both public and
private, and common amenities, including but not limited to streets,
walkways, shade trees, stormwater management facilities, recreational
facilities, open space improvements, buffer or screen plantings, or other
water supply facilities, fire hydrants, sanitary sewage disposal facilities.
Financial security related to public sewers shall be provided to the
Valley Forge Sewer Authority.
B. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Board of Supervisors shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plan or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial
improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of
contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the
financial security agreement is not executed within ninety (90) days,
unless a written extension is granted by the Board; such extension shall
not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the
request of the developer.
C. Financial security required herein shall be in the form of a Federal or
Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letter of credit, a
restrictive or escrow account in such institution, or with a financially
responsible bonding company, or such other type of financial security
which the Township may, in its reasonable discretion, approve. The
bonding company may be chosen by the party posting the financial
security, provided that the said bonding company or lending institution is
authorized to conduct business within the Commonwealth and stipulates
that it will submit to Pennsylvania jurisdiction and Chester County venue
in the event of legal action.
D. The said financial security shall provide for, and secure to the public, the
completion of any improvements which such security is being posted on
or before the date fixed in the approved subdivision plan and subdivision
agreement for completion of such improvements.
E. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 101
required improvements shall be equal to one hundred ten (110) percent
of the cost of completion estimated as of ninety (90) days following the
date scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually, the
Township may adjust the amount of the financial security by comparing
the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and
the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as
of the expiration of the ninetieth (90th) day after either the original date
scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment the Township may require the developer
to post additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals the said one hundred ten (110) percent. Any additional security
shall be posted by the developer in accordance with this section.
F. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by an applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Township, upon the recommendation of the Township Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant
or developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate,
then the estimate shall be recalculated and re-certified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable, and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of such engineer shall be
paid equally by the Township and the applicant or developer.
G. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one (1) year
from the date of posting the financial security to complete the required
improvements, the amount of financial security shall be increased by an
additional ten (10) percent for each one (1) year period beyond the first
anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount not
exceeding one hundred ten (110) percent of the cost of completing the
required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of
the preceding one (1) year period by using the above bidding procedure.
H. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plans by section
or stage of development, subject to such requirements or guarantees as
to improvements in the future sections or stages of development as it
finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
I. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party
posting the financial security may request the Board of Supervisors to
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended June 2, 2015 III - 102
release or authorize to be released, from time to time, such portions of
the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing
addressed to the Board of Supervisors, and the Board shall have
forty-five (45) days from receipt of such request within which to allow the
Township Engineer to certify, in writing, that such portion of the work
upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the
approved plans. Upon such certification, the Board shall authorize
release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as
estimated by the Township Engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed. The Township Engineer, in certifying the
completion of work for a partial release, shall not be bound to the
amount requested by the applicant, but shall certify to the Board his
independent evaluation of the proper amount of partial releases. The
Board may, prior to final release at the time of completion and
certification by the Township Engineer, require retention of ten (10)
percent of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
SECTION 311 COMMENCEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT

ARTICLE IV
DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS
SECTION 400 GENERAL
A. The following standards shall be complied with in all subdivision and land
development, and are intended as the minimum for the promotion of the
public health, safety and welfare. If an Applicant/developer, however, can
clearly demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that because of
peculiar physical conditions pertaining to his land, the literal enforcement of
these standards would cause undue hardship, such variations from their
literal interpretation may be permitted as may be reasonable and
consistent with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance subject to Section
704 of this Ordinance. Such variations shall represent the least change
from the standard.
B. All proposed subdivisions shall comply fully with the existing zoning
regulations applicable to the land, and no parcel of land shall be created,
either by inclusion or exclusion from a proposed subdivision, which cannot
be properly utilized for a permitted use under the existing zoning
regulations.
C. Physical improvements to the property being subdivided shall be provided,
constructed, and installed as shown on the Plan of Record, in accordance
with the requirements of the Township.
D. All improvements installed by the applicant shall be constructed in
accordance with the design specifications of the Township. Where there
are no applicable Township specifications, all such specifications are
subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
E. Applicants shall comply with design guidelines in the Zoning Ordinance
pertaining to the KR Kimberton Retail District, the C Commercial District,
and the MU Mixed-Use Development District, and with the design
guidelines of Ordinance 124 for development in Kimberton Village.
SECTION 401 LAND REQUIREMENTS
A. Land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be subdivided.
Proposed land developments shall be coordinated with existing nearby
neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may develop
harmoniously.
B. No land shall be developed for residential purposes unless all hazards to
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended March 12, 2014 IV - 2
life, health, or property from flood, fire, and disease shall have been
eliminated or unless the plans for the development shall provide adequate
safeguard against such hazards.
C. If, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, an applicant proposes
streets or building development which would unnecessarily destroy existing
tree growth, whether by reason of street alignment, grading or otherwise,
the Planning Commission shall either:
1. Refuse to recommend approval of the Preliminary Plan; or
2. Suggest alternate method of subdivision which would preserve as
many of the existing trees as possible which measure six (6) inches
in diameter and above; or
3. Recommend to the Board that, as a condition of their approval, the
developer be required to plant one (1) new tree of not less than two
(2) inch diameter for every existing tree measuring twelve (12)
inches in diameter and above, which would be destroyed, such new
trees to be planted on the lots and not as street trees, as directed
by the Board.
The purpose of this particular regulation shall be to maintain the supply of
natural vegetation, prevent erosion of the topsoil on the site and
surrounding properties, foster the retention of ground water supply and
generally promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens.
SECTION 402 LOT DESIGN
A. General Lot Design Standards
1. Lot dimensions, areas and orientation shall be appropriate for the
type of development and use contemplated, and sufficient to
provide satisfactory space for off-street parking and other
accessory uses.
2. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight
street lines, and radial to curved street lines and cul-de-sac
turnarounds.
3. Where feasible, lot lines shall follow municipal boundaries rather
than cross them, in order to avoid jurisdictional problems.
4. Where feasible, the depth of residential lots shall be not less than
one (1) nor more than three (3) times their width.

Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended March 12, 2014 IV - 3
B. Lot Frontage Standards
1. All lots shall have direct access to a public street, or to an approved
private street and where applicable shall have a frontage in
accordance with zoning standards, but shall have a minimum width
of fifty (50) feet where fronting directly on the street and in the case
of an interior lot, the required access strip shall have a minimum
width of twenty-five (25) feet connecting to a public or private street.
2. Any proposed lots abutting an existing or proposed arterial or
collector street in the Township shall be designed as reverse
frontage lots having access to the street with a lower function, as
required in Section 1409 of the Township Zoning Ordinance. This
requirement may be waived by the Board of Supervisors if, in its
judgment: i) the advantages to the Township of compliance with
this standard are outweighed by the applicant's resulting inability to
meet other requirements of this Ordinance or the Zoning
Ordinance; or ii) compliance would be unreasonable or impractical
due to the size of the proposed development, configuration of the
site, etc.
3. All residential lots using reverse frontage shall have a rear yard with
a minimum depth of seventy-five (75) feet, measured in the
shortest distance from the proposed dwelling unit to the proposed
right of way, and shall, within such rear yard and immediately
adjacent to the right of way, have a planting screen easement of at
least ten (10) feet in width, across which there shall be no right of
access.
4. No interior lot shall be permitted on the turnaround of a cul-de-sac.
C. Building Setback Lines
The minimum building setback line shall be in accordance with the East
Pikeland Township Zoning Ordinance but may be placed deeper on a
cul-de-sac (circular turnaround) lot in order to satisfy minimum lot width
requirements where the side lot lines are not parallel to each other.
D. Interior Lots
1. No more than two (2) contiguous interior lots shall be formed within
a proposed subdivision. The creation of such lots shall be
minimized and limited to those circumstances dictated by the
configuration of the site however the applicant shall not be
permitted to use interior lot design to avoid constructing or
extending streets.
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended March 12, 2014 IV - 4
2. No more than two (2) lots, one behind the other, shall be created
along a new or existing street. Access to any other lots shall be
taken directly from a new street.
3. An interior lot shall have an access strip, with a minimum width for
its entire depth of twenty-five (25) feet, and which meets the
minimum lot frontage requirements of this Ordinance. The access
strip shall be in addition to the minimum lot area requirements as
prescribed in the Township Zoning Ordinance.
E. Crosswalks
1. Crosswalks may be required by the Board of Supervisors to
facilitate pedestrian circulation and to give access to community
facilities where situations warrant concern for the safety and
welfare of Township residents.
2. Such crosswalks shall have a width of not less than ten (10) feet
and a paved walk of not less than four (4) feet.
SECTION 403 MONUMENTS AND MARKERS
A. Monument Standards
1. Permanent stone or concrete monuments shall be accurately
placed at the intersection of all lines forming angles and at changes
in directions of lines in the boundary (perimeter) of the property
being subdivided.
2. All monuments shall be placed by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor so that the scored point created by an
indented cross or drilled hole in the top of the monument shall
coincide exactly with the point of intersection of the lines being
monumented.
3. Monuments shall be set with their top level with the finished grade
of the surrounding ground.
4. All streets shall be monumented on the right of way line at the
following locations:
a. At least one monument at each intersection;
b. At changes in direction of street lines;
c. At each end of each curved street line, (e.g., points of
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended March 12, 2014 IV - 5
curvature and tangency); only one side of each street need
be monumented;
d. An intermediate monument wherever topographical or other
conditions make it impossible to sight between two (2)
otherwise required monuments; and
e. At such other places along the line of streets as may be
determined by the Township Engineer to be necessary so
that any street may be readily defined in the future.
5. Utility pipeline rights-of-way shall be monumented at all property
lines.
6. Common open space and community sewage disposal areas shall
be monumented.
B. Marker Standards
1. Markers shall be accurately placed at all lot corners within a
subdivision.

as have been officially prepared and adopted by the Township, including
recorded subdivision plans and the Comprehensive Plan of the Township.
B. Proposed streets shall further conform to such Township, County and
State road and highway plans as have been prepared, adopted and/or filed
as prescribed by law.
C. Thoughtful and imaginative design of streets and their relationship to the
arrangement and shape of lots is required. An important element is the
blending with topography to produce curvilinear design and reasonable
grades. The rectilinear design of streets and lots, involving long straight
sections of street, shall be avoided.
D. Local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage through traffic, but
provisions for street connections into and from adjacent areas may be
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended March 12, 2014 IV - 6
required.
E. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
thoroughfare, the Board may require dedication of additional right of way
specified hereinafter and marginal access streets, rear service alleys,
reverse frontage lots, or such other treatment as will provide protection for
abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with the major
thoroughfare and separation of local and through traffic.
F. New half or partial streets shall not be permitted except where essential to
reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other
requirements and standards of this Ordinance and where, in addition,
dedication of the remaining part of the street has been secured. Wherever
a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or partial street, the other
part of the street shall be plotted within such tract. Where half or partial
streets are proposed, the acceptance of final plans shall be conditioned
upon the provision of guarantees providing for the construction or
completion of such streets to Township standards. As an interim measure,
a temporary turnaround must be provided for half or partial streets.
G. Dead end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit future
street extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as cul-de-sacs and
shall be dedicated in accordance with Section 605 of this Ordinance.
H. Where streets and other public improvements continue into adjoining
municipalities, evidence of compatibility of design, particularly with regard
to street widths, shall be submitted. The applicant shall coordinate such
design with both municipalities to avoid abrupt changes in cartway width or
in improvements provided.
I. Where a proposed subdivision abuts an existing subdivision having a
dedicated residential street dead-ending at a common property line, the
proposed subdivision shall make provision for extension of such dedicated
residential street within the proposed subdivision for a distance of not less
than one (1) lot depth and connection with another street. In the design of
a proposed subdivision, provision shall be made for continuation of the
width, gradient, general alignment and direction of traffic flow of a collector
street that dead-ends at a common property line or is proposed in the
Township Comprehensive Plan whenever such proposal has been adopted
by resolution of the Board.
J. Where lots abut an existing street, additional right of way, paving and other
street improvements shall be required for such an existing street to the
extent deemed by the Board to be in the public interest.
K. If lots resulting from original subdivision are large enough to permit
resubdivision, or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, adequate street

Township for the following purposes:
1. To promote public safety and convenience.
2. To provide parking space in commercial districts and in areas of
high density residential development.
3. To accommodate special topographic circumstances which may
result in cut/fill slopes extending beyond the standard right of way in
all circumstances to assure accessibility for maintenance
operations.
C. Right of way of lesser width than prescribed in this section shall not be
permitted.

D. Subdivisions abutting existing streets shall provide the minimum right of
way widths for those streets in accordance with the provisions of this
section for dedication.
E. Where a subdivision abuts an existing street of improper cartway or right of
way width or alignment, the Township Supervisor shall require the
dedication of land sufficient to widen the street or correct the alignment
and require the escrow of money where deemed necessary in order to
improve said cartway.
SECTION 406 INCREASE OF RIGHT OF WAY WIDTHS
In the case where lots created within a subdivision are large enough to accommodate
either further subdivision, or a higher intensity of development, and thus may result in
higher traffic levels, the Township may require that additional right of way be provided to
permit the future development of a higher order street.
SECTION 407 STREET GRADES
A. There shall be a minimum centerline grade of one (1) percent. Centerline
grades shall not exceed the following:
Street Function Maximum Grade
Arterial 6%

turnaround portion of a cul-de-sac street measured from reverse curve to
reverse curve.
J. Where the turnaround right of way of a cul-de-sac street is placed adjacent
to the tract boundary, a fifty (50) foot right of way width shall be provided
along the boundary line to permit dedication and extension of a street at
full width in accordance with Section 605 of this Ordinance, un-less future
expansion of a cul-de-sac street is clearly impractical or undesirable. The
small triangles of land beyond the cul-de-sac to the boundary shall be so
deeded that maintenance of these corners of land will be the
responsibilities of the adjoining owners until the roadway is continued.
SECTION 411 ACCELERATION, DECELERATION AND TURNING LANES
A. Deceleration or turning lanes may be required by the Township along
existing and proposed streets whenever the Board determines such lanes

E. Trails
1. Purpose
The Board of Supervisors of East Pikeland Township has
determined that the provision of a Comprehensive Trail System, as
identified in the East Pikeland Township Open Space, Recreation
and Environmental Resources Plan, is an essential element in
meeting the recreational, as well as the transportation, needs of the
residents of the Township and that trails already existing in the
Township represent an important resource insofar as they form the
basis of such Comprehensive Trail System.
It is the purpose, therefore, of this Section to require the provision
of trails and/or trail links in all subdivisions and land development,
or a fee-in-lieu thereof and to prevent the loss and regulate the use
of existing trails.
2. Provision of Trails
In all subdivisions and land developments, provision shall be made
for the reservation and/or dedication of trail corridors and the
construction of trails in accordance with the Comprehensive Trail
System delineated in the East Pikeland Township Open Space,
Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan, or for the provision
of trail links to the system.
3. Maintenance of Trails
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended March 12, 2014 IV - 34

individual lot owners, a homeowners association or similar
entity, of an organization capable of maintenance
responsibilities, the Township shall require that such
responsibilities be established in perpetual covenants or
deed restrictions binding on the landowner’s successors in
interest and may further require that an initial maintenance
fund be established.
b. All trails shall be maintained to a standard determined by
usage. The Township shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to keep trails passable. A trail may be maintained
by a property owner when such maintenance does not
infringe upon passage by trail users. The Township shall
have the right to close a trail entirely, or to specific uses, in
cases of abuse of rules and regulations established for the
appropriate use of such trail.
4. Fee-In-Lieu of Trails
a. In all subdivisions and land developments wherein trails
have been identified, as part of the Comprehensive Trail
System, in the East Pikeland Township Open Space,
Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan, the
Applicant shall set aside land and construct such trails, or
shall set aside land and construct trail links. In such cases
that the Township determines a trail set-aside will not
contribute directly to the Township’s Comprehensive Trail
System, a fee-in-lieu for the acquisition, construction and
maintenance of trails shall be required.
b. A note shall be placed on the Final Plan stipulating the
amount of the fee as established by paragraph a, above.
c. The full amount of the fee shall be placed in escrow as a
condition of Final Plan approval. Payment of the fee for any
lot shall be made at any of the following points, whichever
occurs first: (i) at the time of conveyance of the lot; (ii) at the
time of application for a building permit; or (iii) at the time
any public improvements are offered for dedication.
d. All fees received pursuant to this Section shall be placed in
a special capital reserve fund created for trail acquisition,
construction and maintenance at locations consistent with
the Comprehensive Trail System as identified in the East
Pikeland Township Open Space, Recreation and
Environmental Resources Plan.

approved. No person may block the use of a trail or alter the
path thereof unless a plan for the relocation is submitted to
the Township. The plan shall be approved by the Board of
Supervisors upon recommendation of the Planning
Commission, which shall make its recommendation within
forty-five (45) days of the submission of an application for
trail relocation. No relocation shall be permitted if such

width of less than ten (10) feet. Properties within which trail
relocations are permitted shall maintain existing connections
to trials on adjacent properties.
b. Any existing trail is presumed to exist by prescriptive
easement with public entitlement to its perpetual use. The
Board of Supervisors may authorize the Township Solicitor,
in cases of disputes over the existence of a prescriptive
easement, to seek a judicial determination of fact by an
action at law or equity.
c. The Township shall maintain a map of existing trails that
shall indicate: (i) whether the easement of such trails has
been confirmed by grant, agreement or judicial decision; (ii)
the identification of the entity assuming responsibility for
maintenance of the trail; (iii) any restriction(s) on the use of

Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended March 12, 2014 IV - 47
or sidewalk shall be provided for review prior to the installation of
the structure.
2. No open gutters for conducting rainwater or drainage of any kind
will be permitted to run over the top of curbs or sidewalks. All
underground rain conductors shall be Schedule 40 PVC.
3. No persons or person, firm or corporation shall construct or repair
any curb, sidewalk, or gutters within the public right-of-way without
first applying for and obtaining a permit for the same from the
Township. No permit will be required for new curbing, gutters or
sidewalk to be constructed in an approved subdivision and/or land
development, which is to be installed by the developer.
B. Concrete Mix, Placement, Finishing, and Curing
1. All curbs, gutters and sidewalks as well as all driveways over
sidewalks shall be constructed of monolithic concrete. Said
concrete shall have a low slump with a maximum slump of four (4)
inches, a compressive strength of four thousand (4,000) pounds
per square inch (psi) in twenty eight (28) days, a low water-cement
ratio of forth-five hundredth (0.45) or less, entrained air of five (5) to
eight (8) percent total air content and a minimum cementitious
materials content of five hundred sixty-four (564) pounds per cubic
yard (lb/cu yd) of concrete. Certification for the concrete mix shall
be furnished if required by the Engineer. At the discretion of the
Township Engineer, certified test results can be required for a 28
day test.
2. Proper finishing practices shall be used. No finishing operation
shall be performed while there is excess moisture or bleeding water
on the concrete surface. No subsequent finishing operation after
bull floating shall be done until the concrete will sustain foot
pressure with only about one-quarter inch (1/4”) indentation. The
final finishing operation shall be to make a light broom finish.
3. The finished concrete shall be cured for at least seven (7) days
after placement. As soon as the concrete is hard, it shall be cured
by one or combination of:
(a) Moisten the concrete and cover it with waterproof paper of
polyethylene film weighted down around the edges to
prevent evaporation.
(b) The concrete shall be kept continuously wet with a sprinkler.
(c) The concrete shall be covered with burlap that is kept moist
by occasionally spraying with water.
(d) Liquid membrane-forming curing compound, meeting the
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended March 12, 2014 IV - 48
specifications of ASTM C309, Type 1, Classes A and B,
shall be sprayed onto the concrete surface prior to
temperatures below forty (40) degrees Fahrenheit. The
curing compound shall be a type that leaves no permanent
discoloration on the surface and does not interfere with the
application of any subsequent surface treatment.
The concrete shall air dry for at least thirty days prior to application
of deicer chemicals. If time does not permit this air drying, the
concrete surface shall be sealed with an approved breathable
surface treatment.
4. Cold Weather Precautions. If concrete is placed when the air
temperature is or is expected to be less than forty (40) degrees
Fahrenheit, the following procedures shall be followed:
(a) Use heated concrete so that temperature does not fall
below fifty (50) degrees Fahrenheit during placing, finishing
and curing.
(b) Keep the concrete warn when freezing is possible. Use
insulating blankets or a thick layer of dry straw. To keep the
straw dry and in place, cover it with canvas, waterproof
paper, or plastic sheeting.
(c) Protect slab edges and corners with extra acre, they are
most vulnerable to freezing.
During cold weather, high-early-strength concrete may be used to
speed setting and strength development. This can reduce the
curing period from seven (7) days to three (3) days, but the concrete
shall be kept at or above fifty (50) degrees Fahrenheit for these
three (3) days. The concrete shall then cool gradually to air
temperature to prevent thermal shock. Calcium chloride admixture
shall not be used.
5. Hot Weather Precautions. If concrete is placed when the air
temperature is or is expected to be above eight-five (85) degrees
Fahrenheit, the following procedures shall be followed:
(a) Use concrete that has been chilled during batching and
mixing.
(b) Dampen the subgrade and forms.
(c) Have enough manpower and equipment on hand to finish
the concrete quickly.
(d) Cover the concrete with wet burlap or plastic sheeting, and
expose only a small area at a time just ahead of finishers, or
use continuous wet curing methods.
(e) Start curing as soon as possible.

applicant shall, within ten (10) working days of the date of billing,
notify the Township that such expenses are disputed as
unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the Township shall

district in which the municipality is located (or if at the time there
be no President Judge, then the senior active judge then sitting)
shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither
the Township Engineer nor any professional engineer who has
been retained by, or performed services for, the Township or the
applicant within the preceding five (5) years.

the reasonable and necessary expense shall be paid by the
applicant if the amount of payment required in the decision is
equal to or greater than the original bill. If the amount of
payment required in the decision is less than the original bill by
$1,000 or more, the Township shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the Township and the

APPENDIX B
PROCEDURES FOR APPLICATIONS TO CONSTRUCT SEWERAGE FACILITIES
TO BE CONNECTED TO VALLEY FORGE SEWER AUTHORITY FACILITIES
The sewerage system built to extend sewerage services to new areas will serve the
public for many years. The system, after the warranty period, will become the property
of the Valley Forge Sewer Authority, and the Authority will maintain and operate it for
the use of the public.
The sewers carry waste into the Authority's interceptor and treatment plant. Measures
must be taken to protect sewers from damage or unnecessary loads as a result of
improper use or excessive infiltration into the system.
The following procedures are provided to insure that new sewerage facilities are
properly designed and installed. When followed, they will benefit the builder by
minimizing the expenditure of money during the warranty period for maintenance and
protect the public interests after the system is turned over to the Authority.
I. GENERAL
A. All plans must be prepared under the supervision of, or by a
Pennsylvania registered professional engineer acceptable to the
Authority, whose seal, signature and registration number shall appear
on each sheet of the plans.
B. All plans must meet the current requirements of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, and Valley Forge Authority.
C. Each application shall include a realistic estimate of cost of the
sewerage project (materials, cost of installation, engineering,
supervision and inspection; including excavation and restoration of
unpaved surfaces and re-paving of existing roads).
D. At the time of preliminary plan application, each applicant must include
a deposit of two (2) percent of the estimated cost of the sewerage
project against which will be charged any engineering and legal
expenses incurred by the Sewer Authority in checking the application,
processing permits, etc. The minimum fee is One Hundred Dollars
($100.00).
E. Each application shall include a time schedule for construction and
connection.
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended November 11, 2008 APPENDIX B - 2
F. Four (4) copies of all plans and other documents shall be submitted to
the Authority clerk via the Township at each stage of application.
G. The applicant must design and build the system to the point of
connection to Authority system. However, if Authority requires pipe
sizes for interceptor larger than that required for applicant, the Authority
will pay for difference in cost.
H. If any pumping stations are required, the Authority Engineer should be
consulted for plan requirements and for detailed specifications.
I. If sewage other than domestic waste is to be discharged, the following
is also required:
1. A detailed description of origin and nature of waste.
2. A process plan for pretreatment of waste to bring it to Authority
specifications and any applicable State and Federal
requirements.
3. A detailed plan for construction of the plant (consult the Authority
Engineer).
4. A detailed plan for operation of the plant and testing of effluent.
II. SUBMISSION OF PLANS
The submission of plans to the Valley Forge Sewer Authority for sewers to be
constructed in East Pikeland Township will follow the same general procedure
as those required for submission and approval of subdivision or land
development plans. The plan designations given below are intended to be
equivalent and comparable to the various stages of subdivision plans submitted
to the Township.
A. Sketch Plan
1. Copies of the subdivision sketch plan submitted to the Township
shall also be submitted to the Valley Forge Sewer Authority.
The plan submitted to the Authority shall show the approximate
sewer layout and the point of connection to the Authority's
system or ends of capped sewers. In all other respects, the plan
shall meet the requirements of the East Pikeland Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance for sketch plans.
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended November 11, 2008 APPENDIX B - 3
2. The principal purpose of the sketch plan is to provide the
Authority with information on proposed additions to the sewer
system and to afford the opportunity for the prospective
subdividers and the Authority to work out problems related to the
timing and location of service. This stage of planning is not
intended to provide information with regard to final location and
grades of sewers or design of pumping facilities.
B. Preliminary Plans
The preliminary plan shall include the preliminary design of sewerage
systems including, but not limited to, the locations and grade of sewers,
pumping stations and force-mains. In all other respects, the plan shall
meet the requirements of the East Pikeland Township Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance. With particular respect to the design of
sewer, the following requirements shall apply:
1. The Valley Forge Sewer Authority's datum shall be used for all
elevations.
2. Standard engineering symbols shall be used to designate the
various sewerage facilities.
3. The ground line profile shall represent the elevation along the
centerline of the proposed pipeline and should indicate where
final grade will differ from present grade. Preliminary profiles of
sewer lines may be shown in conjunction with preliminary street
profiles, or in the event of location of sewer lines on rights of
way, by separate plan.
4. The profile and plan shall be on the same sheet, corresponding
portions of the profile below the plan.
5. Existing and proposed utilities near the proposed sewer line shall
be shown on the plan and on the profile.
6. Basement and first floor elevations shall be shown on the profile
locations on the plan. These elevations may be shown as
approximate for proposed lot development.
7. Manholes shall be numbered in a systematic way, leaving space
available for the Authority Engineer to supply a three (3) or four
(4) digit prefix for each manhole number.
8. Lengths of runs between manholes shall be indicated, along with
slope (in %), and size and type of pipe.
East Pikeland Township
Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended November 11, 2008 APPENDIX B - 4
9. Special features, such as drop manholes, concrete encasement,
special bedding materials, waterproof manhole covers, special
fill, etc., shall be shown on the plan.
10. Invert elevations shall be indicated to two (2) decimal points.
11. Special paving or sod replacement shall be shown.
12. Where capped sewers are installed, the plans shall provide for
lateral connections for each lot extended to two (2) feet inside of
the property line for each lot.
13. Where connections for future use are required, the plan shall
provide for such connections to be laid to a point two (2) feet
behind the curb line of streets.
C. Final Plans
1. The final plans, which may be prepared in conjunction with final
subdivision plans, shall contain the completed design for all
sewers, pumping stations or other facilities required. They shall
be prepared in compliance with orders of the Authority resulting
from the review of preliminary plans.
2. If rights of way are involved, descriptions of such rights of way
shall be provided, along with information as to the record owners
of land involved. Before construction of any sewer systems is
authorized by the Authority, the applicant will be required to
submit executed rights of way in the form prescribed by the
Authority.
3. Final plans shall be accompanied by completed application
forms and modules prepared in the name of the Valley Forge
Sewer Authority as may be required to obtain the necessary
permits from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources or other State or Federal agencies.
4. Final application shall be accompanied by a deposit of fifteen
(15) percent of the project cost to pay for inspection during
construction; testing and inspection as construction is
completed; and infiltration, and, if necessary, TV inspection
during bond period, and TV inspection just prior to release of
bond. This fund is to be added to if needed or returned if not
expended completely. The minimum deposit is One Thousand
Dollars ($1,000.00).

Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance
As Amended May 20, 2003
As Amended November 11, 2008 APPENDIX B - 5
5. A performance and maintenance bond shall be submitted in a
form acceptable to the Authority for one hundred (100) percent
of the construction cost with a term of two (2) years after
Certification of Satisfactory Completion of Sewer Construction.
This Certificate will be issued by the Authority Engineer after
pressure testing and visual inspection of lines upon completion
of all construction in the project or approved section thereof.
6. Final applications shall include a Sewer Agreement acceptable
to the Authority, obligating the applicant to follow Valley Forge
Sewer Authority regulations and rules, to connect all sewer lines
and pumping stations to the system, to turn over the system to
the Authority without reservations, and to allow the Authority to
use the system as it wishes before turnover.
III. CONSTRUCTION PHASE
A. Resident inspection shall be at the discretion of the Authority. The
resident inspector shall have the authority to halt construction if he feels
construction is not being done according to specifications.
B. Each section between manholes and all force mains must be pressure
tested before any house connections are made. All sections and
manholes downstream of the house must be certified as acceptable by
Authority Engineer before any house connections can be made.
C. When the entire sewerage system is complete and found satisfactory
on test and visual inspection by Authority Engineer, a Certificate of
Satisfactory Completion of Sewer System Construction will be issued by
the Authority Engineer.
D. Each house connection must be inspected by plumbing inspector before
being back-filled. For houses going on line immediately, connection fee
must be paid and connection permit obtained before connection is
made. For capped sewers, testing will include laterals. House
connections shall be double-weight cast iron pipe. In capped sewer
developments, house connections are required only to the septic tank,
but should be located and arranged for eventual connection to the
sanitary sewer.
E. Material samples and material compliance statements shall be provided
at the request of the Authority Engineer.
F. One (1) reproducible copy of as-built drawings shall be provided to the
Authority.

ARTICLE I – GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 101. Short Title
This Ordinance shall be known as the “East Pikeland Township Grading, Erosion and Sediment
Control, and Stormwater Management Ordinance.”
Section 102. Statement of Findings
The Governing Body of the Municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance
and development throughout a watershed increases flooding, flows and velocities, contributes
to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream
communities, reduces infiltration and groundwater recharge, increases nonpoint source
pollution to waterways, and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance
and development throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the
natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of
stream beds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat,
and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of
recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including minimization of impacts of
New Development, Redevelopment, and other Earth Disturbance Activities causing
accelerated runoff and erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the Municipality and all of the people of
the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater
recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also protects and maintains
surface water quality.
E. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of stormwater
generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and
sustain high water quality, infiltration, stream baseflow, and aquatic ecosystems. Costeffective
and environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be achieved through the
use of nonstructural Site design techniques that minimize Impervious Surfaces, reduce
disturbance of land and natural resources, avoid sensitive areas (i.e., riparian buffers,
floodplains, steep slopes, wetlands, etc.), and consider topography and soils to maintain the
natural hydrologic regime.
7
Adopted April 2, 2014
Last Amended October 1, 2019
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater.
G. Federal and State regulations may require the Municipality to implement a program of
stormwater controls. The Municipality is required to obtain a permit from the PADEP and
comply with its provisions for stormwater discharges from its Separate Storm Sewer System
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
H. Non-stormwater discharges to municipal or other storm sewer systems can contribute to
pollution of the Waters of the Commonwealth.
Section 103. Purpose
The purpose of this Ordinance is to protect public health, safety and general welfare, property
and water quality by implementing drainage and stormwater management practices, criteria, and
provisions included herein for land development, construction and Earth Disturbance Activities,
to achieve the following throughout the Municipality:
A. Reduce the frequency and magnitude of flooding and stormwater impacts affecting people,
property, infrastructure and public services.
B. Sustain or improve the natural hydrologic characteristics and water quality of groundwater
and surface waters.
C. Protect natural resources, including riparian and aquatic living resources and habitats.
D. Maintain the natural hydrologic regime of Land Development Sites and their receiving
watersheds.
E. Minimize land disturbance and protect and incorporate natural hydrologic features, drainage
patterns, infiltration, and flow conditions within land development Site designs.
F. Reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated, and manage and release
stormwater as close to the source of runoff as possible.
G. Provide infiltration and maintain natural groundwater recharge to protect groundwater
supplies and stream baseflows, prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater
quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
H. Reduce stormwater pollutant loads to protect and improve the chemical, physical, and
biological quality of ground and surface waters.
I. Reduce scour, erosion and sedimentation of stream channels.
J. Protect adjacent and downgradient lands from adverse impacts of direct stormwater
discharges.
8
Adopted April 2, 2014
Last Amended October 1, 2019
K. Minimize Impervious Surfaces and connected Impervious Surfaces to promote infiltration
and reduce the volume and impacts of stormwater runoff.
L. Provide proper long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management facilities, BMPs and Conveyances that are implemented within the
Municipality.
M. Reduce the impacts of runoff from existing developed land undergoing Redevelopment while
encouraging New Development and Redevelopment in urban areas and areas designated for
growth.
N. Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program that addresses nonstormwater
discharges.
O. Provide performance standards and design criteria based on watershed-based stormwater
management planning.
P. Provide standards to meet certain NPDES stormwater permit requirements.
Q. Meet legal water quality requirements under State law, including regulations at 25 PA Code
Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the
Waters of the Commonwealth.
R. Implement the requirements of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDLs) where applicable to
waters within or impacted by the Municipality.
S. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and
management.
T. Fulfill the purpose and requirements of PA Act 167 (PA Act 167, Section 3):
“(1) Encourage planning and management of storm water runoff in each watershed which
is consistent with sound water and land use practices.
(2) Authorize a comprehensive program of stormwater management designated to
preserve and restore the flood carrying capacity of Commonwealth streams; to preserve
to the maximum extent practicable natural storm water runoff regimes and natural course,
current and cross-section of water of the Commonwealth; and to protect and conserve
ground waters and ground-water recharge areas.
(3) Encourage local administration and management of storm water consistent with the
Commonwealth's duty as trustee of natural resources and the people's constitutional right
to the preservation of natural, economic, scenic, aesthetic, recreational and historic values
of the environment.”

ARTICLE III – STORMWATER MANAGEMENT (SWM) STANDARDS
AND SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS
Section 301. Goals and Purpose
A. Goals. The goals for stormwater management in East Pikeland Township are:
1. To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the Township residents by protecting
the surface and groundwaters of the Township through effective stormwater management
and control of sedimentation and erosion, as provided in this chapter.
2. To limit the negative impacts of development that occur with inadequately managed
stormwater. These negative impacts include but are not limited to altered hydrology,
lowering of the groundwater table, physical stream impacts, and biological impacts to
nonpoint source pollutants.
B. Purpose. The purpose of stormwater management in East Pikeland Township is:
1. To maintain the predevelopment water balance in watershed and sub-watersheds
containing first-order and other especially sensitive streams in the Township, and to work
to restore natural hydrologic regimes wherever possible throughout the stream system;
2. To maintain the predevelopment volume of groundwater recharge;
3. To prevent increase in surface runoff volumes, predevelopment to postdevelopment,
thereby mitigating flooding downstream in the watershed, enlarging floodplains, eroding
streambanks, and creating other flood-related health, welfare, property losses, and to
work to reduce runoff volumes to natural levels;
4. To maintain predevelopment peak rates of discharge, site-by-site, so as not to worsen
flooding adjacent to downstream sites, and to work to restore peak runoff rates to natural
levels;
5. To minimize nonpoint source pollutant loading to groundwaters and surface waters
generally throughout East Pikeland Township;
6. To minimize impacts on stream temperatures;
7. To minimize aesthetic impacts; and
8. To manage stormwater through approaches and practices that rely on natural process to
the greatest extent possible and require a minimum of structures.

less than one (1) acre of Earth Disturbance, at the discretion of the Township Engineer,
reduced provisions may be established from those listed above in order to achieve
compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
S. The choice and design of stormwater management systems are to be developed through a
procedure that selects and locates Best Management Practices, viewing components in the
following priority:
1. Seeking to control runoff at its source through infiltration;
2. Improving the quality of the stormwater during conveyance;
3. Providing for detention.
T. The selection of a competent and creative design engineer by the applicant clearly is critical
to the success of an approach that emphasizes the use of Best Management Practices. In order
to achieve the standards and construction and maintenance cost reductions which are
intended in this chapter, additional time and money is required in the process in preliminary
engineering and design. Review and approval of the Stormwater Management Plan will be
heavily dependent on the technical review by the Township Engineer and compliance with
this chapter.
U. The applicant or applicant's agent shall design, construct and/or install drainage facilities to
prevent soil erosion, damage and siltation, and to manage stormwater in order to prevent the
impairment of public safety or physical damage due to concentration of the stormwater
runoff onto adjacent properties in accordance with this chapter and applicable rules and
regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and the Chester
County Conservation District. All land areas shall be graded to secure proper drainage away
from buildings, on-site sewage disposal systems, and to prevent the uncontrolled collection
of stormwater in pools. The system shall be designed to collect and recharge water to the
greatest extent possible.
V. The rate of stormwater runoff from any proposed subdivision, land development or
Regulated Activity that is not exempt per Section 106, shall not exceed the rate of runoff
prior to development. Requirements for design of stormwater management systems that
incorporate groundwater recharge as an essential element in order to control quantity of
discharge is outlined in this chapter. The distribution of drainage discharge from the
developed properties shall replicate that of before development conditions to the maximum
extent possible. The methodology and facilities used shall be based on the anticipated flows
and conditions of each particular site.

W. The Stormwater Management Site Plan for each subdivision, land development or Regulated
Activity that is not exempt per Section 106 shall take into account and provide for the peak
rate and volume flows of other areas in the watershed to ensure that cumulative problems are
not increased as a result of flows from the proposed project. This analysis shall also explore
possibilities to share stormwater management facilities with other areas in the watershed, in
which case, consultation with the Township shall be required prior to design.
X. Recharge facilities, detention facilities, storm sewers, culverts, bridges and related drainage
installation shall be designed and constructed to meet the following purposes:
1. To permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses. Such flow may be redirected as
required, subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection;
2. To insure adequate drainage of all low points as may be related to streets;
3. To intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals reasonably related to the extent
and grade of the area drained to prevent flow of stormwater across intersections during
the design storm;
4. To insure adequate and unimpeded flow of stormwater under driveways in, near, or
across natural watercourses or drainage swales. Properly sized pipes or other conduits
shall be provided as necessary;
5. To prevent excessive flow on or across streets, sidewalks, drives, parking areas, and any
other paved surface or accessway; and
6. To lead stormwater away from springs.
Y. All natural streams, channels, swales, drainage systems, and/or areas of concentration of
surface water shall be maintained in their existing condition, unless alteration is approved

that conservation measures are adequate and that all federal and state requirements are
satisfied.
CC. The Township may require that a landowner or development provide reasonable corrective
measures to alleviate any existing site conditions that cause and create drainage problems
off-site which may be affected by the proposed subdivision, land development or earth
disturbance. It shall be the responsibility of the landowner or developer to obtain all
drainage easements on, over, or through other properties, and the Township, its agents,
workmen, and employees shall be indemnified and held harmless from any liability.
DD. Any water originating from non-natural sources, such as swimming pools, air-conditioning
units, sump pumps, roof drains, or other similar flow, shall be properly discharged into a

IX.
EE. Any water originating from non-natural sources, as referenced above, shall not be
discharged onto any street or other public right-of-way used for pedestrian or vehicular
access. See also Article IX.
FF. To mitigate the potential polluting of surface waters and groundwaters by pollutants such as
salt, petroleum products, and antifreeze flowing from paved parking lots, pretreatment of
the runoff shall be required. The extent of the treatment shall be set by the Township
Engineer and will be determined by such factors as the area of the parking lot and the
course of the runoff as it is recharged or flows into natural waterways.

discharge from, or may be impacted by the proposed Regulated Activity.
B. Second, provide a prioritized listing of these resources and features to identify:
1. Those to be incorporated into the Site design in a manner that provides protection from
any disturbance or impact from the proposed Regulated Activity;
2. Those to be protected from further disturbance or impact but for which the proposed
Regulated Activity will provide improvement to existing conditions;
3. Those that can be incorporated into and utilized as components of the overall Site design
in a manner that protects or improves their existing conditions while utilizing their
hydrologic function within the limits of their available capacity (e.g., for infiltration,
evapotranspiration, or reducing pollutant loads, runoff volume or peak discharge rates,
etc.) to reduce the need for or size of constructed BMPs; and

existing topography in order to evenly distribute runoff and minimize concentrated
flows;
8. Minimize the cumulative area to be covered by Impervious Surfaces and:
a. Minimize the size of individual Impervious Surfaces,
b. Separate large Impervious Surfaces into smaller components,
c. Disconnect runoff from one Impervious Surface to another, and
d. Utilize porous materials in place of impervious wherever practicable;

overall Site design and selection, location and design of features and BMPs to be used to
comply with the requirements of Sections 305, 306 and 308.
Section 305. Peak Rate Controls, Water Quality and Runoff Volume Requirements
A. To control Post-construction stormwater impacts from Regulated Activities and meet State
water quality requirements, BMPs shall be provided in the Site design that replicate
Predevelopment stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, such that Post-construction
stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of
the receiving waters. The Applicant shall comply with the following peak rate, water quality
and runoff volume requirements for all Regulated Activities, including all New Development
and Redevelopment activities:
1. Standard 1: Recharge Volume - In addition to the control of the rate of stormwater runoff,
the volume of runoff from any proposed earth disturbance, grading, subdivision or land
development, assuming full development, shall be based on either the sum of subsections
a. and b. that follow or on subsection c) as applicable:
a. Recharge requirements are set at a volume of a minimum of three (3) inches or runoff
from the area of new and additional Impervious Surface. This is equal to the runoff
of a two (2) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm (3.22 inches of rainfall), plus
b. To the extent that a site is made less pervious by development (re-grading,
recompaction, loss of vegetation, or any land disturbance), but not made totally
impervious, a recharge volume requirement of a minimum of one (1) inch of runoff
from all areas of disturbed earth is required as well.
c. In the MU Mixed Use Development and the C Commercial Zoning Districts only (as
shown on the Township Zoning Map) for Sites containing areas of Redevelopment, a
recharge volume requirement of a minimum of one (1) inch of runoff from all areas
of Proposed Impervious Surface shall be provided rather than the criteria of
subsections a. and b. above.
Runoff volumes shall be calculated using the Soil Cover Complex Method of the NRCS.
The applicant is required to include these calculations in the volume requirements to be
accommodated by the stormwater management system. Infiltration systems shall be
designed such that failure of the infiltration component does not eliminate compliance
with the required peak rate attenuation capability of the BMP.

Last Amended October 1, 2019
2. Standard 2: Assuming full compliance with Standard 1, the peak flow rate of the postconstruction
design storm shall be reduced to the peak flow rate of the corresponding predevelopment
design storm set forth below. Rainfall depths shall be based on NOAA
Atlas 14 values, as amended and are estimated below. Design storms include:
Post-Construction Design
Storm Frequency
(24-Hour Duration)
Rainfall Depths
(inches)
Pre-Development Design
Storm Frequency
(24-Hour Duration)
1-year 2.67 0.75% (0.75) of the 1-year
2-year 3.22 1-year
10-year 4.70 2-year
25-year 5.67 25-year
50-year 6.49 50-year
100-year 7.36 100-year
The above design criteria are in addition to all required groundwater recharge
requirements. Infiltration system storage volume shall not be used as part of the storage
volume necessary to achieve the above listed peak rate attenuation requirements.
3. Standard 3: In the MU Mixed Use Development and the C Commercial Zoning Districts
only (as shown on the Township Zoning Map), the following peak flow rate design
criteria shall apply to areas of Redevelopment:
Post-Construction Design
Storm Frequency

a. At the discretion of the Municipal Engineer, Regulated Activities that involve a
combination of both New Development and Redevelopment activities may either:
(1) Apply the stormwater standards (Redevelopment or New Development) that are
associated with the activity that involves the greatest amount of land area; or
(2) Apply the Redevelopment and New Development stormwater standards to the
corresponding Redevelopment and New Development portions of the proposed
Regulated Activity.

4. Standard 4: Under certain conditions, the Township, upon recommendation of the
Township Engineer, may impose the following additional restrictions on stormwater
discharges:
c. Peak discharge may be further restricted when it can be shown that a probable risk to
downstream structures or unique natural areas exists or that existing severe flooding
problems could be further aggravated.
d. Measures shall be imposed to protect against ground or surface water pollution
where the type of business activity may result in significant nonpoint source pollution
("hot spots") or the nature of the soils or bedrock underlying a stormwater
management structure constitutes substantial risk of contamination, such as might be
the case in limestone formations. Special provisions to be followed in these cases will
be provided by the Township Engineer.
e. Where groundwater yields are very low or where a groundwater supply already is
heavily used, the Township may require that the entire volume of the two-year
frequency rainfall (3.3 inches in 24 hours) be retained and infiltrated.
5. Standard 5: Significant loadings of nonpoint source pollutants shall not be discharged
into either surface water or groundwater. Significant is defined as resulting in an increase
greater than 10% of existing background concentrations of all water quality parameters of
consequence identified in federal and state criteria for the watershed. In particular,
nutrients (nitrate and total phosphorus), metals (cadmium and lead), total petroleum
hydrocarbons (PH) and synthetic organic compounds identified by the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as toxic or hazardous substances must be controlled. If the
volume and peak rate standards above (Standards 1 and 2) are met, then water quality
impacts are assumed to be adequately controlled. If the volume standard (Standard 1)
above cannot be achieved, then a water quality impact analysis must be performed, at the
direction of the Township Engineer, confirming prevention of any significant increase in
nonpoint source pollution, with particular focus on the pollutants discussed above. Both
structural and nonstructural (preventive) measures are to be considered for reduction and
prevention of nonpoint source pollution.
B. For modeling purposes, the Predevelopment ground cover conditions shall be determined
using the corresponding ground cover assumptions presented in Subsection 307.D of this
Ordinance.
C. The design of the facility outlet shall provide for protection from clogging and unwanted
sedimentation.
D. BMPs that moderate the temperature of stormwater shall be used to protect the temperature
of receiving waters.
48
Adopted April 2, 2014
Last Amended October 1, 2019
E. Runoff from the Disturbed Area shall be treated for water quality prior to entering existing
waterways or water bodies. If a stormwater management practice does not provide water
quality treatment, then water quality BMPs shall be utilized to provide pre-treatment prior to
the runoff entering the stormwater management practice.
F. The Municipality may require additional water quality and runoff control measures for
stormwater discharging to special management areas such as those listed in Subsection
302.P.
G. When the Regulated Activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas, the water
quality and runoff volume shall be separately addressed for each drainage area.
H. Weighted averaging of runoff coefficients shall not be used for manual computations or input
data for water quality and runoff volume calculations.
I. Areas located outside of the Site (i.e., areas outside of the Regulated Activity) that drain
through a Site are not subject to peak rate control requirements, water quality and runoff
volume requirements.
J. Water quality and volume control practices shall be selected and designed to meet the criteria
of Subsection 304.C that apply to water quality and volume control.
K. When designing detention or retention facilities to control peak rates of runoff, storage
volume that is required to meet water quality or infiltration volume requirements, shall not be
included as part of the storage volume designed to control peak rates of runoff. Failure of an
infiltration facility, at any point in time, shall not adversely affect necessary peak flow rate
alternation.
L. Stormwater Distribution - The distribution of runoff from the developed property onto
adjacent properties shall, to the maximum extent possible, be in the same direction as that
which existed before development. No new concentrations of stormwater discharge will be
permitted.
Section 306. Stream Channel Protection Requirements
For Regulated Activities involving New Development with one (1) or more acres of Earth
Disturbance, the Applicant shall comply with the following stream channel protection
requirements to minimize stream channel erosion and associated water quality impacts to the
receiving waters:
A. The peak flow rate of the Post-construction two (2)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour design
storm shall be reduced to the Predevelopment peak flow rate of the one (1)-year, twentyfour
(24)-hour duration precipitation, using the NRCS Type II distribution.
49
Adopted April 2, 2014
Last Amended October 1, 2019
B. To the maximum extent practicable, and unless otherwise approved by the Municipal
Engineer, the Post-construction one (1)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm flow shall be
detained for a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours and a maximum not to exceed seventytwo
(72) hours from a point in time when the maximum volume of water from the one (1)-
year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm is stored in a proposed BMP (i.e., when the maximum
water surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water can begin at the start of
the storm (i.e., the invert of the orifice is at the invert of the proposed BMP).
C. For modeling purposes, the Predevelopment ground cover conditions shall be determined
using the corresponding ground cover assumptions presented in Subsection 307.D of this
Ordinance.
D. The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be three (3) inches in
diameter unless otherwise approved by the Municipal Engineer, and a trash rack shall be
installed to prevent clogging. For Sites with small drainage areas contributing to the BMP
that do not provide enough runoff volume to allow a twenty-four (24) hour attenuation with
the three (3)-inch orifice, the calculations shall be submitted showing this condition.
E. When the calculated orifice size is below three (3) inches, gravel filters (or other methods)
are recommended to discharge low-flow rates subject to the Municipal Engineer’s
satisfaction. When filters are utilized, maintenance provisions shall be provided to ensure
filters meet the design function.
F. All proposed stormwater facilities shall make use of measures to extend the flow path and
increase the travel time of flows in the facility.
G. When a Regulated Activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas, the peak flow
rate control shall be separately addressed for each drainage area.
Section 307. Calculation Methodology
A. Stormwater runoff from all Regulated Activity Sites with a drainage area of greater than one
(1) acre shall be calculated using a generally accepted calculation technique(s) that is based
on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method. Table 307.1 summarizes acceptable
computation methods. The method selected for use shall be based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular Site. The use of the Rational
Method to estimate peak discharges for drainage areas greater than one (1) acre shall be
permitted only upon approval by the Municipal Engineer. The runoff volume requirements
of this Ordinance shall always be based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method.

Section 308. Infiltration Requirements
Providing for infiltration consistent with the natural hydrologic regime is required to compensate
for the reduction in the recharge that occurs when the ground surface is disturbed or Impervious
Surface is created or expanded. The Applicant shall achieve the following infiltration
requirements:
A. Infiltration devices shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site conditions.
Measures may include porous pavement with underground infiltration beds, vegetated

the loss.
D. When a project contains or is divided by multiple watersheds, the infiltration volume shall be
separately addressed for each watershed.

minimum shall address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The
general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be conducted by a qualified Licensed
Professional and shall be consistent with the PA BMP Manual (as amended) (or other
guidance acceptable to the Municipal Engineer) and in general shall:
1. Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made features within the Site
to determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations
of sub-grade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without conducting these tests.

2. Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or other hydraulic conductivity tests
(at the elevation of the proposed infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate
hydraulic conductivity rate. Standard septic/sewage percolation tests are not acceptable
for design purposes.
3. Design the Infiltration Facility for the required retention (infiltration) volume based on
field-determined infiltration capacity (and apply safety factor as per applicable design
guidelines) at the elevation of the proposed infiltration surface.
4. On-lot infiltration features are encouraged; however, it shall be demonstrated to the
Municipal Engineer that the soils are conducive to infiltration on the identified lots.
5. Tests shall be conducted at the proposed bottom elevation of an infiltration BMP. At a

whichever is greater, shall be provided.
6. Soil analysis and infiltration test methods and test locations shall be submitted to the
Township Engineer for review and approval prior to testing. The Township Engineer
shall observe all testing and will require that specific test pits and percolation data be
obtained in order to approve test result data and ensure that the proposed infiltration
systems will function as designed.
G. Infiltration BMPs shall be selected based on suitability of soils and Site conditions and shall
be constructed on soils that have the following characteristics:
1. A minimum depth of twenty-four (24) inches between the bottom of the BMP and the top
of the Limiting Zone. If less than twenty-four (24) inches exists, filter media may be
utilized to remove pollutants.
2. An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater volume and drain
completely as determined by field tests conducted by the Applicant.
3. The Infiltration Facility shall completely drain the retention (infiltration) volume within
three (3) days (seventy-two (72) hours) from the end of the design storm. No allowance
for infiltration during the storm shall be considered.
H. All infiltration practices shall:
1. Be selected and designed to meet the criteria of Subsection 304.C that are applicable to
infiltration;
2. Additional Setbacks. Recharge facilities serving only one dwelling unit shall be sited at
least ten (10) feet from any property line, twenty-five (25) feet from all buildings, fifty
(50) feet from any water supply well, and twenty-five (25) feet from any wastewater
treatment of wastewater treatment system replacement area. All other recharge facilities,
including, but not limited to, those serving non-residential uses or more than one
residential dwelling unit shall be sited at least 50 feet from a property line, 50 feet down

gradient or 100 feet up gradient from a basement wall, 50 feet from septic system
drainfields, 50 feet from individual water supply wells and 100 feet from community or
municipal water supply wells.
3. For any infiltration practice that collects runoff from shared or multiple features and that
is located within fifty (50) feet of a building or feature with sub-grade elements (e.g.,
basements, foundation walls, etc.), the bottom elevation shall be set below the elevation
of the sub-grade element.
I. Infiltration Facilities, to the maximum extent practicable, shall be located to avoid
introducing contaminants to groundwater:
1. When a Hotspot is located in the area draining to a proposed Infiltration Facility, an
evaluation of the potential of groundwater contamination from the proposed Infiltration
Facility shall be performed, including a hydrogeologic investigation (if necessary) by a
qualified Licensed Professional to determine what, if any, pre-treatment or additional
design considerations are needed to protect groundwater quality.
2. When located within a “well head protection area” of a public water supply well,
infiltration practices shall be in conformance with the applicable approved source water
protection assessment or source water protection plan.
3. The Applicant shall provide appropriate safeguards against groundwater contamination
for land uses that may cause groundwater contamination should there be a mishap or
spill.
J. During Site construction, all infiltration practice components shall be protected from
compaction due to heavy equipment operation or storage of fill or construction material.
Infiltration areas shall also be protected from sedimentation. Areas that are accidentally
compacted or graded shall be remediated to restore soil composition and porosity. Adequate
documentation to this effect shall be submitted to the Municipal Engineer for review. All
areas designated for infiltration shall not receive runoff until the contributory drainage area
has achieved final stabilization.
K. Where sediment or debris transport in the stormwater runoff is anticipated to reach the
Infiltration Facility, appropriate permanent measures, as determined by the Municipal
Engineer, to prevent or collect sediment shall be installed prior to discharge to the infiltration
system. Measures may include settlement or filtration devices. Where Infiltration Facilities
are proposed that do not include permanent easily maintainable sediment and debris filtration
systems, they shall be designed to allow easy access by persons and equipment to remove

Walls.
A. Retaining Walls - All retaining walls shall be designed and approved in accordance with the
following:
1. Retaining walls to support the face of excavation shall not exceed a maximum height of
five (5) feet or a stepped level or terraced retaining wall system with a combined
maximum height of ten (10) feet.
2. Retaining walls greater than three and one-half (3½) feet in height shall have a protective
pedestrian guard fence meeting the specification of the Township Building Code.
3. All retaining walls shall be designed by a Pennsylvania registered professional engineer
whose signature and seal shall appear on the Final Plan. In-lieu-of a seal on the final
plan, final plans may contain a note deferring the professional design to a later Shop
Drawing submittal to be reviewed and considered for approval by the Municipal
Engineer.
4. Developers or Applicants shall be required to retain the services of a professional
geotechnical engineer to inspect construction of all retaining walls for compliance with
the Township approved design drawings. This geotechnical engineer shall provide a
written certification to the Municipality that all retaining walls were constructed in
accordance with the design plans prior to final Municipality approval of the
improvements.
B. No excavation or fill shall be made with an exposed face steeper in slope than three
horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the following conditions:
1. The material in which the excavation or fill is to be made is sufficiently stable to sustain a
slope of steeper than three horizontal to one vertical, and a written statement to that
effect by a licensed professional engineer experienced in erosion control is submitted and
approved by the Township Engineer. The statement shall certify that the site has been
inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified will not result in injury to
persons or damage to property or increased erosion and resulting sedimentation.
2. The Municipal Engineer may require a flatter slope when it is found that the material in
which the excavating is to be made is unusually subject to erosion or if other conditions
exist which make such a shallower slope necessary for stability and safety.
85
Adopted April 2, 2014
Last Amended October 1, 2019
C. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be located at least five (5) feet from property lines or
from any ultimate right-of-way, whichever is more restrictive, in order to permit a gradual
rounding of the edge without encroaching onto the abutting property. At property lines where
resulting slopes are steeper than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical or a retaining wall
system is three feet or more in height, a protective fence shall be located on top of the slope
or retaining wall system. The fence shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in height.
D. Excavation shall not exceed below the angle of repose or natural slope of the soil under the
nearest point of any footing or foundation or any existing building or structure unless such
footing or foundation is first properly underpinned or protected against settlement.
E. Grading shall not redirect or concentrate surface water onto an adjacent property.
F. During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control to prevent particulate matter
from becoming airborne shall be followed. These measures shall include, but not be limited
to the following:
1. A tire cleaning area shall be provided at each point of egress from the development areas;
2. Use, where possible, of water or other method approved by the Township Engineer for
control of dust during any land disturbance activity; and
3. Prompt removal of earth or other material from paved streets.
G. Grading equipment shall not be allowed to cross permanent or intermittent streams without
first obtaining appropriate permits or approvals from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
H. No applicant shall engage in land disturbance activities that endanger any adjoining property,
public street, sidewalk, alley or other property from settling, cracking or other damage which
might result from such land disturbance. If, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, the land
disturbance would create a hazard to life or property unless adequately safeguarded, the
applicant shall construct walls, fences, guard rails, or other structures to safeguard the
adjoining property, public street, sidewalk, alley, or other property and persons.
I. Excavations or fills shall not encroach on natural watercourses, floodplain areas, constructed
channels, or wetlands without the necessary state and federal permits. Excavations or fills
located adjacent to natural watercourses or constructed channels shall have suitable
protection against erosion. Excavation and fill shall comply with the maximum disturbance
standards contained in the Zoning Ordinance.
J. All fill shall be compacted to provide stability of material and to prevent undesirable
settlements. The fill shall be spread in a series of layers, not exceeding twelve (12) inches in
thickness, and be compacted by a sheepsfoot roller or other approved method after each layer
is spread. The Municipal Engineer may require compaction tests and reports.

K. Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface waters from damaging the cut face of
an excavation or the sloping surface or a fill within the area of a proposed subdivision or land
development. Slopes of more than ten (10) feet in vertical height shall be separated by level
berms of at least four (4) feet in width within which ditches shall be constructed where
necessary to prevent erosion and as a safe place to deposit and receive such water. The
Municipal Engineer may require such drainage structures or pipes to be constructed or
installed which are perceived necessary to prevent erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry
off surface waters.
L. When excavation or fill is proposed, all retaining walls, cribbing, drainage structures, fences
or other protective devices shall be maintained in good condition and repair.
M. All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide property drainage away from buildings,
and to dispose of water without ponding. All land within a development shall be graded to
drain and dispose of surface water without ponding, except where ponding as in the case of
detention basins, is part of the stormwater management system for the proposed subdivision
or land development.
N. All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately handle the surface runoff and
carry it to the nearest suitable outlet. Where drainage swales are used to direct surface waters
away from buildings, they shall be sodded or planted as required.
O. If load-bearing fill is proposed, a soils investigation report shall be submitted which shall
consist of test borings, laboratory testings and engineering analysis to correlate surface and
subsurface conditions with the proposed grading plan. The results of the investigation shall
include: data regarding the nature, distribution and supporting ability of existing soils and
rocks on the site; conclusions and recommendations to ensure stable soil conditions, and
groundwater control, as applicable. The Township may require such supplemental reports
and data as is deemed necessary by the Township Board of Supervisors or it's designated
official.
1. Fills toeing out on natural slopes steeper than three horizontal to one vertical shall not be
made unless approved by the Municipal Engineer after receipt of a report by a registered
professional engineer, qualified in soils analysis, certifying that he has investigated the
property, made soil tests and that, in his opinion, such steeper slopes will safely support
the proposed fill. The Municipal Engineer need not approve such fills if there is reason to
believe, e.g., due to a report from similarly qualified registered professional engineer, that
such steeper slopes will not safely support the proposed fill.
2. Natural and/or existing slopes exceeding five horizontal to one vertical shall be benched
or continuously stepped into competent materials, as determined by the Municipal
Engineer, prior to placing all classes of fill.

Frequently Asked Questions
Minor Stormwater Management Plan (Minor SWM Plan)
per Sections 106.D & E of this Ordinance
What activities come under Minor SWM Plan requirements?
Per the East Pikeland Township Stormwater Ordinance, Section 106.D, activities with between
500 and 1500 sq. ft. of impervious surface or between 2000 and 5,000 sq. ft. earth disturbance
may use Minor SWM Plan requirements. Per Section 106.E, agricultural structures up to 10,000
sq. ft. plus another 5000 sq. ft. of adjoining parking/movement area may use Minor SWM Plan
requirements. See the Stormwater Ordinance for more detail.
What’s a Best Management Practice (BMP)?
A BMP is a facility constructed to manage stormwater impacts by providing water quality
treatment, groundwater recharge through infiltration, volume reduction and peak rate control.
BMPs include but are not limited to those listed and shown in the Minor SWM Plan, BMP
Worksheets (Worksheets) that follow. See the Stormwater Ordinance definition of BMP for
more detail.
Do I require professional services to meet these requirements?
No. The goal of the Worksheets is to allow the individual to complete the calculations showing
compliance with the infiltration goals of the Stormwater Ordinance, also your contractor may
complete the Worksheets for you. If the steps presented in the Worksheets are able to be
followed, the individual does not require professional services; however, the information is
technical in nature so please call for assistance if necessary.
What do I need to Submit?
The items to be submitted are:
• Grading Permit Application with fee
• Minor SWM BMP Worksheets including Site Sketch Plan
• Operation, Maintenance & Inspection Plan & Agreement for Minor SWM Plan
Basic information is needed regarding the proposed activity and the BMP(s) chosen to manage
the stormwater runoff, including but not limited to the types of materials used, total impervious
areas and volume calculations. Completion of the Worksheets will provide the needed
information. In addition, a simple Site Sketch Plan (see example) showing the location of
following features (existing and proposed) shall be submitted:
a. structures, driveways and other paved surfaces (all impervious areas) with approximate
dimensions in feet,
b. BMPs,
c. erosion control measures, and
d. on-site septic system & wells (potable) showing rough proximity to infiltration facilities.
Completing the Worksheets and submitting them with the Grading Permit application should
provide sufficient information for review for compliance with the requirements.

Stormwater management design for earth disturbance activities qualifying under Section 106 as Minor
Stormwater Plans must address the intent of the SW Ordinance by managing the increase in runoff
through infiltration facilities. To determine the size of infiltration facilities, utilize a factor of 0.083 times
the impervious area. This reflects the infiltration of one (1) inch of stormwater runoff from the impervious
surfaces (in feet).

provided to release the larger storm volumes. The spillway should be located such that any down slope
problems are avoided when water is flowing over it. The spillway should be lined with a permanent
erosion mat to prevent deterioration. The spillway should be located as far away as possible from any
inflow pipes to promote infiltration and settling of stormwater runoff contaminants. The basin needs to be
planted with vegetation that is tolerant of the wet conditions that will occur. The depth of the basin may
be increased with the approval of the Township Engineer.
Determination of Water Quality Volume provided:
1
Area – L (length) x W (width) for rectangular basins
estimate for irregular shapes
sq. ft.
2 Depth of Basin = D ft.
3 Volume = Area x D (Line 1 x Line 2) (assuming straight sides) cu. ft.
4 Side Slope Factor “Z” – Use 3 for 3:1 slope, 4 for 4:1 slope, etc
5 Approx. Additional Volume = (L+W) x Z x D x D cu. ft.

TOTAL VOLUME PROVIDED (Line 3 + Line 5)
(Use this number in Step Three)
cu. ft.
A-8
BMP #2 –INFILTRATION BED
An infiltration bed can be used where surface stormwater runoff does not need to be captured. Roof drains
from the proposed structure are piped into an underground area to infiltrate into the ground. An overflow
pipe is provided to release the larger storm volumes. A cleanout is provided to facilitate maintenance and
provide an inspection port. The pipe within the bed is perforated and should be run through the basin to
the fullest extent to promote infiltration and distribution of the stormwater. Additional pipe can be utilized
within the bed to increase the available storage volume. The soil over the bed shall be planted with
vegetation that will not interfere with the operation of the bed. The depth of the bed may be increased
with the approval of the Township Engineer.
Note: AASHTO No. 4 is approximately 1-2 inch stone
Determination of Water Quality Volume provided:
1 Area – L (length) x W (width) sq. ft.
2 Depth of Bed = D ft.
3 Volume = Area x D (Line 1 x Line 2) (stone not considered) cu. ft.

TOTAL VOLUME PROVIDED
(Use this number in Step Three)
cu. ft.
If additional perforated pipe is used in the bed, volume may be adjusted accordingly.
A-9
BMP #3 –INFILTRATION TRENCH
Infiltration trenches are utilized along the perimeter of impervious surfaces to collect, store and infiltrate
stormwater runoff. River rock or equivalent will be placed on the bed to allow the stormwater runoff to
enter the trench; alternately the bed may utilize a perforated pipe with inlets to get the stormwater into the
trench. When on a slope, the trench is constructed as a terraced system with clay dikes to promote
infiltration. The depth of the trench may be increased with the approval of the Township Engineer. Pipe
can be utilized within the trench to increase the available storage volume. When the trench is installed
along a paved area that will need to be compacted during construction, extra attention needs to be paid to
avoid compaction in the area of the trench and to loosen the material under the trench prior to installation.
Determination of Water Quality Volume provided:
1 Area = L (length) x W (width) sq. ft.
2 Depth of Trench = D ft.
3 Volume = Area x D (Line 1 x Line 2) (stone not considered) cu. ft.
4
factor to determine void volume due to stone = 0.4 x Line 3 =
TOTAL VOLUME PROVIDED
(Use this number in Step Three)
cu. ft.
If perforated pipe is used in the bed, volume may be adjusted accordingly.
A-10
BMP #4 –RAIN GARDEN
Rain gardens are similar to the infiltration basin, but provide less storage volume and rely more on the
plantings to provide water quality and to remove the water through evapo-transpiration. Plant material
utilized in the rain garden should be selected by a landscaping professional and be suitable for the
proposed conditions. The bottom of the garden is a modified soil intended to hold water and allow it to
infiltrate. An overflow pipe is provided to take larger stormwater runoff away. The planted bed needs
regular maintenance and should be mulched on an annual basis. The entire bed should be dug up and
rejuvenated every three years or as necessary to maintain function. The owner of the facility should be
aware of the long term maintenance needs of the plant materials utilized.
Determination of Water Quality Volume provided:
1
Area – L (length) x W (width) for rectangular areas
estimate for irregular shapes
sq. ft.
2 Depth of Water on Surface = 6” = 0.5’ 0.5 ft.

TOTAL VOLUME PROVIDED (Line 3 + Line 5)
(Use this number in Step Three)
cu. ft.
A-11
BMP #5 –VEGETATED SWALE WITH CHECK DAM
A vegetated swale with a check dam provides both a way to convey water around the site and provide an
infiltration component. Swales should be installed with longitudinal slopes of 1-6%. Check dams are
provided for swales over 3% in slope. The swales should be planted with grasses that are sod forming and
can withstand frequent inundation or may be planted with other dense vegetation. For maximum benefit
the grasses in the swale should be mowed infrequently. The swale and check dams should be inspected
after every storm event to repair any erosion areas that may form. The dimensions shown for the channel
and check dam will satisfy most applications. Larger swales may be required depending on actual site
conditions.
Note: R-3 is approximately 3 inch stone & AASHTO No. 57 is approximately ½ inch stone
Determination of Water Quality Volume provided:
1 Check Dam Height ft.
2 Channel Slope = Vertical Rise / 100 ft length x 100% %
3 Impoundment Length = (Line 1 / Line 2) x 100 ft.
4 Side Slope (Horizontal Length in Ft./ 1 ft Vertical Rise)
5 Bottom Width of Channel ft.

0.5 x Line 3 x Line 1 x (Line 5 + Line 6) / 2
(Use this number in Step Three)
cu. ft.
A-12
SWM BMP #6 –CISTERN/RAIN BARREL
A cistern provides an artificial reservoir, such as a tank, for storing water. Cisterns date back to early
civilizations as a way to collect and manage stormwater. Historically the water was collected to serve as a
source of drinking water, but for these purposes, that is, as a SWM BMP, the cistern is not intended as a
source of drinking water but for utilization for watering plants/irrigation systems. The sizing of the
facility is primarily based on the intended use of the water. In order for the facility to be effective during
storm events it must be emptied on a regular basis between storms. No details are provided here since
each use would be unique. The following design criteria should be considered:
A. Determine the amount needed. Consider the area to be irrigated and the amount to be applied
and the frequency. This is the minimum volume to be stored. Consider a factor of safety to
allow for drought conditions.
B. Conversely, methods should be provided to draw down the cistern from time to time
especially during non-growing seasons to insure that there is adequate volume in the cistern
for storm events.
C. Stormwater from roofs is preferred due to their low amounts of pollutants and sediments.
D. Pumps and piping utilized in the system should be clearly labeled that this is not potable
water and cross-contamination of drinking water supplies must be avoided. All systems
should be watertight.
E. An overflow system should be provided.
F. Facilities need to be kept from freezing.
BMP #7 –PERVIOUS PAVER BLOCK
Pervious paver blocks consist of interlocking units (often concrete) that provide some portion of the
surface that may be filled with a pervious material such as gravel or topsoil. These are often used in patio
area or small parking areas. Pervious paver blocks can be utilized as part of site landscaping plan to
minimize the impervious coverage. Brand names of such products include, but are not limited to:
Turfstone, UNI Eco-stone, Checkerblock, EcoPaver, Turf Pavers, or Monoslab. If the products are
installed per manufacturer’s specification as part of a permeable paving system with minimal compaction,
the area can be considered as a non-impervious area in calculating the Water Quality Volume
requirements as part of Step One of the BMP Worksheets. The Township Engineer shall review all
materials proposed to determine if they are suitable for this application.

APPENDIX B
SITE DESIGN PROCESS
B -2
NATURAL HYDROLOGY SITE DESIGN PROCESS
INTRODUCTION
Section 304 identifies a natural hydrology site design process that strives to minimize
disturbances to land, site hydrology, and natural resources, and maintain the natural hydrologic
regime, drainage patterns and flow conditions of a site to the maximum extent practicable. This
appendix is intended to build on that process by providing additional information for achieving
site designs that best maintain pre-construction stormwater runoff conditions, protect site
amenities, and preserve natural resources. This appendix describes the following components of
the natural hydrology site design process:
• Design Principles and Techniques;
• Design Process;
• Design Practices; and
• References.
Some common drainage design approaches for land development radically alter natural
hydrologic conditions by constructing collection and conveyance systems that are designed to
remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin. This
approach has often led to the degradation of water quality, reduced groundwater recharge, and
increased volumes of runoff, as well as the expenditure of additional resources for detaining and
managing increased volumes of concentrated runoff at some downstream location.
The natural hydrology site design process encourages land development site designs that
minimize post-development runoff rates and volumes, and that minimize needs for artificial
conveyance and storage facilities. This process strives to incorporate the desired land
development into the natural hydrologic landscape in a manner that maintains and utilizes
existing site hydrology features and functions to minimize generation of new stormwater. This
avoids cumulative environmental impacts often associated with land development, and reducing
the need for and size of constructed stormwater facilities. This approach minimizes the
disturbance of land area, natural features and site hydrology; preserves significant concentrations
of open space, woodlands, and corridors of environmentally sensitive features; and incorporates
landscape-based BMPs and low impact development techniques to minimize the utilization of
more intrusive structural stormwater facilities.
With this design process, the primary goals of a land development project can be achieved while
minimizing the negative environmental impacts and avoiding management costs associated with
unnecessary stormwater runoff. The fundamental principle of this design process is that site
hydrology features are considered “up front” in the land development design process and are
prioritized as integral aspects to be maintained and utilized within the site design, rather than
being first sacrificed for space needed for traditional site layout or for construction of more
intrusive stormwater facilities.
B -3
Natural hydrology site design is not a new approach but rather a holistic process that combines
certain principles of Low Impact Development, Conservation Design, and Sustainable Design,
and focuses on reducing unnecessary alterations to the natural patterns and functions of existing
on-site hydrologic features. These natural hydrologic features tend to perform their “hydrologic
function” (i.e., infiltration, evapotranspiration, flow attenuation, pollutant removal, etc.) very
efficiently and sometimes have the hydrologic capacity to perform that function on increased
runoff loadings from the built environment. However, care must be taken to adequately
characterize the capacity of their hydrologic function and avoid overwhelming the feature with
excessive runoff loadings, thus causing unintended impairments that are completely counterproductive
to the purpose of natural hydrology site design.
Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful site design considerations. Natural
hydrology site design should serve as the foundation of the overall site design approach, and
when applied in conjunction with the design professional’s overall land development goals and
desired outcomes, can help shape the overall vision and conceptual layout of the land
development project.
Site design practices include preserving natural drainage features, minimizing impervious
surface area, reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces, and protecting natural
depression storage. Applying this site design process helps maintain site hydrology and manage
stormwater by: minimizing the generation of stormwater runoff (achieved by designing to the
land, considering site drainage patterns and infiltration characteristics, reducing grading and
compaction, and considering scale and placement of buildings); managing stormwater as close to
the point of generation as possible (by disconnecting impervious surfaces and distributing storm
flows to landscaped-based BMPs); providing open and vegetated channel conveyance (as needed
to treat water quality, reduce velocity and infiltrate); and managing remaining conveyed
stormwater in common open space (as needed to disperse low velocity storm flows, treat water
quality, infiltrate, and release). A well-designed site will contain a mix of all those features.
DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES
Natural hydrology site design involves identifying and prioritizing natural resources and natural
and man-made hydrologic features, and incorporating such features into the overall site design to
take advantage of their efficiencies of hydrologic performance, their cost efficiencies of reducing
the need for or size of constructed stormwater facilities, and their aesthetic amenities. The five
Design Principles to be achieved by this approach are as follows:
• Minimize land disturbance – both surface and subsurface.
• Minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious and compacted surfaces.
• Designing to the land, so that the layout of constructed and landscape features utilizes the
natural topography and minimizes grading.
• Design the constructed stormwater management system to take advantage of the natural
hydrologic landscape to achieve the required stormwater runoff control standards.
B -4
• Refine the site design and layout to optimize the cumulative benefits of the natural
hydrologic features, the constructed stormwater management system, and the land
development components to achieve the minimum post-construction runoff volume, peak
discharge rates and pollutant loads from the proposed land development site.
Techniques to be applied to achieve the design principles are presented in Table B.1.
DESIGN PROCESS
The first step in applying natural hydrology site design is to identify, delineate and assess the
functions of all existing natural resources and natural and man-made hydrologic features that: are
located within the project site; will receive discharge from the project site; or, may be impacted
by runoff or disturbance from the proposed land development project. This includes:
• Streams, waterways, springs, wetlands, vernal pools, and water bodies;
• Drainage patterns, conveyances and discharge points;
• Natural infiltration areas and patterns;
• Areas of natural vegetation that provide significant evapotranspiration, pollutant removal,
bank stabilization, flow attenuation, or riparian buffer functions;
• Floodplains; and
• Other features that contribute to the overall hydrologic function and value of the site and
its receiving streams.
Once this inventory and assessment are completed, these identified resources and features are
then prioritized for their ability to provide hydrologic function and performance for managing
runoff from the proposed site improvements. Specifically, they should be prioritized as follows:
• Those to be incorporated into the site design in a manner that provides for their protection
from any disturbance or impact from the proposed land development;
• Those to be protected from further disturbance or impact and for which the proposed land
development will provide improvement to existing conditions;
• Those that can be incorporated into and utilized as components of the overall site design
in a manner that protects or improves their existing conditions while utilizing their
hydrologic function (e.g., for infiltration, evapotranspiration, or reducing pollutant loads,
runoff volume or peak discharge rates, etc.) to reduce the need for or size of constructed
BMPs; and
• Those that may be considered for alteration, disturbance or removal.
These prioritizations are then applied as the basis on which to begin the site design lay-out,
grading, construction, and permanent ground cover designs to achieve the five (5) Design
Principles outlined above. The following section describes just a few of the many design
practices, methods and techniques that are available to achieve the landowner’s desired land
development goals and the desired environmental efficiencies intended by natural hydrology site
design.

Table B.1 – Site Design Process Principles and Techniques
Design Principles
Design Techniques
Minimize land disturbance – both
surface and subsurface.
• Maintain the natural soil structure and vegetative cover that are often
critical components of maintaining the hydrologic functions of natural
infiltration, bioretention, flow attenuation, evapotranspiration, and
pollutant removal.
• Protect, or improve, natural resources to reduce the needs for
environmental mitigation, future environmental restoration, and
cumulative flow and water quality impacts of unnecessary disturbances
within the watershed system.
• Minimize the disturbance of natural surface and groundwater drainage
features and patterns, discharge points and flow characteristics, natural
infiltration and evapotranspiration patterns and characteristics, natural
stream channel stability, and floodplain conveyance, etc.
Minimize the cumulative area to
be covered by impervious and
compacted surfaces.
• Minimize the size of individual impervious surfaces.
• Separate large impervious surfaces into smaller components.
• Disconnect runoff from one impervious surface to another.
• Avoid unnecessary impervious surfaces.
• Utilize porous materials where suited in lieu of impervious materials.
Designing to the land, so that the
layout of constructed and
landscape features utilizes the
natural topography and
minimizes grading.
• Prioritize on-site hydrologic features (i.e., for protection, improvement,
utilization, or alteration) and natural site drainage patterns and
infiltration characteristics and consider them for the cornerstones of the
conceptual site design.
• Reduce grading and compaction by applying selective grading design
methods to provide final grading patterns tthat preserve existing
topography where it most benefits natural hydrologic functions and
where needed; this results in graded areas that evenly distribute runoff
and minimize concentrated runoff flows.
• Consider the scale and placement of buildings and other infrastructure to
minimize impact to natural hydrologic features.
• Incorporate unique natural, scenic, and historic site features into the
configuration of the development, and ensure flexibility in development
design to meet community needs for complimentary and aesthetically
pleasing development, such as can be achieved through Conservation
Design and Sustainable Design approaches.
B -6
Design the constructed
stormwater management system
to take advantage of the natural
hydrologic landscape to achieve
the required stormwater runoff
control standards.
• Incorporate natural hydrologic features that have been selected for their
available capacity and function into the overall system of site runoff
controls.
• Incorporate Low Impact Development (or similar) BMPs and distribute
storm flows to:
o Reduce runoff;
o Manage stormwater at or as close to the point of generation as
possible;
o Disconnect discharges from streets and municipal storm sewer
systems; and
o Select and design BMPs to give first priority to nonstructural
and vegetation (landscape-based) BMPs, second priority to
surface structural BMPs, third priority to subsurface structural
BMPs, and design subsurface BMPs as shallow as possible.
• Provide open channel conveyance, as needed, to:
o Treat water quality;
o Reduce runoff velocity; and
o Promote infiltratation and evapotranspiration of runoff.
• Manage remaining conveyed stormwater from small storms in common
open space areas to achieve multiple objectives:
o Disperse storm flows and reduce velocity;
o Treat water quality; and
o Promote infiltrate and evapotranspiration of runoff.
• Provide for appropriate conveyance to retention or detention storage
facilities as needed for flows from large storm events.
• Maintain open space functions consistent with common area uses
(passive recreation, on-site sewage management, scenic vistas, etc).
Refine the site design and layout
to optimize the cumulative
benefits of the natural hydrologic
features, the constructed
stormwater management system,
and the land development
components to achieve the
minimum post-construction
runoff volume, peak discharge
rates and pollutant loads from the
proposed land development site.
Apply site design techniques and practices as appropriate based on:
• Conservation Design principles and practices.
• Sustainable Design principles and practices.
• Low Impact Development Design principles and practices.
DESIGN PRACTICES
Numerous practices and strategies can be considered where their aim is to sustain and utilize the
benefits of existing site hydrology and minimize the generation of new stormwater runoff.
Following are brief descriptions of various practices that can be used to achieve the principles of
the natural hydrology site design process.
B -7
Site Layout Practices
The following site layout practices are but a few of the methods by which the natural hydrology
site design process described above can be implemented. Such practices are less functions of
regimented codes and procedures than about understanding and recognizing the benefits and
values that existing resources can contribute to the desired outcomes of the land development
project. In some circumstances, communication among design engineers, land planning and
environmental professionals, knowledgeable developers, community representatives, and
regulatory authorities is also beneficial to combine their collective understanding and
perspectives to create effective planning efforts.
Preserving Natural Drainage Features. Protecting natural drainage features, particularly
vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and
attenuate flows and to filter pollutants. Unfortunately, some common land development practices
encourage just the opposite pattern -- streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in
the natural headwater valleys and swales, thereby replacing natural drainage functions with an
impervious system. As a result, runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow
directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation, infiltration, or filtration.
Designing developments to fit site topography retains much of the natural drainage function. In
addition, designing with the land minimizes the amount of site grading, reduces the amount of
compaction that can alter site infiltration characteristics, and can result in cost savings to the
developer.
Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depressional storage areas have no surface
outlet, or drain very slowly following a storm event. They can be commonly seen as ponded
areas in fields during the wet season or after large runoff events. Some development practices
eliminate these depressions by filling or draining, thereby eliminating their ability to reduce
surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and release-rate characteristics of
depressions should be protected in the design of the development site to assist in reducing runoff
volumes and reducing runoff rates. Designing around the depression, or incorporating its storage
as additional capacity in required detention facilities, treats this area as a site amenity rather than
a detriment.
Avoiding Introduction of Impervious Areas. Careful site planning should consider reducing
impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible. Building footprints, sidewalks, driveways,
and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on
runoff. In many instances, municipalities have the ability to reduce impervious cover by
providing incentives or opportunities in their zoning and subdivision/ land development
ordinances to reduce road width, reduce or modify cul-de-sac dimensions, reduce or modify
curbing requirements, and reduce or modify sidewalk requirements.
Disconnecting Impervious Surfaces. Impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if
they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system (such as storm sewer). Two
basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing roof runoff over lawns and reducing the
use of storm sewers. Site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff
from these sources, and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point within the
project site.
B -8
Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns. Roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site
designs. The practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to “driveway-to-street-tostorm
sewers” or parking lots. The practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots
to the street. Crowning the driveway, to run off to the lawn, uses the lawn as a filter strip.
Reducing Street Widths. Street widths can be reduced by either eliminating on-street parking
and/or by reducing roadway widths. Designers should select the narrowest practical street width
for the design conditions (speed, curvature, etc.). Narrower neighborhood streets should be
considered and encouraged under select conditions. Reduced street widths also can lower
maintenance needs and costs.
Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in
low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicycle/recreational trails
that follow back-of-lot lines as an alternative to reduced sidewalks, where appropriate.
Reducing Building Setbacks. Reducing building setbacks (from streets) reduces the size of
impervious areas of driveways and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic
streets where traffic noise is not a problem.
Constructing Compact Developments or Conservation Design: Low impact cluster or compact
development can reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots. Savings
result from reduced street length, which also contributes to a reduction in development and longterm
maintenance costs. Reduced site disturbance and preservation of open space help buffer
sensitive natural areas and retain more of a site’s natural hydrology. Development can be
designed so that areas of high infiltration soils are reserved as stormwater infiltration areas.
Construction activity can be focused onto les -sensitive areas without affecting the gross density
of development.
Stormwater Best Management Practices
Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) are intended to supplement natural hydrology
site design techniques where needed. Structural in nature, such practices include bioretention
facilities, rain gardens, swales and other engineered stormwater BMPs. Listed here are
techniques intended to help manage stormwater predominantly at or near the source, rather than
traditional techniques that largely release runoff over an extended period of time to adjacent
properties and streams. This list, in no way exhaustive, gives examples of a few of the most
common practices.
Bioretention. This type of BMP combines open space with stormwater treatment. Soil and
plants, rather than sand filters, treat and store runoff. Infiltration and evapotranspiration are
achieved, often coupled with an underdrain to collect water not infiltrated or used in the root
zone.
Rain Gardens. Typically rain gardens are shallow depression areas containing a mix of water
tolerant native plant species. The intent is to capture runoff for storage and use in the root zone
of plants. Intended largely as a way of managing stormwater through evapotranspiration (ET),
rain gardens often function as infiltration facilities as well.
B -9
Reducing the Need for Storm Sewers. Increasing the use of natural or vegetated drainage swales
can reduce the need for extending storm sewers for draining streets, parking lots, and back yards,
the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced. The practice
requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites, especially if
there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a “reasonable” time. The practice requires
educating local citizens, who may expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event.
Using Permeable Paving Materials. These materials include permeable interlocking concrete
paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete, among others. Such materials should be
considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces, especially for low use surfaces
such as driveways, overflow parking lots, and emergency access roads. Surfaces for which seal
coats may be applied should refrain from using permeable paving materials.

Other sources that include pictures of selected streams as a guide to n
value determination are available (Fasken, 1963; Barnes, 1967; and
Hicks and Mason, 1991). In general, these references provide color
photos with tables of calibrated n values for a range of flows.
Although there are many factors that affect the selection of the n value
for the channel, some of the most important factors are the type and
size of materials that compose the bed and banks of a channel, and
the shape of the channel. Cowan (1956) developed a procedure for
estimating the effects of these factors to determine the value of
Manning's n of a channel. In Cowan's procedure, the value of n is
computed by the following equation:

WEST NILE VIRUS GUIDANCE
Monroe County Conservation District Guidance:
Stormwater Management and West Nile Virus
Source: Brodhead McMichaels Creeks Watershed Act 167 Stormwater Management
Ordinance Final Draft 2/23/04
(This source is from the Monroe County, PA Conservation District that researched the potential of West Nile Virus
problems from BMPs due to a number of calls they were receiving)
The Monroe County Conservation District recognizes the need to address the problem of nonpoint source
pollution impacts caused by runoff from impervious surfaces. The new stormwater policy being
integrated into Act 167 stormwater management regulations by the PA Department of Environmental
Protection (PADEP) will make nonpoint pollution controls an important component of all future plans
and updates to existing plans. In addition, to meet post-construction anti-degradation standards under the
state National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program, applicants will be
required to employ Best Management Practices (BMPs) to address nonpoint pollution concerns.
Studies conducted throughout the United States have shown that wet basins and in particular constructed
wetlands are effective in traditional stormwater management areas such as channel stability and flood
control and are one of the most effective ways to remove stormwater pollutants (United States
Environmental Protection Agency 1991, Center for Watershed Protection 2000). From Maryland to
Oregon, studies have shown that as urbanization and impervious surfaces increase in a watershed, the
streams in those watersheds become degraded (CWP 2000). Although there is debate over the threshold
of impervious cover when degradation becomes apparent (some studies show as little as 6% while others
show closer to 20%), there is agreement that impervious surfaces cause nonpoint pollution in urban and
urbanizing watersheds and that degradation is ensured if stormwater BMPs are not implemented.
Although constructed wetlands and ponds are desirable from a water quality perspective, there may be
concerns about the possibility of these stormwater management structures becoming breeding grounds for
mosquitoes. The Conservation District feels that although it may be a valid concern, municipalities
should not adopt ordinance provisions prohibiting wet basins for stormwater management.
Mosquitoes
The questions surrounding mosquito production in wetlands and ponds have intensified in recent years by
the outbreak of the mosquito-borne West Nile Virus. As is the case with all vector-borne maladies, the
life cycle of West Nile Virus is complicated, traveling from mosquito to bird, back to mosquito, and then
to other animals including humans. Culex pipiens was identified as the vector species in the first
documented cases from New York in 1999. This species is still considered the primary transmitter of the
disease across its range. Today there are some 60 species of mosquitoes that inhabit Pennsylvania. Along
with C. pipiens, three other species have been identified as vectors of West Nile Virus while four more
have been identified as potential vectors.
The four known vectors in NE Pennsylvania are Culex pipiens, C. restuans, C. salinarius, and
Ochlerotatus japonicus. All four of these species prefer, and almost exclusively use, artificial containers
(old tires, rain gutters, birdbaths, etc.) as larval habitats. In the case of C. pipiens, the most notorious of
the vector mosquitoes, the dirtier the water, the better they like it. The important factor is that these
species do not thrive in functioning wetlands where competition for resources and predation by larger
aquatic and terrestrial organisms is high.
D-3
The remaining four species, Aedes vexans, Ochlerotatus Canadensis, O. triseriatus, and O. trivittatus, are
currently considered potential vectors due to laboratory tests (except the O. trivittatus, which did have one
confirmed vector pool for West Nile Virus in PA during 2002). All four of these species prefer vernal
habitats and ponded woodland areas following heavy summer rains. These species may be the greatest
threat of disease transmission around stormwater basins that pond water for more than four days. This can
be mitigated, however, by establishing ecologically functioning wetlands.
Stormwater Facilities
If a stormwater wetland or pond is constructed properly and a diverse ecological community develops,
mosquitoes should not become a problem. Wet basins and wetlands constructed as stormwater
management facilities should be designed to attract a diverse wildlife community. If a wetland is planned,
proper hydrologic soil conditions and the establishment of hydrophytic vegetation will promote the
population of the wetland by amphibians and other mosquito predators. In natural wetlands, predatory
insects and amphibians are effective at keeping mosquito populations in check during the larval stage of
development while birds and bats prey on adult mosquitoes.
The design of a stormwater wetland must include the selection of hydrophytic plant species for their
pollutant uptake capabilities and for not contributing to the potential for vector mosquito breeding. In
particular, species of emergent vegetation with little submerged growth are preferable. By limiting the
vegetation growing below the water surface, larvae lose protective cover, and there is less chance of
anaerobic conditions occurring in the water.
Stormwater ponds can be designed for multiple purposes. When incorporated into an open space design, a
pond can serve as a stormwater management facility and a community amenity. Aeration fountains and
stocked fish should be added to keep larval mosquito populations in check.
Publications from the PA Department of Health and the Penn State Cooperative Extension concerning
West Nile Virus identify aggressive public education about the risks posed by standing water in artificial
containers (tires, trash cans, rain gutters, bird baths) as the most effective method to control vector
mosquitoes.
Conclusion
The Conservation District understands the pressure faced by municipalities when dealing with
multifaceted issues such as stormwater management and encourages the incorporation of water quality
management techniques into stormwater designs. As Monroe County continues to grow, conservation
design, infiltration, and constructed wetlands and ponds should be among the preferred design options to
reduce the impacts of increases in impervious surfaces. When designed and constructed appropriately, the
runoff mitigation benefits to the community from these design options will far outweigh their potential to
become breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

a community sewage system which contains a septic tank shall have the system’s septic
tank pumped by a Chester County Health Department Licensed Liquid Waste Hauler at
least once every three years or whenever an inspection reveals that the septic tank is
filled with solids or scum in excess of 1/3 of the liquid depth of the tank. Any person or
person owning a community sewage system or property owner served by a community
sewage system shall execute a sewage management agreement approved by the
Township and requiring all such property owners serviced by such system to maintain,
operate and inspect the system in conformance to all rules and regulations of the DEP,
Health Department and Township.
D. The required pumping frequency may be increased at the discretion of an Authorized
Agent if the septic tank is undersized compared to the current standard, if solids build-up
in the tank is above average, if the hydraulic load on the system increases significantly
above design capacity, if the system malfunctions or for other good cause shown.
E. All septic tanks shall be pumped through the manhole access of each tank or tank
chamber.
F. Upon completion of the pumping of any septic tank, the interior of the tank, if accessible,
shall be inspected by the pumper/hauler or other qualified individual acceptable to the

first contact the Sewage Enforcement Officer for approval of the necessary repair.
G. Any person owning a building served by an individual or community on-lot sewage
disposal system, which contains an aerobic treatment tank shall follow the operation and
maintenance recommendations of the equipment manufacturer. A copy of the

submitted to the Township within six months of the effective date of this ordinance.
Thereafter, service receipts shall be submitted to the Chester County Septage
Management Database, if applicable, at the intervals specified by the manufacturer’s
recommendations. In no case may the service or pumping intervals for aerobic treatment
tanks exceed those required for septic tanks.
H. Any person owning a building served by a cesspool or dry well in an area of numerous
malfunctions or in an area where a repair is not technically feasible, shall have that
system pumped according to the schedule prescribed for septic tanks to mitigate
potential pollution. As an alternative to this scheduled pumping of the cesspool or dry
well, and pending any scheduled replacement of the substandard system as identified in
the Act 537 Plan, the owner may apply for a sewage permit from the Sewage
Enforcement Officer for a septic tank to be installed preceding the cesspool or dry well.
For this interim repair system consisting of a cesspool or dry well preceded by an
approved septic tank, only the septic tank must be pumped at the prescribed interval.

limited to, cleaning and unclogging of piping, servicing and the repair of mechanical
equipment leveling of distribution boxes, tanks and lines, removal of obstructing roots or
trees, the diversion of surface water away from the disposal area, etc.
J. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of a lot, which utilizes an individual or
community on-lot sewage disposal system, to maintain surface contouring and other
measures consistent with the provisions found in 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 73 (relating to
standards for on lot sewage treatment facilities) to divert stormwater away from treatment
facilities and absorption areas and to protect the absorption areas from physical damage.
K. Small flow treatment facilities shall be operated and maintained through a maintenance
agreement between the person owning such a facility or property owner served by such a
facility and an individual firm or corporation experienced in the operation and
maintenance of sewage treatment facilities. Any such firm or corporation shall be
approved by the Department, Health Department and/or Township.
Section VIII. System Rehabilitation.
A. No person shall operate or maintain an individual or community on-lot sewage
disposal system in such a manner that it malfunctions. All sewage wastes shall be
discharged to a treatment tank. No sewage systems shall discharge untreated or
partially treated sewage to the surface of the ground or into the waters of the
Commonwealth unless a permit for such discharge has been obtained from the
Department. Discharges into the surface waters of the Commonwealth will not be
permitted except for replacement of malfunctioning systems and only then if all other
alternative disposal systems are found to be infeasible.
B. A written notice of violation shall be issued to any person who is the owner of any
property that is found to be served by a malfunctioning individual or community on-lot
sewage disposal system or that is discharging sewage without a permit. The
Sewage Enforcement Officer shall be notified of all violations.
C. Within thirty (30) days of notification by the Township or Health Department that a
malfunction has been identified, the property owner shall make application to the
Sewage Enforcement Officer for a permit to repair or replace the malfunctioning
system. Within ninety (90) days of initial notification by the Township, construction of
the permitted repair or replacement shall commence, weather permitting. Within one
(1) year of the original notification by the Township, the construction shall be
completed unless seasonal or unique conditions mandate a longer period, in which
case the Township, in cooperation with the Sewage Enforcement Officer, shall set an
extended completion date.
D. The Sewage Enforcement Officer shall have the authority to require the repair of any
malfunction by the following methods: cleaning, repair or replacement of components
of the existing system, adding capacity or otherwise altering or replacing the system’s
treatment tank, replacing the existing disposal area, replacing a gravity distribution
system with a pressurized system, replacing the system with a holding tank, or any
10
other alternative approved by the Sewage Enforcement Officer or the Department
appropriate for the specific site.
E. In lieu of, or in combination with, the remedies described in Subsection D above, the
Authorized Agent may require the installation of water conservation equipment and
the institution of water conservation practices in structures served. Water using
devices and appliances in the structure may be required to be retrofitted with water
saving appurtenances or they may be required to be replaced by water conserving
devices.
F. In the event that the rehabilitation measures in Subsections A through E are not
feasible or effective as determined by the Sewage Enforcement Officer or the
Department, the owner may be required to apply to the Department for a permit to
install a single residence treatment and discharge system. Upon receipt of said
permit the owner shall complete construction of the system within six (6) months,
weather permitting.
G. Should none of the remedies in this section be totally effective in eliminating the
malfunction of an existing individual or community on-lot sewage disposal system the
property owner is not absolved of responsibility for that malfunction. The Township
may require whatever action is necessary to lessen or mitigate the malfunction to the
extent possible.
