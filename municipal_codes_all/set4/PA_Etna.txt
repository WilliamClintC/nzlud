payable to such participant under § 85-10B, effective as of each
anniversary date of the original commencement of the participant's
retirement benefit payments hereunder. Such cost-of-living adjustment

special ad hoc post-retirement adjustment, effective July 1, 2002, equal
to the following formula:
($0.15 x years of service x years retired) multiplied by
[(2.5% x years retired up to 25) + (7.5% x years retired over 25)]

reduced annually by 65% of the total amount of any post-retirement
adjustments provided to the retiree after December 31, 1988, and
before December 31, 2001, and paid in the immediately preceding
year.

attainment of age 62 by the participant, the limitation herein
shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis in

however, in the case of a qualified participant (a participant
with respect to whom a period of at least 15 years of service as

age 65 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be
adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with
applicable regulations to the amount determined herein
commencing at age 65;
(d) Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000
from all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer
expressed as an annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed
the limitation of this section, provided that the employer has
not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which
the participant has participated; however, in the case of a
participant who is not receiving a disability retirement benefit
or a survivor benefit hereunder (if applicable), with fewer than
10 years of participation, the limitation expressed in this
Subsection H(1)(d) shall be reduced by 1/10 for each year of

1:31
participation less than 10, but in no event shall this limitation
be less than $1,000;
(e) The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan
years for calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined
benefit plans maintained by the employer as one defined
benefit plan and to all defined contribution plans maintained by
the employer as one defined contribution plan, and shall be
applied and interpreted consistent with Code Section 415 and
regulations thereunder as applicable to government plans in
general and this plan in particular;
(f) In the case of a survivor benefit under § 85-12B or a disability
retirement benefit under § 85-11B hereunder (if applicable),
the adjustment under Subsection H(1)(b) and (e) hereof shall
not apply, and the applicable limitation shall be the limitation
contained herein without regard to the age or years of service
or participation of the benefit recipient;
(g) Effective for distributions with annuity starting dates
beginning on or after December 31, 2008, notwithstanding any
other plan provisions to the contrary, the applicable mortality
table used solely for purposes of adjusting any benefit or
limitation under Section 415(b)(2)(B), (C) or (D) of the Internal
Revenue Code, as set forth in the applicable maximum benefit
limitations section of the plan is the applicable mortality table
under Code Section 417(e)(3)(B); and
(h) Effective as of January 1, 2008, for the purpose of Code Section
415(b)(1)(A), the "applicable mortality table" and "applicable
interest rate" are found in Rev. Rul. 2007-67.

anything contained in this section to the contrary, the limitations,
adjustments, and other requirements prescribed in this section

date and extending over the life of such participant or over the
§ 85-10 ETNA CODE § 85-10
1:32
lives of such participant and a designated beneficiary (or over
a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
participant, or the joint life expectancies of such participant
and a designated beneficiary).
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
prior to the date when his entire interest has been distributed
to him after distribution of his benefits has begun in
accordance with Subsection I(1)(b) above, the remaining
portion of such benefit shall be distributed at least as rapidly
as under the method of distribution being used under
Subsection I(1)(b) as of the date of his death.
(2) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
before distribution of his benefit has begun, the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of
such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any
portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) a designated beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over
the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such
distributions begin not later than one year after the date of the
employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury; then for purposes of the
five-year rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit
payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the
date on which such distributions begin. Provided, however, that
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date
on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier
than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2; and further provided, if the surviving spouse dies before the
distributions to such spouse begin, this subparagraph shall be
applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
(3) For purposes of this section, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
(a) "Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the
employee attains age 70 1/2, or the calendar year in which the
employee retires.
(b) The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its
rules.
(c) Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become
payable to the surviving spouse upon such child's reaching
§ 85-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-10
1:33
majority (or other designated event permitted under
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
(d) For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee
and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case of a life
annuity) may be redetermined but not more frequently than
annually.
(4) General rules. The requirements of this section will take
precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. All
distributions required under this section will be determined and
made in accordance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue
Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder, and the employer's
good faith interpretation of such Code and regulations.
J. Assignment. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein shall not
be subject to attachment, execution, levy, garnishment or other legal
process and subject of a domestic relations order, mandated by a court
of competent jurisdiction, that clearly provides for proper distribution
of a portion of the pension benefit payments to an alternate payee
(former spouse of the participant) and does not require any benefit to
be paid in excess of the available earned and accrued under the plan.
K. Retired participants. Any participant who shall have retired prior to the
restatement date shall not have the benefit altered in any way by the
provisions of this amended and restated plan, except where otherwise
expressly provided herein. Such retired participants shall continue to
have their benefits governed by the terms of the plan in effect on the
day preceding the restatement date.
L. Limitation of liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the
employer, the plan administrator, any fiduciary or any agent or
representative of any of the foregoing to provide any retirement or
other benefit to any participant or beneficiary which cannot be provided
from the assets available in the pension fund, whether such benefits are
in pay status or otherwise payable under the terms of the plan. The
Council retains the right to amend or terminate this plan consistent
with applicable law at any time, with or without cause and whether or
not such action directly or indirectly results in the suspension,
reduction or termination of any benefit payable under the plan or in pay
status, and without liability to any person for any such action.
M. Personal right of participant. The right to receive any benefits under
this plan is a personal right of the participant and shall expire upon the
death of the participant. No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee
or other person claiming by or through a participant shall have any
interest in any benefits hereunder unless clearly and expressly so
provided by the terms of this plan or the provisions of applicable law. A
participant's election, failure to make an election or revocation of an
election hereunder shall be final and binding on all persons.
§ 85-10 ETNA CODE § 85-10
1:34
N. Nonduplication of benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a
participant who is receiving a retirement benefit under the plan and
who shall resume employment shall have benefit payments suspended
until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
date such employment shall cease. Upon resumption of benefit
payments, such participant shall receive the greater of the amount of
the suspended benefit or the amount of benefit based upon final
monthly average salary and aggregate service as of the date that such
period of resumed employment shall cease.
O. Direct rollovers.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that
would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by
the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2) This Subsection O(2)(b) shall apply to distributions made on or
after January 1, 2006. Notwithstanding any provisions of the plan
to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election
under this section, if a distribution in excess of $1,000 is made and
the distributee does not make an election under Subsection O(2)(a)
and does not elect to receive the distribution directly, the plan
administrator shall make such transfer to an individual retirement
plan of a designated trustee or issuer pursuant to authority and
duties of the plan administrator section of the plan. The plan
administrator shall notify the distributee in writing, within a
reasonable period of time and as otherwise prescribed by law, that
the distribution may be transferred to another individual
retirement plan.
(3) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

addition, the participant's or former participant's surviving spouse
and the participant's or former participant's spouse or former
spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic
A payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified
by the distributee or the plan administrator, if the distributee
does not make an election.
(a)
Effective January 1, 2008, direct rollovers may be made to a

Code to the extent that the applicable requirements of Code
Section 408A are satisfied with respect to any direct rollover
to such Roth IRA.

with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN  A qualified trust described in
Code Section 401(a), an individual retirement account described
in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described
in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code Section
403(a), an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), an
eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained
by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into
such plan from this plan.
ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION 
Any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover
distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of
a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy)
of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies)
of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution
to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section
401(a)(9); and the portion of any distribution that is not
includible in gross income (determined without regard to the
exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to
employer securities).
(a)
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section
of the plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be
an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not
includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid
only to an individual retirement account or annuity described
in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the
Code (effective for distributions on or after January 1, 2007,

to separately account for amounts so transferred, including
separately accounting for the portion of such distribution
which is includible in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includible.
(b)
(4) This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1,
2010. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary
that would otherwise limit a nonspouse beneficiary's election under
this section, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have any portion
of a plan distribution (that is payable to such nonspouse beneficiary
due to a participant's death) paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee

transfer to an individual retirement account described in Code
Section 408(a) or to an individual retirement annuity described in
Section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract) that has been
established for the purposes of receiving the distribution on behalf
of such nonspouse beneficiary. For these purposes, a "nonspouse
beneficiary" is an individual who is a designated beneficiary (as
defined by Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code) of a
participant and who is not the surviving spouse of such participant.
A. Disability retirement. A participant who shall incur a total and
permanent disability shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit
as of the disability date.
B. Disability retirement benefits. A participant who retires due to a total
and permanent disability, pursuant to § 85-11A shall be eligible for a
disability retirement benefit equal to 50% of the member's salary at the
time the disability was incurred, provided that any member who
receives benefits for the same injuries under social security disability
shall have the participant's disability benefits offset or reduced by the
amount of such benefits. The amount of the monthly disability benefit
(before social security offset) shall be no less than 50% of the
participant's salary at the time the disability occurs.
C. Payment of disability benefits.
(1) Disability payments shall be made monthly as of the first day of
each month, commencing as of the first day of the month coincident
with or immediately following the participant's disability date and
continuing until the earliest of the death of the participant,
cessation of total and permanent disability, or attainment of normal
retirement age (such a participant upon attainment of normal
retirement age shall thereafter receive a normal retirement benefit
under the terms of the plan).
(2) A participant who shall fail to return within three months to
employment as an employee of the employer upon cessation of total
and permanent disability prior to attainment of normal retirement
age shall be deemed to have terminated employment as of the
disability date, and shall not be entitled to any distribution of
accumulated contributions pursuant to § 85-13B to the extent that
the total amount of disability payments exceeds the value of the
participant's accumulated contributions as of the disability date.
D. Verification of disability. The plan administrator shall in its sole
discretion determine whether a participant shall have incurred a total
and permanent disability. The plan administrator shall rely on the
report of a physician acceptable to the plan administrator. If the plan
administrator shall determine that a participant who is totally and
permanently disabled has recovered sufficiently to resume active

§ 85-12. Death benefits.
employment as a police officer or if a participant refuses to undergo
a medical examination as directed by the plan administrator (such a
medical examination may not be required more frequently than once
in any given twelve-month period), the payment of disability retirement
benefits shall cease.
E. Cessation of disability. A participant who is receiving payment of
disability retirement benefits under this plan must notify the plan
administrator of any change which may cause a cessation of entitlement
to receipt of such benefits hereunder. If a participant fails to provide
immediate notice to the plan administrator of any such change in status
and continues to receive payment of benefits hereunder to which the
participant is not entitled, then the plan may take whatever action is
necessary to recover any amount of improperly paid amounts, including
legal action or offsetting such amounts against any future payments of
retirement or other benefits under the plan, including the costs of such
actions.
A. Death of participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of a participant,
there shall be benefits payable in accordance with the following
sections of this § 85-12.
B. Survivor benefit. If a participant shall die after commencement of
benefit payments or after becoming eligible to receive benefit
payments, a survivor benefit shall be paid to the surviving spouse, if
any, of the participant in an amount equal to 50% of the benefit the
participant was receiving or was eligible to receive as of the date of
death. The survivor benefit shall be paid to the surviving spouse until
the date of death of the surviving spouse. Upon the death of the
surviving spouse, the survivor benefit shall be paid monthly in equal
shares to the surviving dependent children of the deceased participant
until attainment of age 18 or, if attending college, under or attaining the
age of 23.
C. Payment of survivor benefit. The survivor benefit commences as of the
first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the date
of death of the participant. The survivor benefit shall be paid monthly to
the surviving spouse of the participant, if any, until the date of death of
the surviving spouse. Upon the death of the surviving spouse or if there
is no surviving spouse, the survivor benefit shall be paid monthly in
equal shares to the surviving dependent children of the deceased
participant who have not attained 18 years of age, or if attending
college, under or attaining the age of 23. The shares payable to the
surviving dependent children shall be adjusted as each child ceases to
be eligible to receive a share of the benefit hereunder.
D. Death of participant prior to retirement. If a participant shall die before
payment of a benefit has commenced and without eligibility for
payment of a survivor benefit under § 85-12B, the beneficiary shall be

§ 85-14. Administration.
eligible to receive a distribution in an amount equal to the accumulated
contributions of the participant as of the date of death of the
participant.
E. Veterans' survivor benefits. Notwithstanding any other provision of the
plan to the contrary, in the case of the death of a participant who dies on
or after January 1, 2007, while performing qualified military service (as
defined in Code Section 414(u)), the survivors of the participant are
entitled to any additional benefits under the plan (if any) had the
participant resumed and then terminated employment on account of
death.
A. Rights of terminated employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided shall have all
interest and rights under this plan limited to those contained in the
following section of this article.
B. Distribution of accumulated contributions. A participant or beneficiary
of a participant, whose employment with the employer shall terminate
for any reason, including the death of the participant prior to
attainment of normal retirement age shall be entitled to receive a
distribution of accumulated contributions. Upon receipt of such
accumulated contributions, said participant and beneficiary shall not be
entitled to any further payments from the plan.
C. Deferred vested benefit. A participant who has completed at least 12
years of aggregate service and whose employment with the employer
shall terminate for any reason other than death or disability prior to
attainment of normal retirement age shall be entitled to elect to receive
a deferred vested benefit in lieu of a distribution of accumulated
contributions under § 85-13B. Such a deferred vested benefit shall be in
an amount equal to the participant's accrued benefit as of the date
employment terminates and shall commence after application pursuant
to § 85-10G as of the first day of the month coincident with or next
following the date on which the participant's normal retirement age
would be attained if the participant continued in employment until such
date. Any election made under this § 85-13C must be made in a writing
acceptable to the plan administrator within 90 days of the date which
was the last day of employment. If no election is made hereunder within
the applicable election period the participant shall be deemed to have
forever waived this election and shall receive a distribution of
accumulated contributions pursuant to § 85-13B hereof.
D. Forfeiture. To the extent permissible under the Code, rights under this
plan shall be subject to forfeiture pursuant to the act of July 8, 1978
(P.L. 752, No. 140), known as the "Public Employee Pension Forfeiture
Act," 43 P.S. § 1311 et seq.

appointed, the Council shall be the plan administrator.
B. Police Pension Committee. If the Council shall appoint a Police Pension
Committee to administer the affairs of the plan, the Council shall
delegate such authority as it shall deem appropriate to the Committee.
The Committee shall consist of not more than five members appointed

in good faith shall, upon the Council's review and approval thereof,

E. Plan administrator costs. The plan administrator shall serve without
compensation for services unless otherwise agreed by the Council in
writing. All reasonable expenses incident to the functioning of the plan
administrator, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants,
counsel, actuaries and other specialists and other costs of
administering the plan, may be paid from the pension fund upon
approval by the Council to the extent permitted under applicable law
and not otherwise paid by the employer.
F. Hold harmless. No member of the Council, the plan administrator, nor
any other person involved in the administration of the plan shall be
liable to any person on account of any act or failure to act which is
taken or omitted to be taken in good faith in performing their respective
duties under the terms of this plan. To the extent permitted by law, the
employer shall, and hereby does agree to, indemnify and hold harmless
the plan administrator and each successor and each of any such
individual's heirs, executors and administrators, and the delegates and
appointees (other than any person, bank, firm or corporation which is
independent of the employer and which renders services to the plan for
a fee) from any and all liability and expenses, including counsel fees,
reasonably incurred in any action, suit or proceeding to which he is or
may be made a party by reason of being or having been a member,
delegate or appointee of the plan administrator, except in matters
involving criminal liability, intentional or willful misconduct. If the
employer purchases insurance to cover claims of a nature described
above, then there shall be no right of indemnification except to the
extent of any deductible amount under the insurance coverage or to the
extent of the amount the claims exceed the insured amount.
G. Approval of benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within 30 days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under
the circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits
shall be in writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
H. Appeal procedure. Any person whose application for retirement
benefits is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who
believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so commence
or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant"), shall
first seek a resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set
forth.
(1) Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan
administrator which shall fully describe the nature of the claim.
The plan administrator shall review the claim and make an initial
determination approving or denying the claim.
(2) If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator
shall, within 90 days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail
notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may

1:42
§ 85-15. The pension fund.
be extended by the plan administrator if special circumstances so
require for up to 90 additional days by the plan administrator's
delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a
notice of denial, shall set forth (i) the specific plan provisions
on which the denial is based, (ii) an explanation of additional
material or information, if any necessary to perfect such claim and
a statement of why such material or information is necessary, and
(iii) an explanation of the review procedure.
(3) Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by the Council of the
initial determination. Such request for review must be made by
notice to the Council within 60 days of receipt of such notice of
denial. During such review, the claimant or a duly authorized
representative shall have the right to review any pertinent
documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The
Council shall, within 60 days after receipt of the notice requesting
such review, (or in special circumstances, such as where the
Council in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of
receipt of such notice), submit its decision in writing to the person
or persons whose claim has been denied. The decision shall be
final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall
contain specific references to the pertinent plan provisions on
which the decision is based.
(4) Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted unless the
plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
(5) A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time
limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
A. Operation of the pension fund.
(1) The Council is hereby authorized to hold and supervise the
investment of the assets of the pension fund, subject to the
provisions of the laws of the commonwealth and of this plan and
any amendment thereto.

expenses of administering the plan pursuant to authorization by the
employer.

(3) The employer intends the plan to be permanent and for the
exclusive benefit of its employees. It expects to make the

employer shall not be liable in any manner for any insufficiency in
the pension fund; benefits are payable only from the pension fund,
and only to the extent that there are monies available therein.
(4) The pension fund will consist of all funds held by the employer
under the plan, including contributions made pursuant to the
provisions hereof and the investments, reinvestments and proceeds
thereof. The pension fund shall be held, managed, and

otherwise expressly provided in the plan, the employer has
exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the
pension fund assets. The employer may, however, appoint a trustee,
custodian and/or investment manager, at its sole discretion.
B. Powers and duties of employer. With respect to the pension fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition
to those vested in it elsewhere in the plan or by law, unless such duties
are delegated.

thereon.

of the powers, rights, and privileges conferred upon trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be

take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the employer may deem
necessary to administer the pension fund.

respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.

commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this
plan with assets of other eligible, participating plans through such
a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the plan
which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to
all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan, to
the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled
trust fund by the plan.
(11) To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the plan, provided that if a trustee is
appointed by the employer, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the employer.
(12) To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the plan.

applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the employer, taking into account the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
(16) To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all

or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the
Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as defined in that act),
or is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or dispose

investment manager or managers with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it be
under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any fund

investments.
D. Compensation and expenses of appointed trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable
compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by
law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out its functions, shall constitute a charge upon the
employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after
30 days written notice to the employer. the employer shall be under no
obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of its failure
to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to be
reimbursed for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.

as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and
such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other
transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
F. Value of the pension fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the pension fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities
thereof, shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose
decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto,
the participants and beneficiaries and their estates. in making any such
determination, the employer or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely
upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers

he is entitled under this plan with respect to contributions
previously made;
(2) That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held

accrued benefit to the date.
(2) If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for all

other sources hereunder.

distributed and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of
applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by the

remaining balance, in excess of employer contributions, shall be
returned to the commonwealth.
F. Exclusive benefit rule. In the event of the discontinuance and
termination of the plan as provided herein, the employer shall dispose
of the pension fund in accordance with the terms of the plan and
applicable law; at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the plan shall any part of the corpus or income of the pension fund,
after deducting any administrative or other expenses properly
chargeable to the pension fund, be used for or diverted to purposes

and benefit the plan; and further provided, that the plan
administrator shall document all such expenses item by item
and, where necessary, hour by hour.
B. Duties of chief administrative officer.
(1) Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the
supervision of the chief administrative officer.

which estimate shall disclose to the Council the impact of the proposed
benefit plan modification on the future financial requirements of the
plan and the future minimum municipal obligation of the employer with
respect to the plan.

nor anyone else shall have any rights whatsoever against the employer

of law rules.
D. Headings. The headings of articles are included solely for convenience
of reference, and if there be any conflict between such headings and the
text of the plan, the text shall control.
E. Severability of provisions. In case any provisions of this plan shall be
held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not
affect the remaining parts of this plan, and the plan shall be construed
and enforced as if said illegal and invalid provisions had never been
inserted therein.
F. Incapacity of participant. If any participant shall be physically or
mentally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any
payment of pension benefits hereunder, the plan administrator, upon
the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such participant is so
incapacitated and that another person or institution is maintaining him,
may provide for such payment of pension benefits hereunder to such
person or institution so maintaining him, and any such payments so
made shall be deemed for every purpose to have been made to such
participant.

to the plan administrator (and where applicable, the trustee)
information in the employer's possession as the plan administrator and
the trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under
the plan.
K. Benefits for a deceased participant. If any benefit shall be payable
under the plan to or on behalf of a participant who has died, if the plan
provides that the payment of such benefits shall be made to the
participant's estate, and if no administration of such participant's estate
is pending in the court of proper jurisdiction, then the plan
administrator, at its sole option, may pay such benefits to the surviving
spouse of such deceased participant, or, if there is no surviving spouse,
to such participant's then living issue, per stirpes; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent the plan administrator from
insisting upon the commencement of estate administration proceedings
and the delivery of any such benefits to a duly appointed executor or
administrator.

otherwise specifically required by other applicable laws, no past,

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 300-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,18 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of Etna does hereby order
as follows.
§ 300-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 300-3. Applicability.
§ 300-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough of Etna unless a permit has
been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
B. A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or
structures of which the cost of repairs is less than 50% of market value
of the structure.

1:85
§ 300-5. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
§ 300-6. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of Etna
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.

[Adopted 6-16-1998 by Ord. No. 1252]
§ 470-26. Definitions.
FOOD PREPARATION FACILITY  Includes any food establishment in any
building, room or place or any portion thereof or appurtenance thereto,
where human food or drink is mixed, cooked or otherwise prepared, offered
for sale, sold, served or given with or without charge to patrons, customers
or guests for consumption on the premises; provided, however, that this
does not include the mixing, cooking, or other preparation and serving of
food in residential dwellings.
GREASE INTERCEPTOR  An interceptor whose rated flow exceeds 35
gpm and which is located underground outside the building.
GREASE TRAP  An interceptor whose flow rate is 35 gpm or less and
which is located inside the building. Grease traps shall be rated for a
minimum 22.5 gpm.
RESTAURANT  Includes any public eating place where regular meals are
prepared, offered for sale, sold and served to patrons, customers or guests
for compensation based on the price charged for and generally paid at
the conclusion of each meal. The words "regular meals," as used herein,
mean meals generally consisting of courses embracing some kind of meat
or its equivalent, vegetables, bread, pastry, beverage and accompaniments,
served at more or less regular intervals.
§ 470-27. Plumbing to be in good repair.
Every building or room occupied or used as a public eating place or
restaurant shall be well drained. All soil pipes, waste pipes, drains or other
plumbing fixtures shall be of adequate size to enable a passage of any waste
intended to pass through it to the main public sewer. All drains, sewers,
waste and soil pipes, traps and water in gas pipes shall, at all times, be kept
in good repair and order so that no gases or odor shall escape therefrom
and so that the same shall not leak, and all vent pipes shall be kept in good
order and repair and free from obstructions.
§ 470-28. Installation of grease interceptors and traps.
A. Every building, room or space or part thereof used as a restaurant or
food preparation facility, whether new or existing, shall install or cause
to be installed a grease interceptor or grease trap. The type of
installation shall be determined by the total fixture flow-through rate of
potential grease-laden fixtures discharging through the building
sewage lines as determined by the Allegheny County Health
Department Plumbing Division. For flow-through rates, 35 gpm or less,
an internal grease trap may be installed in certain existing structures
used as restaurants and food preparation facilities. For flow-through
rates exceeding 35 gpm, an external underground grease interceptor
§ 470-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 470-28

installed a grease interceptor or grease trap as determined by flowthrough
rate, as detailed above. In existing facilities where it is
determined by the Borough that a grease trap is not sufficient, the
Borough may require that a grease interceptor (as detailed above) be
installed. Such insufficiency shall be evidenced by excessive amounts of
grease being discharged into the public sewer system by a facility. All
existing restaurants or food preparation facilities shall, at a change of
ownership or alteration, install an exterior, underground grease
interceptor of a minimum 1,000 gallons' capacity. In all existing
structures, building or parts thereof in which there is a change of use or
occupancy to that of a restaurant or food preparation facility there shall
be installed a grease interceptor, minimum 1,000 gallons' capacity,
regardless of flow-through rate.
A. All grease interceptors and grease traps shall be maintained and kept in
good working order at all times. The interceptor or trap shall limit the
amount of grease discharged into the public sewer system to levels not
exceeding those permitted by the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority
(ALCOSAN). Oil/grease discharge shall not exceed 200 ppm
downstream of the interceptor or trap.
B. It shall be the duty and responsibility of any owner, lessee or agent of
any restaurant or food preparation facility to, at a minimum of annually,
inspect the grease interceptor or trap. A written record shall be kept of
all inspections. The inspection record shall, at a minimum, list the name
(inspector and company), address, phone number of the inspection/
disposal company, the method and frequency of cleaning schedule and
the date of the cleaning/inspection. Such records shall be presented to

effective disconnection with the following guidelines:
The point of discharge must be:
(1) A minimum of two feet from a building without a basement;
A minimum of six feet from a building with a basement (10 feet if
installing a dry well);
(2)
(3) Not less than five feet from a neighbor's property;
(4) Not less than 10 feet from a neighbor's building;
(5) Not less than 10 feet from a retaining wall.

Borough Council that the removal of garbage and other refuse material is
paramount to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Borough,
and the improper removal of garbage or other refuse material may lead to
the development of unsanitary conditions and the creation of nuisances. It
is the further intent of the Council of the Borough of Etna to impose and/or
collect reasonable fees and charges for the removal of garbage and refuse,
since it is no longer economically feasible for the Borough to provide for the
same from the general tax revenue.

sewage bill and due within 30 days of issuance. If payment is not made
within the aforesaid time, a 10% penalty shall be added to the fees as
set forth in § 510-7 of this article.
B. Authority is hereby given to the Council of the Borough of Etna to
increase, decrease, or change in any way the garbage collection fees by
means of a resolution.
A. The fees and charges to be imposed for the care and removal of garbage
and other refuse materials, which includes the annual cost for the
"tipping fee" at the landfill site, shall be as set from time to time by
resolution of the Borough Council. A senior citizen family may qualify
for a lesser fee. [Amended 5-19-2020 by Ord. No. 1383]
B. For the purpose of this section, "senior citizen family" shall be defined
as heads of households whose age is 65 years or older or any head of
household who is totally disabled and is qualified for Medicare.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 518-1. Purpose.
In order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the residents
of the municipality, as well as to protect, sustain and enhance the surface
water and groundwater resources of the municipality, drainage and
stormwater management practices shall be utilized as directed herein to
achieve the following goals and objectives:
A. Accommodate site development and redevelopment in a manner that
protects public safety and that is consistent with (or reestablishes) the
natural hydrologic characteristics of each watershed and sustains
groundwater recharge, stream base flows, stable stream channel
(geomorphology) conditions, the carrying capacity of streams and their
floodplains, groundwater and surface water quality, and aquatic living
resources and their habitats.
B. Reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated.
C. Protect natural infiltration and groundwater recharge rates in order to
sustain groundwater supplies and stream base flows.
D. Maintain runoff characteristics of the site after completion of
development that are consistent with the carrying capacity and stable
channel conditions of the receiving streams.
E. Protect water quality by removing and/or treating pollutants prior to
discharge to groundwater and surface waters throughout the
municipality, and to protect, restore, and maintain the chemical,
physical and biological quality of groundwater and surface waters.
F. Protect against scour, aggradation, degradation in stream channels and
geomorphology conditions of the receiving streams, protect their floodcarrying
capacity and aquatic habitats and reduce in-stream erosion
and sedimentation.
G. Reduce flooding impacts and prevent a significant increase in surface
runoff rates and volumes, predevelopment to post-development, which
could worsen flooding downstream in the watershed, enlarge
floodplains, erode stream banks and create other flood-related healthwelfare-
property losses; in general, to preserve and restore the natural
flood-carrying capacity of streams and their floodplains.
H. Protect adjacent lands from adverse impacts of direct stormwater
discharges.
I. Ensure effective long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities.
J. Maintain natural drainage patterns and encourage the use of natural
drainage systems.

and streams in the municipality, and protect and/or restore natural
hydrologic characteristics and habitats wherever possible throughout
the watershed systems.
M. Address certain requirements of the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) Phase II Stormwater Regulations.
N. Reduce the impacts of runoff from existing developed sites undergoing
redevelopment while encouraging development and redevelopment in
urban areas and areas designated for growth.
O. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
"existing uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support those
uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in
"special protection" streams.
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).

I. If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity the municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to Subsection J. The proposed area of
disturbance shall be less than one acre. The request for a modification
or waiver shall originate with the landowner, shall be in writing, and
shall accompany the stormwater management site plan submitted to
the municipality. The request shall provide the facts on which the
request is based, the provisions of the chapter involved, and the
proposed modification. The designated plan reviewer shall review the
request to determine if it meets the requirements of the chapter,
including Subsection J below. If acceptable to the municipality, the
municipality may grant the waiver or modification.
J. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of unique physical circumstances or conditions peculiar to the
land in question, provided that the modifications will not be contrary or
detrimental to the public interest and will achieve the intended
outcome and that the purpose of the chapter is preserved. Hardship

for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater
management site plan submission, as directed in Subsection I above.
K. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be
granted by the municipality. Municipalities are responsible for
reviewing proposed waivers/modifications. The waiver must come from
the landowner and be presented in writing along with a stormwater
management site plan. The designated plan reviewer shall determine if
the plan meets the requirements of the chapter including the new
paragraph in Subsection J above. If the proposed disturbance is one
acre or greater, it must be approved by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated county conservation
district.
A. The management of stormwater on site, both during and upon
completion of the disturbances associated with activities permitted
under § 518-4, shall be accomplished in accordance with the standards
and criteria of this chapter. The design of any temporary or permanent
facilities and structures and the utilization of any natural drainage
systems shall be in full compliance with this article.
B. The intent of these design standards is to encourage environmentally
sound stormwater management practices that provide necessary
drainage facilities while protecting the hydrologic characteristics and
water quality of the site and watershed. Developments shall be required
to incorporate stormwater management controls. Stormwater
management design shall blend into the natural environment and be
aesthetically integrated into the site design.
(1) Applicants shall refer to the Pennsylvania Storm Water Best
Management Practices Manual, as amended, Pennsylvania
Handbook of Best Management Practices for Developing Areas
(PACD, 1998), the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual
(MDE, 2000) or other appropriate references for guidance in the
design of stormwater management facilities most appropriate to
individual site conditions. Objectives for design are to reduce the
volume of stormwater generated, infiltrate runoff at its source to
the maximum extent possible, achieve water quality improvement
at the source or during conveyance and provide for peak flow
attenuation. Applicants shall examine design alternatives by
viewing them in a series. In addition, applicants are strongly
encouraged to use structural and nonstructural stormwater
management practices that reduce or eliminate the need for
detention basins.
§ 518-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-7
1:233
(2) All SWM design work must be completed by a qualified design
professional. All designs proposing the use of a SWM retention or
detention facility with outlet structure(s) shall be completed by a
professional engineer licensed in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
(3) All development activity within a special flood hazard area
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) shall comply with all sections of the Etna Floodplain
Ordinance No. 1353 of 201442 and this paragraph. All development
shall be designed to maintain the flood-carrying capacity of the
floodway such that the base flood elevations are not increased,
either upstream or downstream, unless an approval is received
from PADEP. The natural conveyance characteristics of the site and
the receiving floodplain shall be incorporated into the stormwater
management practices proposed for the site.
(4) The stormwater management system shall not create an adverse
impact on stormwater quantity or quality in either upstream or
downstream areas. Off-site areas which discharge to or across a
site proposed for development shall be addressed in the
stormwater management plan prepared for the development. No
stormwater management plan shall be approved until it is
demonstrated that the runoff from the project shall not adversely
impact downstream areas.
(5) Wetlands shall not be used to meet the minimum design
requirements for stormwater management or stormwater runoff
quality treatment, except when used as part of a treatment train
that incorporates a portion of the outer zone (filter strip) of the
wetland's riparian buffer as a stormwater outfall.
(6) All proposed stormwater management systems shall be designed to
prevent the pollution of groundwater resources by stormwater,
promote safety, minimize health hazards, preserve natural features
and provide infiltration and groundwater recharge where
appropriate. Neither submission of a plan under the provision
herein nor compliance with the provisions of these regulations shall
relieve any person from responsibility for damage to any person or
property otherwise imposed by law.
(7) Where deemed necessary by the Municipal Engineer, or as
addressed in an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan,
the applicant shall construct storm drains to handle on-site runoff;
to the maximum extent permitted under the Municipalities
Planning Code and Act 167, or any amendments thereto, provide
on-site/off-site drainage easements; and provide for the conveyance
of off-site runoff to an acceptable outlet in the same watershed.

§ 518-7 ETNA CODE § 518-7
1:234
(8) Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easements shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, except as needed for
roadways, driveways and walkways, or any alterations that may
adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portions of the
easement and require the establishment and protection of riparian
buffers.
(9) For all regulated activities, stormwater management BMPs shall be
designed, implemented, operated and maintained to meet the
purposes and requirements of this chapter and to meet all
requirements under Pa. Code Title 25, the Clean Streams Law, and
the Storm Water Management Act.
(10) Any regulated activity that may affect the stormwater flows toward
or onto a state or county highway right-of-way or facility shall be
designed, implemented, operated, and maintained in accordance
with the regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PennDOT) or Allegheny County, as the case may
be.
(11) At the time of application for a building permit for any approved lot
created by a subdivision and/or improved as a land development
project, issuance of the permit shall be conditioned upon
adherence to the terms of this chapter.
(12) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(e.g., special protection waters, cold water fisheries, recharge
areas, water supply reservoirs, etc.) may be subject to additional
performance criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain
stormwater management practices.
(13) For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated and
maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g.,
during construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this
chapter and to meet all requirements under the Pa. Code Title 25
and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs and their design
standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual (E&S Manual), Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
Department of Environmental Protection, No. 363-2134-008, as
amended and updated.
(14)No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality
shall commence until the requirements of this chapter are met.

A. Design goals. Applicants shall adhere to a holistic design process
incorporating the goals listed below. The objective is to achieve postdevelopment
hydrologic conditions that are consistent with the
predevelopment ground cover assumption for new development (refer
§ 518-15 ETNA CODE § 518-16
1:244
to § 518-17B) and improve the runoff conditions for redevelopment
[refer to § 518-16C(3)]. The design goals are to:
(1) Minimize the volume of runoff that must be collected, conveyed,
treated and released by stormwater management facilities;
Note: Minimization of runoff generated by a proposed site is
directly related to the various land use and design standards for
site improvements required under the municipal zoning and
subdivision and land development ordinances. The effect that these
requirements have on generating stormwater should be taken into
consideration. Site design should implement runoff reduction
techniques such as those described in Appendix B.45
(2) Maintain the natural infiltration process and rate, and infiltrate
runoff at its source when appropriate;
(3) Remove and/or treat pollutants at the source or during conveyance;
(4) Provide for peak flow attenuation, as needed; and
(5) Attenuate runoff to protect the in-stream channel of the receiving
stream.
B. General principles. The following general principles apply to all
applicable activities pursuant to § 518-4:
(1) Incorporate conservation design practices to minimize the amount
of stormwater generated on a site, encourage the disconnection of
impervious land cover, and maximize the use of pervious areas for
stormwater treatment and on-site rainfall infiltration.
Note: Design standards in other sections of the municipal
subdivision and land development ordinance should be evaluated
for their impact on generating stormwater runoff. For example,
standards for parking stall sizes, quantity of parking, roadway
widths, yard and bulk area requirements for each zoning district
can inadvertently work against the minimization of stormwater
generated. Also, pervious areas such as recreation fields may be
available for the installation of stormwater facilities thereby
maximizing the use of pervious areas. A brief description of
suggested site design practices is provided in Appendix B.46
(2) Infiltration of surface water runoff at its source is to be a
mechanism for stormwater management based on hydrologic soil
group (or infiltration testing). Infiltration practices include, but are
not limited to, those referenced in § 518-18B(1) and as outlined in
the publications listed in § 518-18. Infiltration practices shall
adhere to the following criteria:
45.Editor's Note: Appendix B is an attachment to this chapter.
46.Editor's Note: Appendix B is an attachment to this chapter.
§ 518-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-16
1:245
(a) In choosing methods of infiltration, preference shall be given to
a combination of surface and subsurface infiltration methods.
(b) Applicants shall first consider minimum disturbance/minimum
maintenance techniques combined with site grading that
distributes runoff to reduce concentration. Next, applicants
shall consider depression areas combined with subsurface
infiltration practices followed by other subsurface measures,
including, but not limited to, porous paving and perforated
pipe storage.
(c) The use of multiple infiltration features and facilities that
provide for the following is encouraged:
[1] Discourage concentration of flows;
[2] Encourage disconnection of flows;
[3] Infiltrate as close to the source of runoff as possible; and
[4] Reduce visual impact.
Note: An example of promoting the concepts listed in
§ 518-16B(2)(c) is choosing a design method to address
runoff collected from rooftops and conveyed to the surface
by downspouts. The "disconnection of flows" can be
accomplished by directing the downspouts over pervious
surfaces rather than impervious surfaces. This can be
taken one step further by directing the downspouts into
infiltration facilities close to the source of the runoff. This
promotes the idea of infiltrating as close to the source of
runoff as possible and discourages the concentration of
flows.
(d) Where high water tables, subsurface contamination, slope
stability concerns, or other site constraints preclude achieving
the required infiltration volume, additional conservation
design practices and alternative stormwater management
practices should be implemented to reduce to the maximum
extent practicable the total volume of stormwater released to
streams. Applicant shall follow the stormwater runoff
hierarchy of § 518-18A(1).
(e) Infiltration areas should be designed to maintain any broad
and even infiltration pattern which existed prior to
development. Such facilities should use the natural topography
and vegetation in order to blend in with the site. Infiltration
designs which do not provide this may be used if the applicant
demonstrates to the municipality's satisfaction that alternative
approaches would be more effective, more harmonious with
their existing environment and as easily maintained.
§ 518-16 ETNA CODE § 518-16
1:246
(f) Aboveground stormwater infiltration facilities should be as
shallow as possible while still achieving the requirements of
this chapter.
(3) Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction with or
as part of infiltration practices. Water quality improvements shall
also be provided for drainage areas not otherwise addressed by
infiltration practices either at the source of runoff and/or during
conveyance away from the source of runoff.
(4) To reduce the need for large retention and/or detention basins
designed to satisfy the peak flow attenuation and extended
detention requirements, other innovative stormwater management
practices located close to the source of runoff generation shall be
considered, including a combination of practices (e.g., rooftop
storage, open-vegetated channels, bioretention, pervious pavement
systems and infiltration trenches).
(5) When designing stormwater management facilities to satisfy the
peak flow attenuation and extended detention requirements [refer
to § 518-16C(2)(b)], the effect of structural and nonstructural
stormwater management practices implemented as part of the
overall site design may be taken into consideration when
calculating total storage volume and release rates.
(6) Site hydrology and natural infiltration patterns shall guide site
design, construction and vegetation decisions. All channels,
drainageways, swales, natural streams and other surface water
concentrations shall be considered and, where possible,
incorporated into design decisions.
C. Minimum performance criteria.
(1) The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all
applicable activities, whether they are new development or
redevelopment, pursuant to § 518-4A.
(a) Water quality treatment of stormwater runoff shall be provided
for all discharges prior to release to a receiving water body. If a
stormwater management practice does not provide water
quality treatment, then water quality best management
practices shall be utilized prior to the runoff entering the
stormwater management practice.
(b) Water quality management shall be provided through the use
of structural and/or nonstructural stormwater management
practices. Water quality stormwater management practices
shall be designed to reduce or eliminate solids, sediment,
nutrients and other potential pollutants from the site. It is
presumed that a stormwater management practice complies
with this requirement if it is:
§ 518-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-16
1:247
[1] Designed according to the specific performance criteria
outlined in § 518-6C.
[2] Constructed in accordance with all permits and approved
plans and specifications; and
[3] Maintained per an approved operations and maintenance
plan or agreement or, in lieu of that, in accordance with
customary practices.
(c) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential for pollutant loadings (hot spots) may require the use
of specific structural stormwater management practices and
pollution prevention practices. In addition, stormwater from a
hot spot land use shall be provided with proper pretreatment
prior to infiltration. For the purpose of this chapter, the sites/
facilities listed in § 518-16C(1)(d) below are considered hot
spots.
(d) Certain industrial sites may be required to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan and file
notice of intent as required under the provision of the EPA
Industrial Stormwater NPDES Permit Requirements. Other
industrial sites storing significant quantities of chemicals/
wastes should also prepare a prevention plan. Sites that are
required by EPA to prepare a plan include, but are not limited
to:
[1] Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities;
[2] Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities;
[3] Fleet storage areas for buses, trucks, etc.;
[4] Marinas (service and maintenance);
[5] Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials.
Note: Municipalities may add more quantifiable standards
regarding the meaning of "significant quantities of
chemicals/waste." For example, the 2000 International
Building Code Table 307.7(1) gives maximum allowable
chemicals regarding hazardous materials posing a
physical hazard. The PADEP spill prevention control
program may also provide guidance. Additional categories
of land use could be added to this list as warranted.
(e) Conveyance structures/channels shall be designed and
adequately sized to protect the properties receiving runoff
from impacts of flooding and erosion. Where necessary, and to
the maximum extent permitted under the Municipalities
Planning Code and Act 167, or any amendments thereto,
drainage easement from adjoining properties shall be obtained
§ 518-16 ETNA CODE § 518-16
1:248
to ensure the drainageway and the property and shall also
establish the operation and maintenance requirements for the
drainageway.
(f) All stormwater management practices shall have an operations
and maintenance plan pursuant to § 518-27 of this chapter, and
if to be privately owned, an enforceable operation and
maintenance agreement per § 518-28 of this chapter to ensure
the system functions as designed and to provide remedies for
system failure.
Note: This model ordinance includes a sample operation and
maintenance agreement document (refer to Appendix C47).
Municipalities should consult with their legal counsel on
contents of any agreement prepared for operation and
maintenance of stormwater management facilities. The PADEP
document titled "Guidance on MS4 Ordinance Provisions,
document number 392-0300-003, dated August 2, 2003, should
be consulted for further guidance.
(g) Stormwater runoff generated from development and
discharged directly into a jurisdictional wetland or waters of
the United States and their adjacent wetlands shall be treated
by an approved stormwater management practice prior to
release into a natural wetlands and shall not be used to meet
the minimum design requirements for stormwater
management or stormwater runoff quality treatment, except
when used as part of a treatment train that incorporates a
portion of the outer zone (filter strip) of the wetland's riparian
buffer as a stormwater outfall. In such instances, the discharge
velocity from the terminal end of a pipe or associated energy
dissipation practice shall not exceed two feet per second for
the two-year frequency storm event. Where such a
management strategy is used, all feasible methods shall be
used to convert concentrated flow to uniform, shallow sheet
flow before entering the outer zone of the wetland's riparian
buffer. In addition, it shall be demonstrated that such an
approach will not cause erosion.
(2) The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all
applicable new development activities, pursuant to § 518-4A.
(a) Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction
with or as part of infiltration practices (if used). Water quality
improvements shall also be provided for drainage areas not
otherwise addressed by infiltration practices either at the
source of runoff and/or during conveyance away from the
source of runoff. Stormwater quality management practices
shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff
47.Editor's Note: Appendix C is an attachment to this chapter.
§ 518-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-16
1:249
generated by the one-inch rainfall event. Refer to § 518-18A(2)
for water quality volume design standards and assumptions.
Stormwater quality management practice selection, design
and implementation shall be based upon appropriate reference
materials, as provided in § 518-6C.
(b) The post-development peak discharge rate shall not exceed the
predevelopment peak discharge rate multiplied by the
"subbasin release rate percentage" (where determined in Act
167 watersheds) for the two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year,
and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storm events pursuant
to the predevelopment cover assumption described in
§ 518-17B. Refer to Appendix A for release rate percentages
information.48
(c) Facilities capable of attenuating rainfall runoff shall be
provided and be designed to attenuate the runoff volume from
the one-year twenty-four-hour storm event for at least 24
hours.
(d) Stormwater shall be infiltrated and/or discharged within the
same drainage area of the stream receiving the runoff from the
development site prior to development.
(e) Structural and nonstructural stormwater management
practices that make best possible use of infiltration on site
shall be considered in all site designs, when appropriate.
(3) The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all
applicable redevelopment activities, pursuant to § 518-4B.
Note: The intent of § 518-16C(3) is to accommodate redevelopment
that is designed to provide improved stormwater management
while recognizing that redevelopment sites have inherent physical
constraints, which may make the application of the new
development stormwater design parameters difficult to achieve.
(a) One of the following minimum performance standards shall be
accomplished. Selection of the performance standard shall be
whichever is most appropriate for the given site conditions:
[1] Reduce the total impervious cover on the site (e.g., by
using pervious pavement, replacement of pavement with
pervious planting areas or green roof systems) by at least
25%, based on a comparison of existing impervious cover
to proposed impervious cover; or
[2] Provide facilities designed to attenuate the runoff volume
from the one-year twenty-four-hour post-development
storm event for at least 24 hours; or
48.Editor's Note: Appendix A is an attachment to this chapter.
§ 518-16 ETNA CODE § 518-16
1:250
§ 518-17. Stormwater runoff calculation criteria.
In addition to the infiltration and water quality requirements of this chapter,
peak flow from those activities resulting in increases in impervious surface
and/or regrading and compaction shall be attenuated consistent with the
following stormwater calculation methods:
[3] Provide facilities to ensure that the post-development peak
discharge rate shall not exceed the predevelopment peak
discharge rate multiplied by the "subbasin release rate
percentage" (where determined in Act 167 watersheds) for
the two-year and ten-year twenty-four-hour storm events.
A predevelopment cover CN of 71 shall be assumed.
(b) In addition to the minimum performance standards for
redevelopment areas in § 518-16C(3) above, water quality
improvements shall be provided for drainage areas not
otherwise addressed by infiltration practices either at the
source of runoff and/or during conveyance away from the
source of runoff. Stormwater quality management facilities
shall be designed to capture and treat 0.25 inch of runoff from
all pavement areas (i.e., parking lots, pavements and
noncovered sidewalks). Roof area may be excluded from this
calculation.
A. Values to apply.
(1) The following design storms shall be used for analysis of the preand
post-development conditions. These values are applicable to
the Soil-Cover-Complex Method:
Return Period
(years)
24-Hour Storm
(inches)
1 2.00
2 2.35
10 3.30
25 3.91
100 4.92
(2) The precipitation values for each frequency storm listed above
were abstracted from the precipitation frequency estimates
developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration as set forth in NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 (NOAA June
2004). The NOAA data are available from the Hydrometeorological
Design Studies Center of the National Weather Service.
The NOAA Atlas 14, volume 2 report can be accessed from the
NOAA website at http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
§ 518-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-17
1:251
B. The following assumptions shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For new development sites, the ground cover used as the
predevelopment assumption for runoff calculations shall be as
follows;
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of woodland in good
condition. Portions of a site having more than one viable tree of
a diameter at breast height (DBH) (the diameter of the tree
stem 4 1/2 feet above the ground) of six inches or greater per
1,500 square feet shall be considered wooded where such trees
existed within 10 years of application. If there is evidence of
logging within the ten-year period the logged area shall be
consider as woodland in good condition.
Note: The intent of Subsection B(1)(a) is to recognize woodland
conditions and not inadvertently encourage tree harvesting.
(b) Agricultural sites shall use a ground cover of pasture in good
condition.
(c) All other portions of a site shall use a ground cover of meadow
in good condition.
(d) All watershed area(s) contributing to the point of interest,
including off-site area, shall be considered.
(e) For redevelopment sites, see § 518-16C(3).
(2) The runoff curve numbers listed in the table below shall be used in
developing the runoff calculations for the ground covers noted in
Subsection B(1).These values are referenced from the Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds Technical Release No. 55 (USDA,
1986). Coefficients for equivalent ground cover conditions shall be
used if a runoff method other than the Soil-Cover-Complex Method
is used.

(4) Gravel pavement shall have a curve number of 89.
(5) Average antecedent moisture conditions, or AMC II, shall be used
(for the Soil-Cover-Complex Method, only for example, TR-55,
TR-20).
§ 518-17 ETNA CODE § 518-17
1:252
(6) A type II distribution storm (for the Soil-Cover-Complex Method,
only for example, TR-55, TR-20).
(7) For time-of-concentration calculations, sheet flow lengths shall not
exceed 100 feet and shallow concentrated flow lengths shall not
exceed 1,000 feet.
(8) The kinematic "n" value in the sheet flow equation should be
applied as per the following table. (Values taken from TR-55.)
Impervious surfaces 0.011
Agricultural lands 0.17
Grass, lawn or open
space
0.24
Wooded areas 0.40
C. In all plans and designs for stormwater management systems and
facilities submitted to the Municipal Engineer for approval, stormwater
peak discharge and runoff shall be determined through the use of the
NRCS Soil-Cover-Complex Method as set forth in Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55 (USDA, 1986), with
specific attention given to antecedent moisture conditions, flood
routing, time of concentration, and peak discharge specifications
included therein and in Hydrology National Engineering Handbook,
Section 4, (USDA, 1985), both by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service. Note that when TR-55 is used
for natural system-based approaches and practices encouraged herein,
calculations must be performed on a detailed small subarea basis. Use
of Technical Release No. 20 and other methods listed in Table 1 are also
acceptable. The design professional's selection of a specific method
shall be based on the suitability of the method for the given project site
conditions with due consideration to the limitations of the method
chosen. Table 1 herein summarizes the computational methods
available:

D. A Modified Rational Method analysis may be used for drainage areas
smaller than two acres when permitted by the Municipal Engineer. The
term "Modified Rational Method" used herein refers to a procedure for
manipulation of the basic Rational Method techniques to reflect the fact
that storms with a duration greater than the normal time of
concentration for a basin will result in a larger volume of runoff even
though the peak discharge is reduced. The methodology and model
chosen for use shall be well documented as being appropriate for use in
this region, and all relevant assumptions, methodologies, calculations
and data used shall be provided to the Municipal Engineer for review.
Information on the Modified Rational Method is presented in the
"Recommended Hydrologic Procedures for Computing Urban Runoff
from Small Watersheds in Pennsylvania" (PADEP, 1982).
E. Rainfall intensities used for the Modified Rational Method shall be
based on the precipitation frequency estimates developed by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as set forth in NOAA
Atlas 14.
F. The Rational Method (that is, Q = CIA) shall be used for calculations of
the peak rate of runoff for the design of storm sewers and drainage
swales but not for the design of stormwater management facilities
where a full hydrograph is needed. The equation representing the
Rational Method is comprised of the following (in English units):
(1) Q = Peak flow rate, cubic feet per second (cfs).

§ 518-18. Standards for stormwater management practices.
The Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual shall
serve as a guide for the design of stormwater management practices.
Additional design guidance may also be obtained from other related
sources, including the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual, Volumes
I and II (MDE, 2000), Design of Stormwater Filtering Systems (CWP, 1996),

development. A list of references is provided with this chapter. The water
quality volume design measures used herein are partially based on the
methodology expressed in the Maryland manual referenced above.
Pursuant to the design options recommended in the above documents, the
following standards shall be adhered to:
(2) C = Runoff coefficient, dependent on land use/cover.
(3) I = Design rainfall intensity, inches per hour.
(4) A = Drainage area, acres.
G. Runoff characteristics of off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development shall be considered and be based on the existing
conditions in the off-site area.
A. Extended detention, water quality volume, infiltration and
nonstructural BMP credits criteria. The following sizing criteria shall be
followed at all sites required to meet the standards of this chapter.
(1) Extended detention.
(a) Detain the one-year, twenty-four-hour design storm using the
SCS Type II distribution. Provisions shall be made so that the
one-year storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the
facility from a point where the maximum volume of water from
the one-year storm is captured (i.e., the maximum water
surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water
can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water
quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The design of the
facility shall consider and minimize the chances of clogging
and sedimentation potential.
(b) Detention ponds shall detain the one-year storm event and
allow it to naturally infiltrate and recharge the groundwater
table. All subsequent orifices for the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and
one-hundred-year storm events shall be placed above the
maximum water surface elevation of the one-year storm.
(c) Flow from off-site areas must be considered as pass-through
flow if it is conveyed through the BMP and should be modeled
as "present condition" for the one-year storm event.
§ 518-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:255
(d) The length of overland flow used in time of concentration (Tc)
calculations is limited to no more than 100 feet for postdevelopment
conditions.
(e) The models TR-55 and TR-20 (or approved equivalent) can be
used for determining peak discharge rates.
(2) Water quality volume.
(a) Treatment of the water quality volume (WQv) of stormwater
prior to its release to receiving waters or water bodies shall be
provided at all developments where stormwater management
is required. The WQv equals the storage volume needed to
capture and treat the runoff from storms of one inch or less.
Runoff from the first one inch of rainfall transports most of the
total pollutant load.
The WQv is based on the following equation:
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12 (acre-feet)
Where:
P = rainfall depth in inches (set to 1 inch)
Rv = volumetric runoff coefficient, 0.05 + 0.009(I)
where I is percent impervious cover
A = site area (acres).
(b) The formula assumes approximately 5% runoff from pervious
surfaces and 90% runoff from impervious surfaces. A minimum
of 0.2 inches per acre of runoff volume shall be met at sites or
in drainage areas that have less than 15% impervious cover.
(c) Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no proposed
disturbance during development may be excluded from the
WQv calculations. However, designers are encouraged to
incorporate water quality treatment practices for these areas.
(d) Stormwater quality treatment. The final WQv shall be treated
by an acceptable stormwater management practice(s) from
those described in this section or as approved by the
municipality.
(e) For new developments and redevelopments, infiltration is
considered an acceptable method of satisfying part or all of the
water quality volume.
(f) For new developments, the WQv requirements of this section
shall be sized and designed in conjunction with the standards
under § 518-18A(1).
(g) As a basis for design, the following assumptions may be made:
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:256
[1] Multiple drainage areas. When a project contains or is
divided by multiple drainage areas, the WQv volume shall
be addressed for each drainage area.
[2] Off-site drainage areas. The WQv shall be based on the
impervious cover of the proposed site. Off-site existing
impervious areas may be excluded from the calculation of
the water quality volume requirements.
(3) Infiltration volume. Where possible, all of the water quality volume
should be treated using infiltration BMPs. The following calculation
shall be used to determine the minimum recharge goal for the site:
Recharge volume (Rev), (acre-feet)
Fraction of WQv, depending on soil hydrologic group.
Rev = (S)(Ai); where: S = soil specific recharge factor in inches
Ai = the measured impervious cover
Hydrologic Soil Group Soil Specific Recharge Factor (S)
A 0.40 inches
B 0.25 inches of runoff
C 0.10 inches of runoff
D 0.05 inches of runoff
(a) Infiltrated volume may be subtracted from the total site WQv.
(b) Infiltration should not be considered for sites or areas of sites
that have activities that may allow pollution to be infiltrated.
For example, the use of infiltration for the runoff of a service
station's paved lot would not be appropriate, although roof
water from the service station may be infiltrated.
(c) Infiltration should only be used when, in the opinion of a
professional engineer, it will not contribute to slope instability
or cause seepage problems into basements or developed
downgradient areas.
(d) If more than one hydrologic soil group is present at a site, a
composite recharge volume shall be computed based upon the
proportion of total site area within each hydrologic soil group.
(e) All infiltration facilities shall be set back at least 15 feet from
all structures with subgrade elements (e.g., basements,
foundation walls).
(4) Credits for use of nonstructural BMPs. The developer may obtain
credits for the use of nonstructural BMPs using the procedures
outlined below. Examples of nonstructural credit calculations are
provided in Appendix E.49
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:257
(a) Volume Reduction Method #1: natural area conservation.
[1] A water quality volume reduction can be taken when
undisturbed natural areas are conserved on a site, thereby
retaining their predevelopment hydrologic and water
quality characteristics. Under this method, a designer
would be able to subtract the conservation areas from the
total site area when computing the water quality
protection volume. An added benefit is that the postdevelopment
peak discharges will be smaller, and hence,
water quantity control volumes will be reduced due to
lower post-development curve numbers or Rational
Formula "C" values.
[2] Rule. Subtract conservation areas from total site area
when computing water quality protection volume
requirements.
[3] Criteria:
[a] Conservation area cannot be disturbed during project
construction and must be protected from sediment
deposition. The conservation area shall be protected
with a safety fence until construction has been
completed. After construction, the area shall be
posted with signage indicating that it is a conservation
area.
[b] Shall be protected by limits of disturbance clearly
shown on all construction drawings.
[c] Shall be located within an acceptable conservation
easement instrument that ensures perpetual
protection of the proposed area. The easement must
clearly specify how the natural area vegetation shall
be managed, and boundaries will be marked. [Note:
Managed turf (e.g., playgrounds, regularly maintained
open areas) is not an acceptable form of vegetation
management.]
[d] Shall have a minimum contiguous area requirement of
10,000 square feet.
[e] Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
[f] Must be forested or have a stable, natural ground
cover.
(b) Volume Reduction Method #2: stream buffers.
49.Editor's Note: Appendix E is an attachment to this chapter.
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:258
[1] This reduction can be taken when a stream buffer
effectively treats stormwater runoff. Effective treatment
constitutes treating runoff through overland flow in a
naturally vegetated or forested buffer. Under the proposed
method, a designer would be able to subtract areas
draining via overland flow to the buffer from total site area
when computing water quality protection volume
requirements. The design of the stream buffer treatment
system must use appropriate methods for conveying flows
above the annual recurrence (one-year storm) event.
[2] Rule. Subtract areas draining via overland flow to the
buffer from total site area when computing water quality
protection volume requirements.
[3] Criteria.
[a] The minimum undisturbed buffer width shall be 50
feet from top of bank.
[b] The maximum contributing length shall be 150 feet for
pervious surfaces and 75 feet for impervious surfaces.
[c] The average contributing slope shall be 3% maximum,
unless a flow spreader is used. In no case shall the
average contributing slope be greater than 10%.
[d] Runoff shall enter the buffer as overland sheet flow. A
flow spreader can be installed to ensure this.
[e] Buffers shall remain as naturally vegetated or forested
areas and will require only routine debris removal or
erosion repairs.
[f] Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
[g] Not applicable if overland flow filtration/groundwater
recharge reduction is already being taken.
(c) Volume Reduction Method #3: enhanced swales.
[1] This reduction may be taken when enhanced swales are
used for water quality protection. Under the proposed
method, a designer would be able to subtract the areas
draining to an enhanced swale from total site area when
computing water quality protection volume requirements.
An enhanced swale can fully meet the water quality
protection volume requirements for certain kinds of lowdensity
residential development (see Volume Reduction
Method #5). An added benefit is the post-development
peak discharges will likely be lower due to a longer time of
concentration for the site.
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:259
[2] Rule. Subtract the areas draining to an enhanced swale
from total site area when computing water quality
protection volume requirements.
[3] Criteria.
[a] This method is typically only applicable to moderateor
low-density residential land uses (three dwelling
units per acre maximum).
[b] The maximum flow velocity for water quality design
storm shall be less than or equal to one foot per
second.
[c] The minimum residence time for the water quality
storm shall be five minutes.
[d] The bottom width shall be a maximum of six feet. If a
larger channel is needed, use of a compound cross
section is required.
[e] The side slopes shall be 3:1 (horizontal: vertical) or
flatter.
[f] The channel slope shall be 3% or less.
[g] Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
(d) Volume Reduction Method #4: overland flow filtration/
groundwater recharge zones.
[1] This reduction can be taken when overland flow filtration/
infiltration zones are incorporated into the site design to
receive runoff from rooftops or other small impervious
areas (e.g., driveways, small parking lots, etc.). This can be
achieved by grading the site to promote overland
vegetative filtering or by providing infiltration or rain
garden areas. If impervious areas are adequately
disconnected, they can be deducted from total site area
when computing the water quality protection volume
requirements. An added benefit will be that the postdevelopment
peak discharges will likely be lower due to a
longer time of concentration for the site.
[2] Rule. If impervious areas are adequately disconnected,
they can be deducted from total site area when computing
the water quality protection volume requirements.
[3] Criteria.
[a] Relatively permeable soils (hydrologic soil groups A
and B) should be present.
[b] Runoff shall not come from a designated hot spot.
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:260
[c] The maximum contributing impervious flow path
length shall be 75 feet.
[d] Downspouts shall be at least 10 feet away from the
nearest impervious surface to discourage
reconnections.
[e] The disconnection shall drain continuously through a
vegetated channel, swale or filter strip to the property
line or structural stormwater control.
[f] The length of the disconnection shall be equal to or
greater than the contributing length.
[g] The entire vegetative "disconnection" shall be on a
slope less than or equal to 3%.
[h] The surface impervious area tributary to any one
discharge location shall not exceed 5,000 square feet.
[i] For those areas draining directly to a buffer, reduction
can be obtained from either overland flow filtration or
stream buffers. (See Method #2.)
[j] Rv is kept constant when calculating WQv.
(e) Volume Reduction Method #5: environmentally sensitive large
lot subdivisions.
[1] This reduction can be taken when a group of
environmental site design techniques are applied to lowand
very-low-density residential development (e.g., one
dwelling unit per two acres or lower). The use of this
method can eliminate the need for structural stormwater
controls to treat water quality protection volume
requirements. This method is targeted towards large lot
subdivisions and will likely have limited application.
[2] Rule. Targeted towards large lot subdivisions (e.g., twoacre
lots and greater). The requirement for structural
facilities to treat the water quality protection volume may
be waived.
[3] Criteria:
[a] For single lot development.
[i] Total site impervious cover is less than 15%.
[ii] Lot size shall be at least two acres.
[iii] Rooftop runoff is disconnected in accordance with
the criteria in Method #4.
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:261
[iv] Grass channels are used to convey runoff versus
curb and gutter.
[b] For multiple lots:
[i] Total impervious cover footprint shall be less than
15% of the area.
[ii] Lot areas should be at least two acres, unless
clustering is implemented. Open space
developments should have a minimum of 25% of
the site protected as natural conservation areas
and shall be at least 1/2 acre average individual
lot size.
[iii] Grass channels should be used to convey runoff
versus curb and gutter (see Method #3).
[iv] Overland flow filtration/infiltration zones should
be established (see Method #4).
Note: The following sections provide minimum design standards for stormwater management
facilities.
B. Stormwater infiltration practices.
(1) In selecting the appropriate infiltration BMPs, the applicant shall
consider the following:
(a) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(b) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(c) Seasonal high-water table.
(d) Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
(e) Erodibility of soils.
(f) Land availability and topography.
(g) Slope stability.
(h) Effects on nearby properties and structures.
(2) A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of infiltration BMPs. The evaluation shall
be performed by a qualified professional and, at a minimum,
address soil permeability, depth to bedrock and slope stability. The
general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
(a) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the watershed to determine general
areas of suitability for infiltration BMPs.
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:262
(b) Provide field testing data to determine appropriate percolation
rate and/or hydraulic connectivity.
(c) Design infiltration BMPs for required stormwater volume
based on field-determined capacity at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface.
(d) All infiltration calculations for proposed infiltration,
bioretention and rain garden areas should be based on
Appendix C from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection Stormwater Management BMP
Manual, latest edition.
(3) Soil characteristics, as subject to the specific considerations below:
(a) Infiltration BMPs are particularly appropriate in hydrologic soil
groups A and B, as described in the USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Manual TR-55.
(b) Low-erodibility factors ("K" factors) are preferred for the
construction of basins.
(c) There must be a minimum depth of 48 inches between the
bottom of any facility and the seasonal high-water table and/or
bedrock (limiting zones), except for infiltration BMPs receiving
only roof runoff, which shall be placed in soils having a
minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the facility
and the limiting zone.
(d) There must be an infiltration and/or percolation rate enough to
accept the additional stormwater load and to drain completely
as determined by field tests.
(e) The infiltration system shall have positive overflow controls to
prevent storage within one foot of the finished surface or
grade.
(f) Infiltration rates shall not be used in computing the storage
volume of the infiltration system.
(g) Surface inflows shall be designed to prevent direct discharge
of sediment into the infiltration system.
(4) The recharge volume provided at the site shall be directed to the
most permeable hydrologic soil group available, except where
other considerations apply, such as in limestone geology.
(5) Any infiltration BMP shall be capable of completely infiltrating the
impounded water within 48 hours. The forty-eight-hour period is to
be measured from the end of the twenty-four-hour design storm.
(6) The municipality may require additional analyses for stormwater
management facilities proposed for susceptible areas, such as:
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:263
(a) Strip mines.
(b) Storage areas for salt, chloride, other materials for winter
deicing.
(c) Unstable slopes.
(7) During the period of land disturbance, runoff shall be controlled
prior to entering any proposed infiltration area. Areas proposed for
infiltration BMPs shall be protected from sedimentation and
compaction during the construction phase so as to maintain their
maximum infiltration capacity.
(8) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
received final stabilization.
(9) Infiltration facilities shall be selected based on suitability of soils
and site conditions. Acceptable infiltration facilities include, but
are not limited to, filter strips or stormwater filtering systems (for
example bioretention facilities, sand filters), open vegetated
channels (that is, dry swales and wet swales), infiltration trenches,
dry wells, infiltration basins, porous paving systems, retention
basins, wet extended detention ponds, riparian corridor
management, riparian forested buffers, rooftop runoff management
systems, and sand filters (closed or open).
(10) Where sediment transport in the stormwater runoff is anticipated
to reach the infiltration system, appropriate permanent measures
to prevent or collect sediment shall be installed prior to discharge
to the infiltration system.
(11) All infiltration facilities shall be set back at least 15 feet from all
structures with subgrade elements (e.g., basements, foundation
walls).
(12) All infiltration facilities that serve more than one lot and are
considered a common facility shall have a drainage easement. The
easement shall provide to the municipality the right of access.
(13) If detailed infiltration study is required, the following guidance
shall be followed:
(a) Soil evaluations shall be performed to determine the feasibility
and extent to which infiltration systems can be used. The
evaluation shall be performed by a qualified, licensed
geologist, geotechnical/civil engineer or soil scientist and, at a
minimum, address soil types, soil permeability, depth to
bedrock, limitations of soils, presence/absence of carbonate
geology susceptibility to subsidence and/or sinkhole formation
and subgrade stability. The testing and evaluation should be
completed at the preliminary design stage.
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:264
(b) Infiltration requirements shall be based on the portions of the
site that are permeable prior to disturbance and the degree to
which development will reduce the permeability of the site.
Permeability of the site shall be determined based on the
detailed evaluations described herein. Use of stormwater
management facilities to retain stormwater for infiltration
should be applied to all areas where the soils evaluation
indicates favorable conditions. Areas generally not favorable
for infiltration shall still be provided with an appropriate water
quality practice.
(c) Soil infiltration tests shall be performed to an equivalent depth
or elevation of the bottom of the proposed infiltration areas.
These tests shall follow the procedures of percolation test
holes, as established by the Allegheny County Health
Department (ACHD), for on-lot septic systems. The testing
shall include a test pit and percolation test holes. The test hole
shall be excavated to a depth so that the presence or absence
of bedrock and/or seasonal high-water table can be
determined. A soil log describing the soils present in each test
pit shall be performed. All test holes used for evaluating the
percolation rate shall be presoaked in accordance with the
procedures established by the ACHD. The location and number
of test pits and percolation holes shall be determined based on
the type(s) of stormwater management facilities being
designed. Acceptability of infiltration rates shall be based on
sound engineering judgment and recommended design
considerations described in the design manuals listed in the
references or other source material acceptable to the
Municipal Engineer.
(14) The following design and construction standards shall be followed
when planning and constructing infiltration BMPs.
(a) The lowest elevation of the infiltration area shall be at least two
feet above the seasonal high-water table and bedrock.
(b) Where roof drains are designed to discharge to infiltration
facilities, they shall have appropriate measures to prevent
clogging by unwanted debris (for example, silt, leaves and
vegetation). Such measures shall include, but are not limited
to, leaf traps, gutter guards and cleanouts.
(c) All infiltration facilities shall have appropriate positive
overflow controls to prevent storage within one foot of the
finished surface or grade, unless a specific amount of surface
storage away from pedestrian and vehicular traffic is provided
and such areas infiltrate the stored volume within 48 hours
after the end of the twenty-four-hour design storm.
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:265
(d) All infiltration facilities shall be designed to infiltrate the
stored volume within 48 hours after the end of the twenty-fourhour
design storm.
(e) All surface inflows shall be treated to prevent the direct
discharge of sediment into the infiltration practice;
accumulated sediment reduces stormwater storage capacity
and ultimately clogs the infiltration mechanism. No sand, salt
or other particulate matter may be applied to a porous
(pervious) surface for winter ice conditions.
(f) During site construction, all infiltration practice components
shall be protected from compaction due to heavy equipment
operation or storage of fill or construction material. Infiltration
areas shall also be protected from sedimentation. Areas that
are accidentally compacted or graded shall be remediated to
restore soil composition and porosity. Adequate documentation
to this effect shall be submitted for review by the Municipal
Engineer. All areas designated for infiltration shall not receive
runoff until the contributory drainage area has achieved final
stabilization.
(g) The following procedures and materials shall be required
during the construction of all subsurface facilities:
[1] Excavation for the infiltration facility shall be performed
with equipment that will not compact the bottom of the
seepage bed/trench or like facility.
[2] The bottom of the bed and/or trench shall be scarified
prior to the placement of aggregate.
[3] Only clean aggregate with documented porosity, free of
fines, shall be allowed.
[4] The tops and sides of all seepage beds, trenches or like
facilities shall be covered with drainage fabric. Fabric shall
meet the specifications of PennDOT Publication 408,
Section 735, Construction Class 1.
[5] Perforated distribution pipes connected to centralized
catch basins and/or manholes with the provision for the
collection of debris shall be provided in all facilities. Where
perforated pipes are used to distribute stormwater to the
infiltration practice, stormwater shall be distributed
uniformly throughout the entire seepage bed/trench or like
facility.
C. Open vegetated channels.
(1) Open vegetated channels are conveyance systems that are
engineered to also perform as water quality and infiltration
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:266
facilities. Such systems can be used for the conveyance, retention,
infiltration and filtration of stormwater runoff.
(2) Open vegetated channels primarily serve a water quality function
(WQv); they also have the potential to augment infiltration.
Examples of such systems include, but are not limited to, dry
swales, wet swales, grass channels, and biofilters. Open vegetated
channels are primarily applicable for land uses such as roads,
highways, residential developments (dry swales only) and pervious
areas.
(3) Open vegetated channels shall be designed to meet the following
minimum standards:
(a) The channel shall be designed to safely convey the ten-yearfrequency
storm event with a freeboard of at least 12 inches.
Freeboard is the difference between the elevation of the design
flow in the channel and the top elevation of the channel.
(b) The peak velocity of the runoff from the ten-year storm shall be
nonerosive for the soil and ground cover provided in the
channel.
(c) The longitudinal slope shall be no greater than 4%.
(d) Channels shall be trapezoidal in cross section.
(e) Channels shall be designed with moderate side slopes of four
horizontal to one vertical. Flatter side slopes may be necessary
under certain circumstances.
(f) The maximum allowable ponding time in the channel shall be
less than 48 hours.
(g) Channels (for example, dry swales) may require an underdrain
in order to function and dewater.
(h) Channels shall be designed to temporarily store the WQv
within the system for a maximum period of 48 hours and a
minimum period of one hour.
(i) Landscape specifications shall address the grass species,
wetland plantings (if applicable), soil amendment and hydric
conditions present along the channel.
(j) Accumulated sediment within the channel bottom shall be
removed when 25% of the original WQv volume has been
exceeded. The channel shall be provided with a permanent
concrete cleanout marker that indicates the 25% loss level.
(k) Check dams along the channel length may be warranted.
(l) The bottom of dry swales shall be situated at least two feet
above the seasonal high-water table.
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:267
(4) Additional design information for open vegetated channels is
available in Design of Roadside Channels with Flexible Linings,
HEC 15, FHWA, September 2005.
D. Retention basins.
(1) Retention basins shall be designed to create a healthy ecological
community with sufficient circulation of water to prevent the
growth of unwanted vegetation and mosquitoes or other vectors. If
circulation cannot be provided via natural means, then artificial
aeration and circulation shall be provided. Care shall be taken to
landscape retention basins in accordance with § 518-19.
(2) The retention basin shall be of sufficient size to allow the
appropriate aquatic community needed to maintain healthy pond
ecology and avoid mosquitoes capable of carrying West Nile Virus
and other diseases. The Allegheny County Health Department,
Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, the Natural Resources
Conservation Service, the Pennsylvania Extension Service, or other
qualified professional consultant shall be consulted during the
design of these facilities in order to ensure the health of aquatic
communities and minimize the risk of creating mosquito breeding
areas.
(3) An outlet structure shall be designed to allow complete drainage of
the pond for maintenance.
(4) The design of a retention basin shall include the determination of
the proposed site's ability to support a viable permanent pool. The
design shall consider such factors as the available and required
rate and quality of dry weather inflow, the stormwater inflow,
seasonal and longer-term variations in groundwater table, and
impacts of potential pollutant loadings.
(5) Sediment storage volume equal to at least 20% of the volume of the
permanent pool shall be provided.
(6) A sediment forebay with a hardened bottom shall be provided at
each inlet into the retention basin. The forebay storage capacity
shall, at minimum, be 10% of the permanent pool storage. The
forebay shall be designed to allow for access by maintenance
equipment for periodic cleaning. A permanent concrete cleanout
marker shall be installed in the forebay to indicate the level where
25% for the forebay storage has been used.
(7) Emergency spillways shall be sized and located to permit the safe
passage of stormwater flows from an unattenuated 100-year postdevelopment
storm with one foot of freeboard. The maximum
velocities in vegetated spillways excavated in otherwise
undisturbed soil shall be analyzed based upon the velocity of peak
flow in the emergency spillway during an assumed clogged primary
outlet condition. Where maximum velocities exceed design
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:268
standards contained in the Engineering Field Manual for
Conservation Practices (USDA, SCS, July 1984) suitable lining shall
be provided. All emergency spillways placed on fill materials shall
be lined. Lining for emergency spillways shall incorporate native
colors and materials where possible, including mono slab
revetments, grass pavers, riprap and native stone.
(8) Basin and pond embankments must be designed by a professional
engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The
design must include an investigation of the subsurface conditions
at the proposed embankment location to evaluate settlement
potential, groundwater impacts, and the need for seepage controls.
The submittal of a geotechnical report from a geotechnical
engineer for any embankment over 10 feet in effective height or
posing a significant hazard to downstream property or life is
required. The selection of fill materials must be subject to approval
of the design engineer. Fill must be free of frozen soil, rocks over
six inches, sod, brush, stumps, tree roots, wood, or other perishable
materials. Embankment fills less than 10 feet in fill height must be
compacted using compaction methods that would reasonably
guarantee that the fill density is at least 90% of the maximum
density as determined by standard proctor (ASTM-698). All
embankment fills more than 10 feet in fill height must be
compacted to at least 90% of the maximum density as determined
by standard proctor (ASTM-698) and must have their density
verified by field density testing. A PADEP dam permit is required
for embankments having a maximum depth of water, measured
from the upstream toe of the dam to the top of the dam at maximum
storage elevation, of greater than 15 feet; and/or for ponds having
contributory drainage area of greater than 100 acres; and/or for
impoundments of greater than 50 acre-feet.
(9) The embankment's interior slope may not be steeper than 3:1. The
exterior slope of the embankment may not exceed 2:1.
(10) The minimum embankment width shall be four feet for
embankments less than six feet in height, six feet if the
embankment is between 6.1 feet and 9.9 feet in height and eight
feet if the embankment is between 10 feet and 15 feet in height.
(11) Existing ponds or permanent pool basins can be used for
stormwater management if it can be demonstrated that the ponds
are structurally sound and meet the design requirements herein.
(12) Inlet structures and outlet structures shall be separated to the
greatest extent possible in order to maximize the flow path through
the retention basin.
(13) Retention basins shall be designed to provide a length-to-width
ratio of at least 3L:1W, as measured in plan view (for example, a
ratio of 4L:1W is too narrow).
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:269
(14) The retention basin depth shall average three to six feet.
(15) Fencing of the facility is not required if the interior slope of the
pond is 4H:1V or flatter and the design also includes a five-footwide
bench around the pond perimeter at an elevation one foot
below the permanent water surface elevation.
(16) Any side slopes below the permanent water surface level shall not
exceed 3H:1V. Interior side slopes above the permanent water
surface level shall not exceed 3H:1V.
(17) Stabilization. Proper stabilization structures, including stilling
basins, energy dissipators, and channel lining, shall be constructed
at the outlets of all retention basins and emergency spillways. The
stabilization structures shall control water to: avoid erosion,
reduce velocities of released water, and direct water so that it does
not interfere with downstream activities.
(18) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed to
prevent erosion and/or initiate sheet flow at points where pipes or
drainageways discharge to or from basins. Level spreaders shall be
used only where the maximum slope between the discharge point
and the waterway does not exceed 5%. Energy dissipators shall
comply with criteria in Hydraulic Design of Energy Dissipators for
Culverts and Channels, HEC 14, FHWA, July 2006. Such facilities
shall be both functional and harmonious with the surrounding
environment; for example, native rock shall be used in constructing
dissipators where practical.
(19) Discharge points. The minimum distance between a proposed basin
discharge point (including the energy dissipator, etc.) and a
downstream property boundary shall in no case be less than 15
feet. Where there is discharge onto or through adjacent properties
prior to release to a stream, designers shall demonstrate how
downstream properties are to be protected. The Municipal
Engineer may require that the setback distance be increased based
upon factors such as topography, soil conditions, the size of
structures, the location of structures, and discharge rates. A
drainage easement may also be required.
(20) Outlet structures. Outlet structures shall meet the following
specifications:
(a) To minimize clogging and to facilitate cleaning and inspecting,
outlet pipes shall have an internal diameter of at least 15
inches and a minimum grade of 1%.
(b) Bentonite plugs shall be provided on all outlet pipes within a
constructed berm.
(c) All principal outlet structures shall be built using reinforced
concrete with watertight construction joints.
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:270
(d) The use of architecturally treated concrete, stucco, painted
surface or stone facade treatment shall be considered for
enhancing the outlet structure. Such facilities shall be both
functional and harmonious in design with the surrounding
environment.
(e) Outlet pipes shall be constructed of reinforced concrete with
rubber gaskets in conformance with AASHTO M170, M198 and
M207, or smooth interior HDPE pipe in conformance with
AASHTO M252 or M294.
(f) Basin outlet structures shall have childproofed nonclogging
trash racks over all design openings exceeding 12 inches in
diameter except those openings designed to carry perennial
stream flows. Periodic cleaning of debris from trash racks shall
be included in the operations and maintenance plan.
(g) Anti-vortex devices, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to
the basin berm, shall be provided at the top of all circular
risers or standpipes.
E. Detention basins.
(1) The landscape standards of § 518-19 shall apply.
(2) The maximum inside side slopes shall not exceed three horizontal
to one vertical (3H:1V). The minimum required slope for the basin
bottom is 2%. A level bottom is acceptable, provided the designer
demonstrates to the municipality's satisfaction that the basin
bottom will be landscaped with appropriate wetland vegetation
pursuant to § 518-19. In addition, detention basins of sufficient size
and slope may serve other functions as well, including recreational
uses which do not hinder or conflict with the function of the
detention basin.
(3) Inlet structures. The inlet pipe invert into a basin shall be six inches
above the basin floor or lining so that the pipe can adequately drain
after rainstorms. Inlets shall discharge into areas of the basin that
slope toward the outlet structure.
(4) Inlet structures and outlet structures shall be separated to the
greatest extent possible in order to maximize the flow path through
the retention basin.
(5) Low-flow channels. Low-flow channels constructed of concrete or
asphalt are not permitted. Where low-flow channels are necessary,
they shall be composed of a natural or bioengineered material.
Low-flow channels shall be designed to promote water quality and
slow the rate of flow through the basin. Low-flow channels may also
be designed to infiltrate where practical.
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:271
(6) Outlet structures. Outlet structures shall meet the following
specifications:
(a) To minimize clogging and to facilitate cleaning and inspection,
outlet pipes shall have an internal diameter of at least 15
inches and a minimum grade of 1%.
(b) Bentonite plugs shall be provided on all outlet pipes within a
constructed berm.
(c) All principal outlet structures shall be built using reinforced
concrete with watertight construction joints.
(d) The use of architecturally treated concrete, stucco, painted
surface or stone facade treatment shall be considered for
enhancing the outlet structure. Such facilities shall be both
functional and harmonious in design with the surrounding
environment.
(e) Outlet pipes shall be constructed of reinforced concrete with
rubber gaskets in conformance with AASHTO M170, M198 and
M207, or smooth interior HDPE pipe in conformance with
AASHTO M252 or M294.
(f) Energy-dissipation facilities that convert concentrated flow to
uniform shallow sheet flow shall be used where appropriate.
(g) Basin outlet structures shall have childproof nonclogging trash
racks over all design openings exceeding 12 inches in diameter
except those openings designed to carry perennial stream
flows.
(h) Anti-vortex devices, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to
the basin berm, shall be provided at the top of all circular
risers or standpipes.
(i) Detention basins should drain completely within 24 to 72 hours
from the end of the storm event.
(7) Emergency spillways shall be sized and located to permit the safe
passage of stormwater flows from an unattenuated 100-year postdevelopment
storm with one foot of freeboard. The maximum
velocities in vegetated spillways excavated in otherwise
undisturbed soil shall be analyzed based upon the velocity of peak
flow in the emergency spillway during an assumed clogged primary
outlet condition. Where maximum velocities exceed design
standards contained in the Engineering Field Manual for
Conservation Practices (USDA, SCS, July 1984) suitable lining shall
be provided. In general, emergency spillways should not be located
in fill areas; all such facilities placed on fill materials shall be lined.
Lining for emergency spillways shall incorporate native colors and
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:272
materials where possible, including mono-slab revetments, grass
pavers, riprap and native stone.
(8) Basin and pond embankments must be designed by a professional
engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The
design must include an investigation of the subsurface conditions
at the proposed embankment location to evaluate settlement
potential, groundwater impacts, and the need for seepage controls.
The submittal of a geotechnical report from a geotechnical
engineer for any embankment over 10 feet in effective height or
posing a significant hazard to downstream property or life is
required. The selection of fill materials must be subject to approval
of the design engineer. Fill must be free of frozen soil, rocks over
six inches, sod, brush, stumps, tree roots, wood, or other perishable
materials. Embankment fills less than 10 feet in fill height must be
compacted using compaction methods that would reasonably
guarantee that the fill density is at least 90% of the maximum
density as determined by standard proctor (ASTM-698). All
embankment fills more than 10 feet in fill height must be
compacted to at least 90% of the maximum density as determined
by standard proctor (ASTM-698) and must have their density
verified by field density testing. A PADEP dam permit is required
for embankments having a maximum depth of water, measured
from the upstream toe of the dam to the top of the dam at maximum
storage elevation, of greater than 15 feet; and/or for ponds having
contributory drainage area of greater than 100 acres; and/or for
impoundments of greater than 50 acre-feet.
(9) The embankment's interior slope may not be steeper than 3:1. The
exterior slope of the embankment may not exceed 2:1.
(10) The minimum embankment width shall be four feet for
embankments less than six feet in height, six feet if the
embankment is between 6.1 feet and 9.9 feet in height and eight
feet if the embankment is between 10 feet and 15 feet in height.
(11) Fencing of the facility is not required if the interior slope of the
pond is 4:1 or flatter.
(12) Freeboard. Freeboard is the difference between the elevation of
the design flow in the emergency spillway (usually the 100-year
peak elevation) and the top elevation of the settled basin
embankment (that is, top of berm). The minimum freeboard shall
be one foot.
(13) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed to
prevent erosion and/or initiate sheet flow at points where pipes or
drainageways discharge to or from basins. Level spreaders shall be
used only where the maximum slope between the discharge point
and the waterway does not exceed 5%. Energy dissipators shall
comply with criteria in Hydraulic Design of Energy Dissipators for
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:273
Culverts and Channels, HEC 14, FHWA, July 2006. Such facilities
shall be both functional and attractive; for example, native rock
shall be used in constructing dissipators where practical.
(14) Stabilization. Proper stabilization structures, including stilling
basins, energy dissipators and channel lining, shall be constructed
at the outlets of all basins and emergency spillways. The
stabilization structures shall control water to avoid erosion, reduce
velocities of released water and direct water so that it does not
interfere with downstream activities.
(15) Discharge points. The minimum distance between a proposed basin
discharge point (including the energy dissipator, etc.) and a
downstream property boundary shall in no case be less than 15
feet. Where there is discharge onto or through adjacent properties
prior to release to a stream, designers shall demonstrate how
downstream properties are to be protected. The Municipal
Engineer may require that the setback distance be increased based
upon factors such as topography, soil conditions, the size of
structures, the location of structures, and discharge rates. A
drainage easement may also be required.
(16) A sediment forebay with a hardened bottom shall be provided at
each inlet into the detention basin. The forebay storage capacity
shall at minimum be 10% of the permanent pool storage. The
forebay shall be designed to allow for access by maintenance
equipment for periodic cleaning.
F. Conveyance systems (open channels, drainageways and storm sewers).
(1) Applicants are encouraged to design conveyance systems that
encourage infiltration and improve water quality wherever
practicable.
(2) Wherever conveyance channels are necessary, drainage shall be
maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks designed to
carry the ten-year, twenty-four-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas. The Municipal Engineer may
increase the design storm, as conditions require. All open channels
shall be designed with one foot of freeboard above the design water
surface elevation of the design runoff condition.
(3) Flood relief channels shall be provided and designed to convey the
runoff from the 100-year twenty-four-hour storm, such that a
positive discharge of this runoff to an adequate receiving stream or
conveyance system occurs without allowing this runoff to encroach
upon other properties.
(4) Manholes and/or inlets shall not be spaced more than 300 feet
apart for pipe sizes up to 24 inches in diameter and not more than
450 feet apart for larger pipe sizes.
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-18
1:274
(5) Where drainage swales are used in lieu of or in addition to storm
sewers, they shall be designed to carry the required runoff without
erosion and in a manner not detrimental to the properties they
cross. Drainage swales shall provide a minimum grade of 2% but
shall not exceed a grade of 9%. Drainage swales used strictly for
conveyance are not the same as open vegetated channels. Design
standards for open vegetated channels are provided under
§ 518-18C of this chapter.
(6) Street curbing for the purpose of stormwater conveyance is
discouraged. On streets that must contain curbing, storm sewers
shall be placed in front of the curbing. To the greatest extent
possible, storm sewers shall not be placed directly under curbing.
At curbed street intersections, storm inlets shall be placed in the
tangent section of the road.
(7) Use of grassed swales or open vegetated swales in lieu of curbing
to convey, infiltrate and/or treat stormwater runoff from roadways
is encouraged. Inlets shall be placed at the center of the shoulder
swale draining the street and shall be located no closer than four
feet from the edge of the cartway.
(8) When requested by the municipality, the developers shall obtain or
grant a minimum twenty-foot-wide drainage easement over all
storm sewers, drainage swales, channels, etc., that are a
component of the stormwater management system when located
within undedicated land. All permanent detention basins and/or
other stormwater management facilities providing stormwater
control for other than a single residential lot shall be located within
a defined drainage easement that allows proper legal access and
maintenance vehicle access.
(9) No property owner shall obstruct or alter the flow, location or
carrying capacity of a stream, channel or drainage swale to the
detriment of any other property owner, whether upstream or
downstream. All subdivision and/or land development plans
containing streams, channels, drainage swales, storm sewers or
other conveyance systems that cross property boundaries, existing
or proposed, or whose discharge crosses such boundaries shall
contain a note stating the above.
(10)Water quality inlets. Storm drainage systems that collect runoff
from parking areas and/or loading areas exceeding 10,000 square
feet of impervious coverage and discharge to stormwater
management systems, including surface or subsurface infiltration
systems, shall have a minimum of one water quality inlet per each
acre of drainage area. The purpose of water quality inlets is to
remove oil, grease and heavy particulates or total suspended solids,
hydrocarbons and other floating substances from stormwater
runoff. Methods other than water quality inlets may be permitted if
the applicant demonstrates to the municipality's satisfaction that
§ 518-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-18
1:275
§ 518-19. Landscaping of stormwater management facilities.
Stormwater management facilities shall be landscaped in accordance with
the following standards.
Note: Many municipalities require that stormwater management facilities
be landscaped in order to create more natural facilities that blend into
the landscape. Accordingly, such landscaping can contribute to the
effectiveness of the facility to hold and filter water as well. The standards
listed below are an example of the type of landscaping practices that might
be required. Also note that these standards relate specifically to structural
facilities; other types of management strategies, including riparian buffers,
constructed wetlands, etc., may need landscaping and enhancement
standards as well.
any such alternative will be as effective and as easily maintained.
Periodic cleaning of these systems shall be addressed in the
operations and maintenance plan submitted to the municipality.
Note: Municipalities may wish to expand on the types of stormwater practices listed above
(only the general categories of stormwater management practices are covered in this chapter).
For example, it is recommended that sections be added on porous paving, water quality inlets,
bioretention, rain barrels and sand filters, to name a few. On the other hand, the design
and construction of many stormwater management practices evolves over time and some
municipalities may wish to list only the general categories for that purpose (but provide for
other techniques in accordance with new design manuals, etc.). Also, riparian corridors and
other native plant landscaping can provide a valuable stormwater management benefit and
should be addressed but may best be implemented through a separate ordinance.
A. Landscaping shall be required in and around all constructed
stormwater management facilities with a minimum surface area of
1,000 square feet for the purposes of:
(1) Assisting in the management of stormwater;
(2) Stabilizing the soil within such facilities to minimize and control
erosion;
(3) Enhancing the visual appearance of such facilities; and
(4) Mitigating maintenance problems commonly associated with the
creation of such facilities.
B. A planting plan and planting schedule shall be submitted in accordance
with the following:
(1) Wet meadows including floors of stormwater management
facilities.
(a) Wet meadows and floors of stormwater management facilities
shall be planted with noninvasive plants native to western
Pennsylvania, such as wildflowers and noninvasive grasses, the
§ 518-18 ETNA CODE § 518-19
1:276
intent being to create a mixed meadow of such plantings where
appropriate. Selection of plantings shall be based on whether
the area in question is usually well drained or permanently
wet and whether the area will be used for recreation purposes.
No woody plants shall be planted within the saturated zone
(phreatic line) of a stormwater management practice or on a
berm constructed for impounded water.
(b) Seeding by drills, corrugated rollers, cyclone or drop seeders
or hand seeding of such areas is preferred; however,
hydroseeding followed by hydromulching can be used on wet
ground and steep slopes.
(c) Fertilizers, as a nutrient supplement, shall not be used unless it
is documented that soil conditions warrant such use and
nutrient applied does not exceed plant uptake. Soil for planting
of wildflowers shall contain not less than 3% or more than 10%
organic matter, as determined by an agricultural chemist, with
certification of the test before planting.
(d) Seeding shall take place either between April 1 and May 15 or
between September 1 and October 15. Planting areas shall be
soaked to maintain a consistent level of moisture for at least
four to six weeks after planting. For seeding recommendations,
reference the DEP's E&S Pollution Control Program Manual.
(e) Once established, a single annual mowing when plants are
dormant should be sufficient to maintain a wet meadow and/or
floor of a stormwater management practice.
(2) Wet edges that remain wet all or most of the year shall be planted
with wildflowers, grasses and shrubs. Plants to be located on rims
or banks which remain dry most of the year shall be planted with
species tolerant of dry soil conditions.
(3) Wooded areas.
(a) Where stormwater management facilities adjoin wooded areas,
trees and shrubs shall be selected and planted outside the
practice so as to blend with existing surroundings.
(b) Plantings in such areas shall be of sufficient density to
eliminate the need for mowing.
(c) It is recommended that clusters of trees and shrubs be planted
around stormwater management facilities but well away from
outfalls and any constructed berms, where applicable, to
provide for wildlife habitat, wind control and buffering and
screening.
(d) Vegetation shall be planted during appropriate times of the
year, predominantly between late March and mid May or from
§ 518-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-19
1:277
§ 518-20. Stream buffer requirements.
early October until evidence of ground freezing, depending
upon the species selected. Most deciduous trees and shrubs
can be planted in either spring or fall. Evergreens are best
planted in late summer or early fall.
(4) Slopes.
(a) Where slopes are gentle, a mixture of meadow grasses and
wildflowers (for wet meadows) shall be planted.
(b) On steep slopes as defined by the municipality's code of
ordinances, dense spreading shrubs (shrubs tolerant of dry
soils) shall be planted. Heavy mat mulch shall be used during
the period of establishment.
(c) No woody plant materials or trees shall be located on a
constructed or natural berm acting as the impoundment
structure of a stormwater management practice. Trees shall be
located downstream of an impoundment berm a sufficient
distance from the toe of the constructed slope to assure that
the toe of the slope is outside the dripline of the species
planted at maturity but in no case less than 15 feet.
(5) In cases where stormwater management facilities are to be located
in proximity to wetlands or waterways, the applicant's planting
plan and schedule shall consider the sensitive conditions existing
therein and be modified accordingly to reflect existing flora.
(6) Stormwater management facilities shall be screened in a manner
which complements the existing landscape and provides sufficient
access for maintenance.
A. Stream buffers shall be provided for new development sites as per the
following requirements:
(1) A minimum stream buffer width of 50 feet landward in each
direction from the top of stream banks is required for all waterways
having both a defined bank and a contributing watershed area of
greater than 100 acres.
B. The stream buffer area should be maintained in a natural state.
C. When wetland(s) extend beyond the edge of the required buffer width,
the buffer shall be adjusted so that the buffer consists of the extent of
the wetland plus a twenty-five-foot zone extending beyond the wetland
edge.
D. Stream buffer averaging may be applied to account for encroachments
such as road crossings. The following criteria must be met in order to
utilize buffer averaging on a development site:
§ 518-19 ETNA CODE § 518-20
1:278
§ 518-21. Volume controls.
The green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided
in the BMP Manual, found in § 518-36, shall be utilized for all regulated
activities wherever possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented
using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in
Subsection B below, or alternative design criteria as allowed by Title 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 102.
(1) Buffer averaging is required for water quality buffers that have
stream crossings.
(2) An overall average buffer width of at least 50 feet must be achieved
within the boundaries of the property to be developed. Stream
buffer corridors on adjoining properties cannot be included with
buffer averaging on a separate property, even if owned by the same
property owner.
(3) The average width must be calculated based upon the entire length
of stream bank that is located within the boundaries of the property
to be developed. When calculating the buffer length, the natural
stream channel should be followed.
(4) Stream buffer averaging shall be applied to each side of a stream
independently. If the property being developed encompasses both
sides of a stream, buffer averaging can be applied to both sides of
the stream but must be applied to both sides of the stream
independently.
(5) On each stream bank, the total width of the buffer shall not be less
than 25 feet at any location, except at approved stream crossings.
Those areas of the buffer having a minimum width of 25 feet (or
less at approved stream crossings) can comprise no more than 50%
of the buffer length.
E. Stream buffer locations and widths should be illustrated on all
subdivision plans with notations requiring that they be maintained in a
natural state.
F. Stream buffers should be illustrated on all grading and erosion and
sedimentation control plans. The defined stream buffer location should
be properly recorded. The recording should provide a plan illustrating
the stream buffer location, width and the requirement that it be
maintained in a natural state.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual found in § 518-36)
is applicable as a method to any size of regulated activity. This method
requires detailed modeling based on site conditions. The following shall
be incorporated into the CG-1 method:
§ 518-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-21
1:279
§ 518-22. Rate controls.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour duration
precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition; 20% of existing
impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow in
good condition in the model for existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual found in § 518-36)
provided below is independent of site conditions and should be used if
the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable
to regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that require
design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff
flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 518-22, Rate
controls.
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storm
events. This is the equivalent to a 100% release rate area when
compared to those rates shown in the maps contained in Appendix
A (New and Existing Release Rate Management Districts).50 This
predevelopment to post-development control is not to be
misconstrued as the same as the conditional direct discharge areas
on the release rate maps. If it is shown that the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less than
or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
50.Editor's Note: Appendix A is an attachment to this chapter.

§ 518-23. Riparian buffers.
predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-,
fifty- and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storms, then the
requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the
applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy
the peak rate of discharge requirement.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:
(1) For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundredyear
twenty-four-hour storm events, the post-development peak
discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate
maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A (New and Existing
Release Rate Management Districts) of this ordinance. For any
areas not shown on the release rate maps, the post-development
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge
rates for the specified design events. Peak flows should be
computed using the methods included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP
Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian buffer.
B. Except as required by Title 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102, the Riparian
Buffer Easement shall be required for all streams (as defined in Article
V, Definitions) with a contributing watershed area of greater than 10
acres. The riparian buffer easement shall be measured to be a minimum
of 35 feet from the top of the stream bank (on each side.)
C. Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
(1) Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
(2) Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed, and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
D. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds
Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the
property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued
private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area
required by zoning, unless otherwise specified in Chapter 615, Zoning,
of this Code.
§ 518-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 518-23
1:281
§ 518-24. Authorization to construct; term of validity.
The municipality's approval of an SWM site plan authorizes the regulated
activities contained in the SWM site plan for a maximum term of validity
of five years following the date of approval. The municipality may specify a
term of validity shorter than five years in the approval for any specific SWM
site plan. Terms of validity shall commence on the date the municipality
signs the approval for an SWM site plan. If an approved SWM site plan is
not completed according to § 518-34 within the term of validity, then the
municipality may consider the SWM site plan disapproved and may revoke
any and all permits. SWM site plans that are considered disapproved by
the municipality shall be resubmitted in accordance with § 518-32 of this
chapter.
E. Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing
100-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and

ARTICLE II
Backflow and Cross-Connections
[Adopted 6-15-1993 by Ord. No. 1227]
§ 587-4. General policy.
§ 587-5. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AIR GAP SEPARATION  The unobstructed vertical distance through the
free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying potable water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the
flood level rim of the receptacle. The differential distance shall be at least
double the diameter (2 x D) of the supply pipe measured vertically above
the top of the rim of the vessel. In no case shall the air gap be less than one
inch.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is:
(1) To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system
contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through the
service connection into the public water supply system.
(2) To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable water
system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and
sources or systems containing process fluids.
(3) To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection
control which will systematically and effectively
prevent the contamination or pollution of the public's and
consumer's potable water system.
B. Application. This article shall apply to all premises served by the public
water supply system of the Borough of Etna.
C. Policy. The public water supplier and the consumer have the joint
responsibility for protection of the public water supply system from
contamination due to backflow of contaminants through the water
service connection. If in the judgment of the public water supplier or his
authorized representative an approved backflow prevention device is
required, the supplier shall give notice to the consumer to install such
approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to his
premises. The consumer shall immediately install such approved device
or devices at his own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the
part of the consumer to install such device or devices shall constitute
grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such
device or devices have been installed.
§ 587-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 587-5
1:423
APPROVED  Means a backflow prevention device or method has been
accepted by the public water supplier as suitable for the proposed use.
ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER  (Also known as the non-pressuretype
vacuum breaker.) A device containing a shutoff valve followed by a
valve body containing a float-check, a check seat and an air inlet port. When
the shutoff valve is open, the flow of water causes the float to close the air
inlet port. When the shutoff valve is closed, the float falls and forms a check
valve against backsiphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port.
AUXILIARY WATER SYSTEM  Any water source or system on the premises
of or available to the customer, except connections to other approved
community water supply systems.
BACKFLOW  A flow condition, induced by a differential in pressure, that
causes the flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases
or other substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply
system from a source other than its intended source.
BACKFLOW PREVENTER  A device or other means which will prevent the
backflow of water or liquids of questionable quality into the public water
supply system.
BACKSIPHONAGE  The backflow of water or mixture of water and other
liquids, gases or other substances from a plumbing fixture or other
customer source into a public water supply system main due to a temporary
negative or subatmospheric pressure within the public water supply system.
CONSUMER  The owner or person in control of any premises supplied by
or in any manner connected to a public water supply system.
CONSUMER'S WATER SYSTEM  Any water system located on the
consumer's premises supplied by or in any manner connected to a public
water supply system. A household plumbing system is considered to be a
consumer's water system.
CONTAINMENT  Cross-connection control which isolates the customer's
entire facility from the public water supply system so as to provide the
protection necessary to prevent contamination of the public water supply in
the event of backflow from the customer's facility.
CONTAMINATION  The degradation of the quality of the drinking water
by wastewaters, processed fluids, or any water of a quality less than
accepted drinking water quality to a degree which would create an actual
hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of
disease.
CROSS-CONNECTION  An arrangement allowing either a direct or
indirect connection through which backflow, including backsiphonage, can
occur between the drinking water in a public water system and a system
containing a source or potential source of contamination.
DEGREE OF HAZARD  An evaluation of the potential risk to health and
the adverse effect upon the public water supply system.
§ 587-5 ETNA CODE § 587-5
1:424
DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY  An assembly composed of two
single, independently acting, check valves, including tightly closing shutoff
valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for
testing the water tightness of each check valve.
HEALTH HAZARD  Any condition, device or practice in a water system or
its operation that creates or may create a danger to the health and wellbeing
of its users. The word "severe," as used to qualify "health hazard,"
means a hazard to the health of the user that could reasonably be expected
to result in the significant morbidity or death.
INTERCHANGEABLE CONNECTION  An arrangement or device that will
allow alternate but not simultaneous use of two sources of water.
NONPOTABLE WATER  Water not safe for drinking, personal or culinary
use.
PERSON  Any individual, partnership, association, company, corporation,
municipality, municipal authority, political subdivision or any agency of
federal or state government. The term includes the officers, employees and
agents of any partnership, association, company, corporation, municipality,
municipal authority, political subdivision or any agency of federal or state
government.
POLLUTION  The presence in water of any foreign substance that tends
to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness
or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard
to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such
waters for domestic use.
POTABLE WATER  Water which is satisfactory for drinking, culinary and
domestic purposes and meets the requirements of the Department of
Environmental Protection.
PROCESS FLUIDS  Any fluid or solution which may be chemically,
biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or
concentration, such as would constitute a health, pollutional or system
hazard if introduced into the public or a consumer's water system. This
includes but is not limited to:
A. Polluted or contaminated waters;

PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM  A system which provides water to the
public for human consumption which has at least 15 service connections or
regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 days
out of the year. The term is either a community or noncommunity water
system and includes any collection, treatment, storage and distribution
facilities under control of the operator of the system and used in connection
with the system. The term includes collection or pretreatment storage
facilities not under such control which are used in connection with the
system. The term also includes a system which provides water for bottling
or bulk hauling for human consumption.
REDUCED PRESSURE ZONE (RPZ) DEVICE  A minimum of two
independently acting check valves, together with an automatically operated
pressure differential relief valve located between the two check valves.
During normal flow and at the cessation of normal flow, the pressure
between these two checks shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of
leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve, by discharging to
the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks
at less than the supply pressure. The unit must include tightly closing
shutoff valves located at each end of the device, and each device shall be
fitted with properly located test cocks.
SERVICE CONNECTION  The terminal end of a service line from the
public water supply system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service,
then the service connection means the downstream end of the meter.

The Borough of Etna finds that:
§ 601-2. Purpose.
The Borough of Etna desires to protect the public health, safety and welfare
through the preservation of the Borough's major groundwater resources
to ensure a future supply of safe, plentiful and healthful drinking water
for the Borough, as well as neighboring municipalities, local residents and
employees, and the general public. The designation of wellhead protection
areas and careful regulation of activities within these areas can reduce the
potential for groundwater contamination.
§ 601-3. Applicability.
A. The groundwater underlying the Borough is a major source of its
existing and future water supply, including drinking water.
B. The groundwater aquifers are integrally connected with, are recharged
by, and flow into the surface waters, lakes and streams, which
constitute a major source of drinking water for the region.
C. Accidental spills and discharges of toxic hazardous materials may
threaten the quality of such groundwater supplies and related water
resources in the Borough, posing potential public health and safety
hazards.
D. Unless preventative measures are adopted to control the discharge and
storage of toxic and hazardous materials within the Borough, spills and
discharges of such materials will predictably occur and with greater
frequency and degree of hazard by reason of increasing construction,
commercial and industrial development, population and vehicular
traffic in the Borough.
A. This chapter shall apply to those areas of the Borough which are
located within wellhead protection areas surrounding a protected
public water supply well as delineated on an official map available for
inspection at the Borough office. A map of the wellhead protection
areas is included in Appendix A for general reference.86 The chapter
shall not apply to any activities of the Borough of Etna or its agents,
servants or employees in performance of their governmental functions.
B. This chapter regulates the following land uses, physical facilities and
activities, which have the potential to deplete or contaminate
groundwater:
86.Editor's Note: The Wellhead Protection Area Map is on file in the Borough office.
§ 601-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 601-3
1:441
§ 601-4. Repealer.
Any ordinance of the Borough inconsistent with any of the provisions of this
chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 601-5. Severability.
Should any section or provision of this chapter be declared invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 601-6. Compatibility with other ordinance requirements.
Approvals issued pursuant to this chapter do not relieve the applicant of
the responsibility to secure the required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by other applicable code, rule or ordinance.

Form and Function
§ 615-10. Zoning Map.
A. The Zoning Map is composed of a series of zoning districts. The
boundaries between zoning districts are, unless otherwise indicated,
either the center lines of streets, alleys, rights-of-way, lot lines,
railroads, rivers or such lines extended.
B. The water surface and the land under the water surface of all
waterways not otherwise zoned are placed in the same zoning district
as the land which it abuts as shown on the Zoning Map. Where the
zoning districts shown on the Zoning Map are different on opposite
sides of the water area, then the zoning district on each side extends to
the center line or midpoint of the water area.
C. Where zoning district boundaries are not clearly fixed by the above
methods, they will be determined by the use of the scale of the Zoning
Map.
D. Where a street or alley shown on the Zoning Map is officially vacated by
replatting or otherwise, the land formerly in such street or alley rightof-
way is included within the zoning district of adjoining lot(s) on either
side of the vacated street or alley. Where the street or alley was a
district boundary between two or more different zoning districts, the
district boundary is the former center line of the vacated street or alley.
E. When there is disagreement on the location of zoning district
boundaries, the Zoning Hearing Board will decide, as the Board has the
power and duty of interpreting the intent of the Zoning Map in
accordance with the spirit and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance of Etna
Borough.
F. Records of all Zoning Map amendments are located on file in Etna
Borough's Municipal Building Administrative Office.
G. Etna Borough is divided into zoning districts as shown on the Zoning
Map of Etna Borough, which is referred to as the "Official Zoning Map,"
together with all explanations on it, and is adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
H. The Zoning Map of Etna Borough is identified by the signature of the
President of the Borough Council, attested by the Borough Manager/
Borough Secretary and bears the seal of Etna Borough under the
following words: "This is to certify that this is the Zoning Map of Etna
Borough, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania," together with the date of
adoption of this chapter.
I. No changes of any nature are made in the Official Zoning Map except in
conformity with the procedures set forth in this chapter. Any
unauthorized change will be considered a violation of this chapter.
§ 615-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 615-10
1:469
§ 615-11. Zoning districts and land uses.
J. The Official Zoning Map, located in Etna Borough's Municipal Building
Administrative Office, is the final authority as to the current zoning
status in Etna Borough.91
K. Any amendments, legally adopted to change any zoning district
boundaries of the Zoning Map, are to be noted on the Map by ordinance
number and date of adoption of the amendment.
L. Borough Council may by ordinance update the parcel lines as available
from Allegheny County on the Zoning Map, noting the applicable date
and source on the Map.
A. Table 1 identifies which land uses are permissible in each of the
Borough's zoning districts. After locating the zoning district in which
the lot is located, use the listing of uses described in the table below to
determine what uses are permissible by right, by conditional use and as
a use by special exception. If no letter denotation exists, the use is not
permissible in that zoning district. In accordance with Article VIII-A of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), the Borough
shares some land uses with Millvale and Sharpsburg Boroughs. See the
Zoning Ordinances of Millvale Borough and/or Sharpsburg Borough for
any land use and corresponding definition that is not noted as
permissible in any zoning district of Etna Borough.

reasonable conditions and safeguards in addition to those expressed in
this chapter as it may seem necessary to implement the purposes of the
MPC and this chapter.
A. The proposed use complies with all applicable provisions and
requirements for that type of use contained in this chapter, unless a
variance to any provision has been granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board, and with other applicable Borough, county and commonwealth
§ 615-14 ETNA CODE § 615-17
1:486
§ 615-18. Standards for specific uses.
In addition to the general standards and criteria for conditional uses listed
in the sections above, an application for any of the following uses which
are listed in any zoning district as a conditional use shall comply with the
following applicable standards and criteria.
and federal ordinances, laws and regulations. The proposed use shall
obtain applicable permits, licenses and approvals from the Borough,
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and federal agencies before final
approval of the conditional use application shall be granted.
B. The proposed use is compatible with the surrounding land uses. It does
not have a negative impact on the existing neighborhood or
development in terms of air and water quality, noise, illumination and
glare, restrictions to natural light and air circulation or other hazardous
conditions that could endanger surrounding residents or impair the use
of surrounding properties.
C. The proposed site for the conditional use is suitable in terms of
topography and soil conditions and size, based on number of projected
users and the frequency of use of the proposed use.
D. The proposed use and site provides for safe, adequate vehicular and
pedestrian access. It has access from a street capable of handling the
traffic generated by the proposed use, and it will not result in undue
traffic congestion and hazardous conditions on adjacent streets. The
use provides for safe, efficient internal circulation and sufficient offstreet
parking and loading.
E. The proposed use complies with all applicable standards and
requirements for providing sanitary sewage disposal, water supply,
storm drainage, solid and toxic waste storage and disposal.
F. The proposed use provides screening or buffer areas as required by this
chapter.
G. The proposed use/development conforms to the scale, character and
exterior appearance of existing structures and uses in the
neighborhood in which it is located.

adverse conditions to the public road right-of-way, a traffic impact
study, in accordance with Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) standards, shall be required to be submitted as part of any
proposed development to determine peak-hour volumes and the
traffic movements produced by such development. A description of
future levels of service and their compliance with standards for
traffic capacity of streets, intersections and driveways shall be
provided. New streets shall be designed for adequate traffic
capacity. All reference to levels of service (LOS) shall be defined by
the Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation
Research Board. These standards may be waived by the Borough if
sufficient evidence is provided that the criteria cannot be met with
reasonable mitigation.

(3) The means of a building's ingress and egress shall meet
requirements as outlined in the Borough's Building Code.
(4) A twelve-foot-wide fire/emergency access route shall be provided
around the perimeter of each building. Topography or other
characteristics of the site or the development that might affect the
use of emergency equipment between buildings may dictate a
greater separation of structures.
(5) The maximum number of units per building shall not exceed 36.
(6) The primary vehicular entrance to a hi-rise residential development
shall, at a minimum, have direct access to a collector road.
(7) Maximum height of lighting for outdoor parking areas and

quantity and type of plants specified by the Borough Planning
Commission.
(10) Slopes shall be graded at a maximum of a three-foot horizontal to
one-foot vertical (3:1) ratio.
(11) If the parking area for a hi-rise residential development is adjacent
to a single-family residential lot and demands greater than 10
automobiles, the following shall apply:
(a) An additional ten-foot buffer yard with one of the following
shall be provided along the parking lot's perimeter to minimize
the impact of inappropriate noise, dust, light and other
disturbances on adjacent residential lots.
[1] One-and-one-half times the required number of plants for
screening and buffering off-street parking and loading
areas; or
[2] A mound, a minimum of 3.5 feet in height at its peak, shall
be constructed whereas the sides do not exceed a four-foot
horizontal to one-foot vertical change in elevation. The
mound shall be landscaped in its entirety with plants that
provide four seasons of interest but shall not include turf
grass. The landowner and/or developer shall coordinate
site drainage so that site development and grading do not
create any adverse effects on adjacent lots.

ARTICLE V
Performance Standards and Supplementary Regulations
§ 615-20. Performance standards.
A. Compliance required.
(1) All uses must comply with the requirements of this chapter, and the
landowner and/or developer must demonstrate that a proposed use
can comply with the standards below prior to Etna Borough issuing
approval and operation commencing on the lot. Compliance must
be determined by the Zoning Officer with respect to permitted
uses, by the Zoning Hearing Board with respect to special
exceptions, and by the Borough Council with respect to conditional
uses.
In order to determine whether a proposed use will conform to the
requirements of this article, Etna Borough may obtain a qualified
consultant's report, whose cost for services will be borne by the
applicant.
(2) All uses that require new facilities or expansion of existing
facilities, such as sewers, storm drains, fire hydrants, potable
water, public streets, street lighting and similar services, will
obtain such approval as required by the agency providing such
service prior to project approval. No availability of essential
services is permitted to be grounds for denying permits for
additional development until such services are available. Etna
Borough is not obligated to extend or supply essential services if
capacity is not available. If capacity is available, the extension of
services will be by and at the cost of the landowner and/or
developer, unless Etna Borough agrees otherwise.
All service extensions are to be designed and installed in full
conformance with Etna Borough's standards for such service, and
be subject to review, permit and inspection as required by other
policies or ordinances of Etna Borough.
B. Fire protection. Fire-protection and firefighting equipment, procedures
and safety protocols acceptable to the National Fire Protection
Association must be readily available and followed where there is any
activity involving the handling or storage of flammable or explosive
material. All other portions of the Borough Code relevant to fire
protection shall also be applicable.
C. Radioactivity; electrical disturbances. Unless otherwise permitted by
Etna Borough for medical purposes, no activity can emit radioactivity at
any point or cause electrical disturbance adversely affecting the
operation of radio or other equipment in the vicinity.
D. Noise. The sound level of any use within this district may not exceed, at
any point along the boundary of the lot on which the use is to be
§ 615-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 615-20
1:507
§ 615-21. Supplementary regulations.
undertaken, federal standards or recommended decibel levels in the
designated octave bands, except for emergency alarm systems. Sound
levels can be projected in accordance with similar or identical
operations or uses and be measured with a sound level meter and
associated octave band analyzer manufactured according to standards
prescribed by the American Standards Association. Measurements
must be made using the same measuring system which may now or
hereafter be utilized by the United States Government for this purpose.
E. Vibrations. Except temporary vibration resulting from construction
activity, vibrations detectable without instruments on any adjacent lot
in any zone will be prohibited.
F. Dust, fumes, vapor and gas control. The emission of dust, dirt, flash,
fumes, vapors or gases which cause any damage to human health,
animals, vegetation or other forms of property, or which can cause
soiling or staining of persons or property at any point beyond the lot
line of the use creating such emission is hereby prohibited. No emission
of liquid or solid particulate from any chimney or stack or otherwise can
exceed 0.03 grains per cubic foot of the covering gas at any point
beyond the lot line of the use creating the emission. Identical processes
or facilities may be compared to determine compliance with this
subsection. For measurement for the amount of particles discharged as
stated above, measurement procedures will follow those employed by
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for similar or
identical measurements.
A. Drainage facilities and floodplains. The provisions of Chapter 518 of
this Code (Borough Ordinance 1378), related to stormwater, and
Chapter 300 of this Code (Borough Ordinance 1353), related to
floodplains, are applicable to matters of zoning within the Borough.
B. Solar collectors and solar-related equipment.

N. Wireless communications facilities.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to establish uniform
standards for the siting, design, permitting, maintenance, and use
of wireless communications facilities in Etna Borough. While the
Borough recognizes the importance of wireless communications
facilities in providing high quality communications service to its
residents and businesses, the Borough also recognizes that it has
an obligation to protect public safety and to minimize the adverse
visual effects of such facilities through the standards set forth in
the following provisions. The final authority on the regulation of
wireless communication facilities are under the jurisdiction of the
Federal Telecommunications Act and related regulations adopted
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Zoning regulations on this
use are permitted to protect the public, health, safety and welfare,
unless specifically excluded by federal and state acts. By enacting
this chapter, the Borough intends to:
(a) Provide for the managed development of wireless
communications facilities in a manner that enhances the
benefits of wireless communication and accommodates the
§ 615-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 615-21

needs of both Borough residents and wireless carriers in
accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.
(b) Establish procedures for the design, siting, construction,
installation, maintenance and removal of both tower-based and
non-tower-based wireless communications facilities in the
Borough, including facilities both inside and outside the public
rights-of-way.
(c) Address new wireless technologies, including but not limited
to, distributed antenna systems, data collection units, cable wifi
and other wireless communications facilities.
(d) Encourage applicant to seek joint use of existing wireless
communications facilities and other tall structures.
(e) Minimize the adverse visual effects and the number of such
facilities through proper design, siting, screening, material,
color and finish, and by requiring that competing providers of
wireless communications services co-locate their commercial
communications antennas and related facilities on existing
towers.
(f) Promote the health, safety and welfare of the Borough's
residents.

antenna and related equipment planned for the proposed
tower-based WCF cannot be accommodated on an existing or
approved structure or building or on Borough property.
Council may deny an application to construct a new towerbased
WCF if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to
mount the antenna(s) on an existing structure as set forth in
this section. The applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted
the owners of tall structures, buildings and towers within a 1/4
of a mile radius of the site proposed, sought permission to
install an antenna on those structures, buildings and towers,
and was denied for one of the following reasons:
[1] The proposed antenna and related equipment would
exceed the structural capacity of the existing building,
structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be
accomplished at a reasonable cost.
[2] The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing
equipment for that existing building, structure or tower,
and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
[3] Such existing buildings, structures or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access or height to
accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to
perform its intended function.
§ 615-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 615-21
1:533

on, attached to, or supported by a tree, stone, cliff or other
natural object.
[2] It is on a public lot or public right-of-way, unless erected by
a governmental body or unless required and/or approved
to be so located by order of a governmental body.
[3] It is displayed on a vehicle parked and visible from a public
right-of-way unless the vehicle is used for the normal dayto-
day operation of a business on the premises. The intent

1:556
of this provision is to prohibit the use of a sign on a vehicle
to circumvent sign limits on the lot.
(b) Sign fonts and logos shall not be legible from the rear of the
sign.
(c) Building signs in nonresidential zoning districts shall be placed
on the front face of the building only, except in instances where
the entrance door to the business is on the side or the rear of

(d) Sign location. Except for permitted billboards or off-premises
signs in conformance with this chapter, all signs shall be
located on the premises which they are intended to serve.

for each square foot of sign area (both faces).
[2] Landscaping shall consist of a combination of deciduous
and evergreen trees, ornamental grasses, ground cover
and/or small shrubs.
[3] Turf grass shall not be considered as landscaping for
ground signs. The height of any decorative base or

provided the grade level is not deliberately elevated to
increase the height of the sign.
(4) Sign size.
(a) The square footage of the sign shall refer to the graphics area
of the sign facing.
(b) Size of individually mounted letters or logos shall be measured
as the area enclosed by the smallest single rectangle or square

against a wall or fence incorporated in the landscaping of a
building shall be measured from the outermost length and
height dimensions of the sign.
(d) Ground signs installed perpendicular to a street may be double
faced with the allowable square footage on each face.
(e) Double-faced signs that are erected at an angle to each other
will be subject to the following as to whether they are intended
§ 615-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 615-23
1:557
as two signs or for all intents and purposes only constitute one
sign:
[1] For north/south, east/west orientation on the serving
street. If the interior angle formed by the two faces of the
double-faced sign is greater than 45°, then both sides of
such sign shall be considered in calculating the sign area.
(f) Wall signs shall not exceed the width of the front of the
building on which they are located and shall not protrude more
than 18 inches from the facade on which the sign is mounted.

not to exceed 12 feet in height and 10 square feet in area, or
the 10 additional square feet can be incorporated into the
existing sign to advertise used cars, divided as the sign owner
selects.
(i) Sign copy mounted or painted on an illuminated surface
(including awnings) or illuminated architectural element of a
building shall be measured as the entire illuminated surface or
architectural element which contains sign copy. A
nonilluminated sign placed on an awning shall be measured as
if it is placed on any other architectural element.
(5) Sign maintenance.
(a) Every permitted sign must be constructed of durable material,
kept in good condition and repair and otherwise comply with
the Borough Building Code and Property Maintenance Code. If
the durability and/or condition of said sign is not repaired or
improved within the time specified by the Zoning Officer, the
Borough may remove the sign at the expense of the owner or
person in possession of the lot on which the sign is located. The
Zoning Officer will notify the property owner and/or the
responsible party with a certified letter prior to any removal
action being taken by the Borough, unless the said sign poses
an imminent danger to persons or property.
(b) Any damaged sign shall be repaired within 60 days, unless
ordered by the Zoning Officer to be repaired or replaced and/or
an imminent danger exists.
(c) Any sign which has been damaged to such extent or installed in
a dangerous manner that it may pose an imminent danger to
the public, as determined by the Zoning Officer, shall be
§ 615-23 ETNA CODE § 615-23
1:558
repaired or removed immediately by the property owner and/
or other known responsible parties.
(d) Any internally illuminated sign cabinets or sign panels which
have been damaged shall remain nonilluminated until
repaired.

relieving or limiting in any way the responsibility or liability of
any person, firm or corporation erecting or owning any sign, or
resulting from the negligence or willful acts of such person,
firm or corporation or any agents, employees or workmen in
the construction, maintenance, repair or removal of any sign
erected in accordance with a zoning permit issued hereunder.
Nor shall issuance of such permit be construed as imposing on
the Borough or its offices or employees, any responsibility or
liability by reason of approval of any sign's structural integrity,
construction methods, materials, electrical or mechanical
devices or other components which shall be the sole
responsibility of the person, firm or corporation erecting,

ARTICLE VII
Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 615-24. Non-conformities.
The provisions of this article apply to buildings, structures, signs, lands
and uses which would not be permitted as the result of the application
of this chapter to their location or use in the Borough, or as a result
of the reclassification of the lot containing them, or of the adoption of
other amendments to this chapter after the initial passage. This article is
concerned with properties of inadequate area and/or frontage, uses of land
and/or structures for activities not permitted in the zone and structures
placed on a lot too close to lot boundary lines for compliance with standards
of the zone in which they are located.
A. Nonconforming lots of record.
(1) Existing lots of record. Any lot of record existing at the effective
date of this chapter and held in separate ownership different from
the ownership of adjoining lots may be used for the erection of a
structure conforming to the use regulations of the zone in which it
is located even though its dimensions are less than the minimum
requirements of this chapter. Where two or more adjacent lots of
record with less than the required area and width are held by one
owner on or before the date of enactment of this chapter, the
request for a permit will be referred to the Zoning Hearing Board,
which may require replatting to fewer lots which would comply
with the minimum requirements of this chapter.
(2) No provision of this chapter relating to side and rear yard
requirements will prevent the reasonable use of a nonconforming
lot of record. The Zoning Officer may grant a reduction in the
requirement for side yards and rear yards for lots of record which
lack required lot width or depth. However, such yard dimensions
may not be reduced by more than 40% of that required without the
approval of the Zoning Hearing Board.
B. Nonconforming uses of land and structures.
(1) Where at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, lawful use of land or land and the structure or structures
on it exists and is made no longer permissible under the
requirements of this chapter, as adopted or amended, such use may
be continued indefinitely so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided the following conditions are applied:
(a) No nonconforming use of land can be extended by acquisition
of additional land to occupy a greater land area than was
occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter.
§ 615-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 615-24
1:573
(b) No structure containing a nonconforming use but capable of
being enlarged without violating setback or height
requirements in the zone where it is located may be increased
in volume more than 50% over the volume of such structure at
the time of adoption of this chapter or subsequent amendments
that made the use nonconforming. A nonconforming use which
occupies part of a structure may be extended throughout the
structure it occupied at the time of adoption of this chapter or
subsequent amendment that made the use nonconforming, but
the expansion under such circumstances may not be extended
to occupy land outside the original structure.
(2) If any such nonconforming use of land or use of land and structures
in combination ceases or is abandoned for any reason, including
destruction of buildings, for a period of at least one year, any
subsequent use of such land, or land and structures in combination,
must conform to the regulations for the zone where such land is
located, except that where a hardship to the operator of the
nonconforming use clearly exists as a result of financial, health or
other calamity, the Zoning Hearing Board may grant an extension
of the one-year limit consistent with the hardship, but not more
than one additional year.
(3) The nonconforming use of a structure or a lot may be changed only
to a conforming use, unless:
(a) The applicant demonstrates a hardship in converting the use to
a conforming use; or
(b) The new use will be in keeping with the character of the
neighborhood in which it is located and will have an equal or
lesser impact on the neighborhood than the existing
nonconforming use. However, this requirement does not
preclude an owner from selling a nonconforming use to a
succeeding owner to operate as it was operated prior to the
sale. Each succeeding owner of a nonconforming use must
secure a zoning certificate of compliance from the Zoning
Officer, who may ask the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision if
he has reason to doubt that the nonconforming use will be
continued in the same manner as formerly.
(4) The nonconforming use of a structure and/or land, or combination
of structure and land, may be superseded by a use permitted in the
zone where the lot is located, and the use of the premises must
conform to the regulations of the zone.
(5) Where a nonconforming use of structure and premises exists in
combination, removal of the structure and/or use in the structure
terminates the nonconforming use of the premises.
§ 615-24 ETNA CODE § 615-24
1:574
(6) The maintaining or strengthening to a safe condition of any
nonconforming structure may not be interpreted as being denied
by any portion of this article.
C. Nonconforming structures.
(1) A structure that exists on a lot at the effective date of this chapter
or any amendment to it and does not conform to the requirements
regarding height or minimum setbacks from adjacent streets or lot
lines, such structure may remain indefinitely, subject to the
following provisions.
(2) Any replacement of a nonconforming structure must be made in
compliance with the regulations governing development for the
zone in which the lot is located, except that if a hardship is alleged
by the owner, he may request a special exception of the Zoning
Hearing Board, which may approve replacement on the same
foundation that supported the structure to be replaced, but in no
case a location that was less conforming than the original location.
(3) If a nonconforming structure is moved, it must conform to
requirements of this chapter regarding location on the lot.
D. Record of nonconforming uses.
(1) The Zoning Officer must keep the data current by the addition of
nonconforming uses as amendments to this chapter are adopted
and by the deletion of nonconforming uses as they are eliminated.
(2) The record may be kept by map or written documentation.

Municipal Comprehensive Plan. See also the Municipalities Planning Code
§ 609.92
§ 615-26. Rezoning application forms.
Rezoning applications are completed on the official forms provided by the
Zoning Officer. All applicants submitting rezoning applications are required
to prepare a series of plans, analyses and reports as enumerated in § 615-28
to demonstrate the compatibility of a rezoning proposal.
§ 615-27. Review of rezoning applications.
A. The Zoning Officer:

C. The Borough Planning Commission:
(1) Will consider any projected beneficial and/or detrimental effects on
the Borough and may host a public hearing on the application if it
deems it applicable.
(2) Submit a written recommendation either in favor or not in favor of
the rezoning proposal, including a specific statement as to whether
or not the proposed rezoning is in accordance with the objectives of

demands and impacts identified in § 615-28D on adjoining lots, the
Borough Council may require a landowner and/or developer to prepare
other potential related studies. The Borough Planning Commission and
the Borough Council reserve the right to request additional information
as part of the rezoning review and approval process in order to evaluate
the applicability of the rezoning.
§ 615-27 ETNA CODE § 615-28
1:578
ARTICLE IX
Permits
§ 615-29. Zoning permit.
A. A zoning permit shall be required prior to:
(1) A change in use of land or structure.
(2) The placement, erection or construction of a structure, or portion
thereof, that has a fair market value exceeding $500, including but
not limited to fences, except that a permit shall be required prior to
the erection of a fence that is located within a floodplain,
regardless of its cost.
(3) The alteration or improvement of any existing structure, where
such improvement or portion thereof increases the amount of space
which the structure encloses.
(4) The alteration or development of any improved or unimproved real
estate.
(5) The erection or alteration of any signs specified in this chapter.
B. No zoning permit shall be required for repairs or maintenance of any
structure or land, provided such repairs do not change the use or the
exterior dimensions of the structure, or otherwise violate the provisions
of this chapter.
C. Application for zoning permits shall be submitted to the Zoning Officer.
D. Such zoning permits shall be granted or denied, in whole or in part,
within 30 business days of the filing date.
E. No zoning permit shall be issued except in conformity with:
(1) All applicable regulations of this chapter.
(2) Any conditions imposed upon the site by the Zoning Hearing Board
or the Borough Council.
(3) Any recorded subdivision or land development plan.
F. In all instances in which the Zoning Officer expresses a reasonable
doubt as to the ability of a proposed use or improvement to meet all of
the above-described requirements, it will be incumbent upon the
applicant to furnish adequate evidence in support of his application. If
such evidence is not presented, the zoning permit will be denied.
G. Application for a zoning permit shall be made by the owner or lessee of
any building or structure or the agent of either; provided, however, that
if the application is made by a person other than the owner or lessee it
shall be accompanied by a written authorization of the owner or the
qualified person making an application that the proposed work is
§ 615-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 615-29
1:579
authorized by the owner. The full names and addresses of the owner,
lessee, applicant and of the responsible officers, if the owner or lessee
is a corporate body, shall be stated in the application.
H. The Zoning Officer may call upon other Borough staff and/or Boroughappointed
consultants in the review of submitted materials for
applications.
I. The Zoning Officer may revoke a zoning permit or approval issued
under the provisions of this chapter in case of any false statement or
misrepresentation of fact in the application or on the plans on which the
zoning permit or approval was based or for any other cause set forth in
this chapter.
J. No permit shall be issued until the fee, in an amount as established
from time to time by resolution of the Borough Council, is paid to the
Borough. The payment of fees under this section shall not relieve the
applicant or holder of said permit from payment of other fees that may
be required by this chapter or by any other ordinances or law. Where a
permit is required by this chapter, but the work is commenced or the
use is commenced or changed prior to obtaining such zoning permit,
the fee set by resolution of the Board of Supervisors for such permit
shall be doubled. The doubling of the permit fee shall be required to
reflect the additional expense incurred by the Borough resulting from
the need to inspect the property, respond to any complaints, issue any
enforcement notices and/or process the application as soon as it is
received. The payment of such increased permit fee shall not relieve
any person from complying with all requirements of this chapter or any
other applicable Borough ordinances or from any penalties or
enforcement actions authorized by this chapter or the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.
K. Issuance of zoning permits. Upon receiving the application, the Zoning
Officer shall examine the same within a reasonable time after filing. If
the application or plans do not conform to the provisions of all pertinent
local laws, the Zoning Officer shall reject such application in writing
stating the reasons therefor and informing the applicant of his or her
right to appeal the Zoning Officer's decision to the Zoning Hearing
Board. If satisfied that the proposed work and/or use conforms to the
provisions of this chapter and all laws and ordinances applicable
thereto, and that the certificate of use and occupancy as required
herein has been applied for, the Zoning Officer shall grant or deny a
permit application, in whole or in part, within 30 business days of the
filing date.
L. Reconsideration of application. An applicant whose request for a permit
has been denied by the Zoning Officer may make a later application for
a zoning permit, provided all deficiencies which were the basis for the
prior denial of the permit have been eliminated. The Zoning Officer
shall not be required to conduct a new review of the application if this
condition is not met.
§ 615-29 ETNA CODE § 615-29
1:580
§ 615-30. Building permits.
M. Expiration of permit. The zoning permit shall expire after one year from
the date of issuance; provided, however, that the same may be extended
every six months for a period not to exceed an additional two years,
upon written request by the applicant which demonstrates good cause
to the Zoning Officer. When a zoning permit is issued in conjunction
with a building permit, the zoning permit shall remain valid so long as
the building permit is valid. A permit may be valid for no more than five
years from its issue date.
N. Compliance with this chapter. The zoning permit shall be a license to
proceed with the work and should not be construed as authority to
violate, cancel or set aside any of the provisions of this chapter, except
as stipulated by this chapter. The issuance of a zoning permit does not
indicate that a building permit can be issued nor is it to be considered a
license to begin work where a building permit is also required.
O. Compliance with zoning permit and plot plan. All improvements or uses
shall conform to the approved application and plans for which the
zoning permit has been issued as well as the approved plot plan.
P. Display of zoning permit. All approved zoning permits shall be
prominently displayed on the subject property during construction,
renovation, reconstruction, repair, remodeling or the conduct of other
site improvements. Such permit displays shall occur within five days of
permit issuance or prior to the commencement of actual work on the
site, whichever occurs first. Such permit display shall be continuous
until the site receives its certificate of use and occupancy.
Q. Application requirements associated with zoning permits are available
at the Etna Borough Municipal Building Administrative Office.
A. No building or structure can be erected, added to or structurally
altered until a permit has been issued by the Zoning Officer. No building
permit can be issued for any building where construction, addition or
alteration or use thereof would be in violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter, except after written order from the Zoning Hearing Board.
Any building permit issued in conflict with the provisions of this chapter
is null and void.
B. All applications for building permits are to be accompanied by plans in
duplicate as determined by the Zoning Officer, drawn to scale, showing
the actual dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon; the exact
sizes and locations on the lot of building already existing, if any; and the
location and dimensions of the proposed building or alteration. The
application includes such other information as the Zoning Officer
requires, including existing or proposed uses of the building and land;
the number of households or units the building is designed to
accommodate; conditions existing on the lot; and such other matters as
may be necessary to determine conformance with and provide for the
§ 615-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 615-30
1:581
enforcement of this chapter. One copy of the plans, denoted with
approval or disapproval, will be returned to the applicant, and one copy,
similarly marked, retained on Borough file.
C. A building permit for any building or use may be revoked and
withdrawn by the Zoning Officer if the holder of the building permit has
failed to comply with the requirements of this chapter or with any
conditions attached to the issuance of the permit, and the holder of the
building permit may be subject to penalties as provided by this chapter.
D. The Building Inspector has 30 days to review and act upon a building
permit application.
E. If the work described in any building permit has not begun within 90
days from the date of issuance, the building permit expires. The Zoning
Officer will notify the applicant of such expiration. If the work described
in any building has not been substantially completed within two years of
the date of issuance thereof, said permit and any other zoning relief
expires and will be canceled, with written notification, by the Zoning
Officer. An applicant has 10 days to apply for renewal of zoning relief
and issuance of a new building permit.
F. All buildings for which permits have been obtained and the construction
of which has begun, or for which a contract or contracts have been
issued pursuant to a permit granted prior to the date of adoption of this
chapter, may be completed and used in accordance with the plans on
which said permit was granted.
G. Unless otherwise required by another portion of the Borough's Code of
Ordinances, all public and private construction, demolition and grading
work and related activities performed pursuant to a building permit can
be performed between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday
through Saturday, and no such work can be performed at any time on
Sundays or federal holidays unless the permittee obtains written
consent from the Borough Manager, and/or his or her agent, to do the
work at an earlier or later hour or on said days.
H. In connection with the granting of any permit, the Zoning Officer and/or
the Borough Manager may, in his or her discretion, attach such
conditions thereto as may be necessary to prevent damage to public or
private property or to prevent the operation from being conducted in a
manner hazardous to life or property or in a manner likely to create a
nuisance, including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be
performed.
(2) Restrictions as to the size, weight and type of equipment.
(3) Designation of routes upon which materials may be transported.

neighborhood, the general public or any portion thereof.
(7) Regulations as to the use of streets in the course of the work in the
Borough.
(8) Regulations as to the use of a mechanical device for the breaking of

Officer and/or the Borough Manager.
(9) Requirements that the building permitted area be completely
fenced in, with a designated point of ingress and egress, and with
such fencing to be of sufficient height and transparency so as to
protect public health, welfare and safety.
A. It is unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any
building or lot, in whole or in part, erected, connected or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its size or structure, until an occupancy
permit has been issued by the Zoning Officer.
B. No nonconforming use may be changed or extended until an occupancy
permit has been issued by the Zoning Officer.
C. Occupancy permits applied for coincident with an approvable building
permit application will be issued within five working days after the
erection or alteration has been completed and inspected by the Zoning
Officer.
D. Application for occupancy permits for a new or changed use of land
where no building permit is required can be made directly to the office
of the Zoning Officer. Occupancy permits to be issued, as well as
written notices stating why an occupancy permit cannot be issued, will
be given to the applicant no later than 10 days after the application has
been received by the Zoning Officer.
E. A temporary occupancy permit for owner-occupied development may
be issued by the Zoning Officer for a period not exceeding six months
during alterations as partial occupancy of a building pending its
completion, provided that such temporary permit may require such
conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants
and the public.

not be limited to traffic circulation, parking, public conveniences,
signs and any other special operating characteristics.

and, if said permission is granted by ordinance, may enter upon and open
the streets, roads, lanes, and alleys of the said Borough and lay down
pipes thereon with the necessary street boxes, valves, escape pipes and
connections subject to the provisions of this ordinance96 and any other
reasonable rules, regulations, ordinances or by-laws which by the said
Burgess and Town Council of the said Borough of Etna may hereafter from
time to time be adopted or passed.97
§ A621-2. Location of high-pressure lines; maximum pressure for
mains of various diameters.
High-pressure lines shall be laid on the front of the Allegheny River or along
