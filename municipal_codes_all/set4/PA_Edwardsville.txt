A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the validity of this Ordinance or the Zoning Map, or any provision thereof, which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest, may submit a curative amendment to the Borough Council with a written request that his challenge and proposed amendment to cure the alleged defect, be heard and decided by the Borough Council.  In addition to the written request and proposed amendment, the landowner shall also submit plans, drawings and explanatory material, which describes in detail his proposed use or development.  The Borough Council shall commence a public hearing pursuant to public notice within sixty 
(60) days of the landowner's request.  The sixty (60) day period shall not commence until all required information and material is submitted, along with all related fees. Failure to 
convene a public hearing within sixty (60) days of the landowner’s request shall not result 
in a deemed approval. 
The curative amendment and supporting information shall be referred to the Borough Planning Commission and the Luzerne County Planning Commission for its review and comment not less than thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing.  
The public hearing before the Borough Council shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable procedures contained in Section 1406 of this Ordinance and all references therein to the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for the purposes of this Section, be references to the Borough Council. Public notice of the required public hearing shall include notice of the validity of those particular provisions of this Ordinance and/or the Zoning Map which are in question, along with the place where the proposed amendment, plans, drawings, explanatory material and any other pertinent information may be examined by the public. 
If the Borough Council determines that a validity challenge has merit, it may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without revisions, or it may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects.  The Borough Council shall consider in 
addition to the landowner’s proposed curative amendment, plans, drawings and 
explanatory material the following items: 
(A)   	
The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water supplies, schools and other public service facilities. 

(B)   	
If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of this Ordinance and/or Zoning Map. 

(C) 	
The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed in relationship to the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, flood plains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural features. 

(D)   	
The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, flood plains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural features, in relationship to the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse environmental impacts. 

(E)   	
The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and any other land uses which are essential to the public health and welfare. 

The proposed curative amendment shall be deemed denied in accordance with any of the following: 

(A) 	
Failure to commence the public hearing within sixty (60) days of the landowner’s request. 

(B)   	
When the Borough Council notifies the landowner that it will not adopt the curative amendment. 

(C) 	
When the Borough Council adopts another curative amendment which is unacceptable to the landowner. 

(D)   	
When the Borough Council fails to act on the request within forty-five (45) days after the close of the last public hearing on the request, unless the time is extended by mutual consent by the landowner and the Borough Council 



1303.2 INITIATED BY THE BOROUGH 
If the Borough Council determines this Ordinance or the Official Zoning Map, or any portion thereof, to be substantially invalid, it shall declare such by a formal action and propose to prepare a curative amendment to overcome such invalidity.  Within thirty (30) days following said declaration, the Borough Council shall by resolution make specific findings setting forth the declared invalidity which may include: 
(A)   	
References to specific uses which are either not permitted or not permitted in sufficient quantity. 

(B)   	
Reference to a class of use or uses which require revision. 

(C) 	
Reference to the entire Ordinance and/or Map which requires revisions. 


Within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the declaration and proposal as set forth in this Section, the Borough Council shall enact a curative amendment to correct those portions deemed invalid or reaffirm the validity of those portions initially deemed to be invalid.  Upon the initiation of procedures as set forth in this Section, the Borough Council shall not be required to entertain or consider any landowner's curative amendment, nor shall the Zoning Hearing Board be required to consider a substantive challenge to the validity of the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map, pursuant to Section 1508 (A) of this Ordinance, based upon grounds identical to or substantially similar to those specified in the Borough Council resolution.  
The Borough Council, having utilized the procedures as set forth in this Section, may not again utilize said procedure for a thirty-six (36) month period following the date of the enactment of a curative amendment or reaffirmation of the validity of this Ordinance and/or Zoning Map.  However, if after the date of declaration and proposal, there is a substantially new duty or obligation imposed upon Borough by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, Borough may utilize the provisions of this Section to prepare a curative amendment to fulfill said duty or obligation.

That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in 
which the property is located.

ORDINANCE NO. 19 of 2010
AN ORDINANCE OF THE BOROUGH OF EDWARDSVILLE,
LUZERNE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, REGULATING
RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNIT OCCUPANCY AND
PROVIDING FOR INSPECTIONS AND PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNIT OCCUPANCY ORDINANCE
NOW, THEREFORE, be it ordained and enacted by the Borough Council of the Borough
of Edwardsville and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same as follows:
Section I:Title
This Ordinance shall be known as the Borough of Edwardsville “Residential Rental Unit
Occupancy Ordinance.”
Section II: General
It is the purpose of this Ordinance and the policy of the Council of the Borough of
Edwardsville, in order to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare of its citizens,
to establish rights and obligations of owners and occupants relating to the rental of certain
residential rental units in the Borough of Edwardsville and to encourage owners and occupants to
maintain and improve the quality of rental housing within the community. It is also the policy of
the Borough that owners, managers and occupants share responsibilities to obey the various
codes adopted to protect and promote public health, safety and welfare. As a means to those
ends, this Ordinance provides for a system of inspections, issuance and renewal of occupancy
licenses and sets penalties for violations. This Ordinance shall be liberally construed and applied
to promote its purposes and policies. In considering the adoption of this Ordinance, the Borough
of Edwardsville finds that in recent years, many formerly private homes have been turned into
residential rental units. Those rental units have often times been rented to individuals who,
because they have no ownership interest in the property, have allowed the properties to
deteriorate. In many cases, the owners of the properties live long distances from the Borough of
Edwardsville. As a result, property maintenance of many rental units in the Borough of
Edwardsville has been somewhat lax. In addition, problems have occurred because many tenants,
because they have no ownership interest in the real estate, have not been concerned about
following Codes of the Borough of Edwardsville, including Codes which govern maintenance
and safety of the property. This, in turn, has caused problems for other home owners near the
rental units. In addition, there is a greater incidence of violations of various Codes of the
Borough of Edwardsville in residential rental properties where owners rent properties to tenants.
