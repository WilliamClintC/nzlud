Normal Retirement Benefits12
§ 31-4. Eligibility requirements.
A member will be eligible for normal retirement benefits, provided that he
retires from the Borough's employment and, upon such retirement, he has
attained at least age 65 and has completed at least five years of service.
§ 31-5. Benefit commencement date.
Monthly benefits as described in § 31-6 will commence on the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the member's date of retirement. If
the member retires on other than the first day of a month, he will receive
a pension payment for his initial month of retirement equal to the amount
described in § 31-6 multiplied by the ratio of the days he is retired in the
month to the full number of days in the month.
§ 31-6. Amount of benefits.
§ 31-7. Normal form of payment.
Benefits as described in § 31-6 will be paid in the form of a monthly annuity
for the member's lifetime only.
§ 31-8. Optional forms of payment.
In lieu of receiving benefits in the normal form (a life annuity for the
member's lifetime only), a member may, in accordance with § 31-30, elect
to receive actuarially reduced benefits under a form of payment which
provides survivor benefits.
A. For any eligible member retiring prior to October 1, 2002, such eligible
member's monthly pension will be equal in amount to 1% of his average
salary at time of retirement, multiplied by his years of service at
retirement (not to exceed 35 years).
B. For any member retiring on or after October 1, 2002, such eligible
member's monthly pension will be equal in amount to 1.2% of his
average salary at time of retirement, multiplied by his years of service
at retirement (not to exceed 35 years).
12.Editor's Note: This article also included the following example: Mary Jones retires prior to
October 1, 2002, at age 65 with 25 years of service. Her average salary at retirement is
$2,000 per month. Mary would be entitled to a monthly pension of $500 (i.e., 1% x 25 x
$2,000) payable for her lifetime. Mary could elect to receive reduced benefits under an
optional form that provides survivor benefits. For example, if Mary's husband was age 68,
she could elect to receive benefits under the fifty-percent surviving spouse option, in
which case she would receive $453.79 monthly for life, and, upon her death, $226.90
monthly would continue to her husband for the rest of his life.

§ 31-10. Benefit commencement date.
An eligible member may elect to have benefits as described in § 31-11
commence on the first day of any month coincident with or following his
date of retirement. If the member retires on other than the first day of a
month and elects to have benefits commence immediately, he will receive
a pension payment for his initial month of retirement equal to the amount
described in § 31-11 multiplied by the ratio of the days he is retired in the
month to the full number of days in the month.
§ 31-11. Amount of benefits.
§ 31-12. Normal form of payment.
Benefits as described in § 31-11 will be paid in the form of a monthly annuity
for the member's lifetime only.
A. For any eligible member retiring prior to October 1, 2002, such eligible
member's monthly pension will be equal in amount to 1% of his average
salary at time of retirement multiplied by his years of service at
retirement (not to exceed 35 years), reduced by 5/12 of 1% for each
month by which the member's benefit commencement date precedes
the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
member's 65th birthday.
B. For any eligible member retiring on or after October 1, 2002, such
eligible member's monthly pension will be equal in amount to 1.2% of
his average salary at time of retirement multiplied by his years of
service at retirement (not to exceed 35 years), reduced by 3/12 of 1%
for each month by which the member's benefit commencement date
precedes the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
member's 65th birthday.
13.Editor's Note: This article also included the following example: Tom Smith retires on his
60th birthday with 20 years of service. His average salary at retirement is $1,800 per
month. He retires prior to October 1, 2002. Tom would be entitled to a monthly pension of
$360 (i.e., 1% x 20 x $1,800) commencing at age 65 and payable for his lifetime.
Alternatively, Tom could elect to have reduced benefits commence on the first day of any
month preceding his 65th birthday. For example, if Tom elected to have benefits
commence immediately at age 60, his age-sixty-five benefit of $360 would be reduced by
25% (i.e., 5/12 of 1% x 60 months) to $270 per month payable for his lifetime. Tom would
also have the opportunity to elect to have his early retirement benefits paid under an
optional form that provides survivor benefits.

A member will be eligible for disability retirement benefits if he suffers a
disability on or after October 31, 2002, as a result of the performance of
his duties as a Borough employee and such disability prevents the member
from continuing to perform his duties as a Borough employee. The
determination of whether or not the member has suffered such a disability
shall be made by the Pension Committee on the basis of a written report of
a physician or physicians designated by the Pension Committee.
§ 31-15. Benefit commencement date.
Monthly benefits as described in § 31-16 will commence on the first day
of the month coincident with or next following the member's date of

benefit equal to 75% of earnings, less an amount equal to the benefits to
which such eligible member is entitled to receive under the Pennsylvania
Workers' Compensation Act (77 P.S. § 1 et seq.). If such eligible member
receives a lump sum settlement under the Pennsylvania Workers'
Compensation Act, then the monthly off-set to the benefit shall be the
actuarial equivalent of said lump sum settlement.
§ 31-17. Earnings. [Amended 9-18-2007 by Ord. No. 2049, approved
9-18-2007]
For the purposes of determining benefits under § 31-16 only, "earnings"
shall mean the average wages received by the member for the last 36
months of employment with the Borough, including wages for overtime, but
excluding any payment for comp time, accumulated sick time, accumulated
vacation or bonuses. Earnings shall not include any monies paid by the
Borough to any Member for any other reason.
§ 31-18. Form of payment.
Benefits as described in § 31-16 will be paid in the form of a monthly
annuity for the member's lifetime with survivor benefits described in Article

retirement date, the Pension Committee may require a member receiving a
disability pension to be reexamined by a physician or physicians designated
§ 31-14 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 31-19
29:45
by the Pension Committee. If such physician or physicians find that the
member is able to again perform his duties as a Borough employee, such
member shall be restored to active duty and his disability pension shall be
discontinued. If such member refuses or fails to accept such restoration to
active duty, his disability pension shall, nevertheless, be discontinued.

Vested Termination Benefits14
§ 31-20. Eligibility requirements.
A member will be eligible for vested termination benefits, provided that he
terminates employment with the Borough after he has completed at least
five years of service but prior to meeting the eligibility requirements for
normal retirement or early retirement benefits.

An eligible member who has completed at least 15 years of service at
termination may elect to have monthly benefits as described in § 37-22
commence on the first day of any month coincident with or following his
55th birthday. In the case of an eligible member who has completed less
than 15 years of service at termination, benefits as described in § 31-22 will
commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following
the member's 65th birthday.
§ 31-22. Amount of benefits.
§ 31-23. Normal form of payment.
Benefits as described in § 31-22 will be paid in the form of a monthly annuity
for the member's lifetime only.
A. For any eligible member who retires prior to October 1, 2002, such
eligible member's monthly pension will be equal in amount to 1% of his
average salary at time of termination multiplied by his years of service
at termination (not to exceed 35 years), reduced by 5/12 of 1% for each
month by which the member's benefit commencement date precedes
the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
member's 65th birthday.
B. For any eligible member who retires on or after October 1, 2002, such
eligible member's monthly pension will be equal in amount to 1.2% of
his average salary at time of termination multiplied by his years of
service at termination (not to exceed 35 years), reduced by 3/12 of 1%
for each month by which the member's benefit commencement date
precedes the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
member's 65th birthday.

employment at age 40 with 15 years of service. Her average salary at termination is
$1,500 per month. She retires prior to October 1, 2002. Kathy would be entitled to a
monthly benefit of $225 (i.e., 1% x15 x $1,500) commencing at age 65 and continuing for
her lifetime. Alternatively, since she has 15 years of service, she could elect to have
reduced benefits commence as early as age 55. For example, if she did elect to have
benefits commence at age 55, her age-sixty-five benefit of $225 would be reduced by 50%
(i.e., 5/12 of 1% x 120 months) to $112.50 per month payable for her lifetime. Kathy would
also have the opportunity to elect to have her benefits paid under an optional form that
provides survivor benefits.

If a member dies prior to actual retirement but after having met the age
and service requirements for normal or early retirement benefits, 50% of
the benefit the member would have received had he been retired on his
date of death will be continued to his surviving spouse while she remains
unremarried. Benefits will commence on the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the member's date of death. In addition, if
the member died on other than the first day of the month, a partial payment
will be paid for the member's month of death equal to a full month's benefit
multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month, including and
following the member's date of death, to the full number of days in the
month.
§ 31-26. Termination of employment.
If a member dies after having terminated employment with the Borough
with entitlement to deferred vested benefits under Article VI but before
such benefits have commenced, 50% of the benefit the member was
scheduled to receive will be paid to his surviving spouse while she remains
unremarried, with benefits commencing on the member's scheduled benefit
commencement date. (See § 31-21.)
§ 31-27. Benefits to children.
If there is no eligible unremarried spouse to receive survivor benefits as
described in §§ 31-25, 31-26 and 31-28, each child of the member, while
such child is under age 18, shall equally share the benefits otherwise

Other provisions relating to the payment of benefits under the plan
notwithstanding, if the actuarial equivalent lump sum value (i.e., the
present value) of benefits initially due a member or beneficiary is $5,000 or
less, the member or beneficiary may elect to receive such lump sum in lieu
of the payments otherwise due the member or beneficiary.
§ 31-30.2. Funding of plan.
The plan is subject to the minimum funding requirements of the
Pennsylvania Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act

elect to have benefits paid under an optional form of payment which
differs from the normal form of payment (which is a life annuity for the
member's lifetime only with no survivor benefits). In such case, the
benefit payable under the optional form will be the actuarial equivalent
of the benefit payable under the normal form.
B. Optional forms available.
(1) Fifty-percent spouse annuity. Upon the retired member's death,
50% of the monthly benefit the member had been receiving will be
continued to the member's spouse for life.
(2) One-hundred-percent spouse annuity. Upon the member's death,
100% of the monthly benefit the member had been receiving will be
continued to the member's spouse for life.
(3) Life annuity with 10 years certain. A monthly annuity payable for
the member's lifetime. If the member dies before receiving at least
120 monthly payments, payments will continue to the member's
beneficiary until a grand total of 120 payments have been made to
the member and beneficiary combined. If the member dies after
having received at least 120 payments, no survivor benefits are
payable.

it to properly carry out its duties, including but not limited to the power
to construe the provisions of the plan, to determine all questions

transactions of the pension fund and shall keep in convenient form such
data as may be necessary for the actuarial valuations and computations
under the plan. Each year, the Pension Committee shall submit to the

designated from time to time by the Borough Council. The trustee shall
administer the pension fund in accordance with the provisions of a trust
agreement to be executed by the trustee and the Borough Council,
which trust agreement may be amended from time to time by the
Borough Council. The trustee shall not be liable to any member or to a

pension fund is then insufficient to provide such accrued benefits in full.
B. Subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania governing
nonuniformed full-time employees pension plans, the plan may be
discontinued by the Borough, but it shall be impossible for any part of
the pension fund to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than the
exclusive benefit of members, except such part as represents an
actuarial surplus after provision for all accrued benefits under the plan.
C. Any other provisions of the plan to the contrary notwithstanding,
benefits payable from the plan shall in no circumstances exceed the
maximum benefit limitations of Section 415 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code, nor shall compensation in excess of the

date designated in the notice, whichever is later. The amount of the early
retirement benefit shall be the actuarial equivalent of a vested retirement
benefit as computed in Article XIV. The actuarial equivalent of the vested
retirement benefit shall be determined by actuarially reducing the vested
retirement benefit to reflect that it will commence on the effective date of
the early retirement rather than on the member's normal retirement date.
The actuarial reduction shall be calculated using the actuarial assumptions
reported in the last actuarial valuation report filed with the Public Employee
Retirement Commission.

ARTICLE XIII
Disability Retirement Benefits21
§ 31-39. Eligibility requirements.
A member will be eligible for disability retirement benefits if he suffers a
disability as a result of the performance of his duties as a Borough police
officer and such disability prevents the member from continuing to perform
his duties as a Borough police officer. The determination of whether or not
the member has suffered such a disability shall be made by the Pension
Committee on the basis of a written report of a physician or physicians
designated by the Pension Committee.
§ 31-40. Benefit commencement date.
Monthly benefits as described in § 31-41 will commence on the first day
of the month coincident with or next following the member's date of
retirement on account of service-connected disability.
§ 31-41. Amount of benefits. [Amended 7-20-2010 by Ord. No. 2075,
approved 7-20-2010; 2-21-2017 by Ord. No. 2115, approved
2-21-2017]
A. Officer hired before January 1, 2015. If an officer hired before January
1, 2015, is permanently disabled from performing police work for the
Borough as the result of a service-connected disability, the officer shall
receive 75% of his wages (which will include all monies received in the
twelve- month period preceding retirement). Such benefit shall be
offset by social security disability ("SSD") income received by the officer
due to the same injury or illness that resulted in the service-connected
disability pension. This pension should continue until the death of the
officer and thereafter to the officer's survivors, as defined by Act 600. In
no event should the officer's pension (exclusive of benefits) exceed
100% of his/her wages after taxes as received in the twelve-month
period preceding retirement.
B. Officer hired on or after January 1, 2015. If an officer hired on or after
January 1, 2015, is permanently disabled from performing police work
for the Borough as the result of a service-connected disability, the
officer shall receive 50% of his wages (which will include all monies
received in the twelve-month period preceding retirement). If such
officer qualifies for social security disability income due to the same
injury or illness that resulted in the service-connected disability
pension, the disability pension shall be 75% of his wages, subject to an
21.Editor's Note: This article also included the following example: Officer Smith retires at
age 45 with 20 years of service, on account of a service-connected disability. During his 12
months of employment, his earnings are $43,200, for an average of $3,600 per month.
Officer Smith would be entitled to a monthly pension of $2,700 (i.e., 75% of $3,600). Upon
Officer Smith's death, 50% of his monthly benefit, i.e. $1,350, would be continued to his
surviving spouse or, if there is no such spouse, to his children under the age of 18 or, if
attending college, under or attaining the age of 23, in equal shares. This example was
amended 7-20-2010 by Ord. No. 2075, approved 7-20-2010.

§ 31-42. Earnings. [Amended 7-20-2010 by Ord. No. 2075, approved
7-20-2010]
For purposes of determining benefits under § 31-41 only, "earnings" shall
be all monies received in the twelve-month period preceding disability
retirement.
§ 31-43. Form of payment.
Benefits as described in § 31-41 will be paid in the form of a monthly
annuity for the member's lifetime with survivor benefits described in Article
XV. Cost-of-living adjustments shall not be applied to disability retirement
benefits.
§ 31-44. Determination of continuance of disability.
At any time prior to the member reaching what would have been his normal
retirement date, the Pension Committee may require a member receiving a
disability pension to be reexamined by a physician or physicians designated
by the Pension Committee. If such physician or physicians find that the
member is able to again perform his duties as a Borough police officer, such
member shall be restored to active duty and his disability pension shall be
discontinued. If such member refuses or fails to accept such restoration to
active duty, his disability pension shall, nevertheless, be discontinued.
offset for the SSD income received. This pension should continue until
the death of the officer and thereafter to the officer's survivors, defined
by Act 600. In no event should the officer's pension (exclusive of
benefits) exceed 100% of his wages after taxes as received in the
twelve-month period preceding retirement.
C. Non-service connected disability benefits.
(1) If an officer hired before January 1, 2015, is permanently and
totally disabled as a result of a non-service-connected disability, the
officer shall receive a disability pension that is 50% of his/her
annual base salary at the time of retirement until the officer returns
to work or until death. An officer shall not be eligible for this
pension if the disability:
(a) Was intentionally self-inflected;
(b) Resulted from the use of drugs or alcohol; or
(c) Resulted from employment other than as a police officer for the
Borough.
(2) The disabled officer shall be entitled to purchase, through the
Borough, medical insurance coverage (as then offered by the
Borough); provided, however, that such coverage shall be at the
cost of the individual officer and not the cost of the Borough.

ARTICLE XIV
Vested Termination Benefits22
§ 31-45. Eligibility requirements.
A member will be eligible for vested termination benefits, provided that he
terminates employment with the Borough after he has completed at least 12
years of service but prior to meeting the eligibility requirements for normal
retirement or disability benefits.
§ 31-46. Benefit commencement date.
Monthly benefits as described in § 31-47 will commence on the first day of
the month coincident with or next following the date on which the member
would have met the eligibility requirements for normal retirement benefits
(§ 31-34) had he continued employment as a full-time Borough police officer.
§ 31-47. Amount of benefits.
An eligible member's initial deferred monthly pension will be equal in
amount to 50% of his average salary at time of termination multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the member's years of service
at termination and the denominator of which is the years of service that
the member would accrue based on continued employment as a full-time
Borough police officer until the date he would have met the eligibility
requirements for normal retirement benefits, plus a service increment
benefit equal to the lesser of $8.34 for each full year of service in excess of
25 years or $100.
§ 31-48. Form of payment.
Benefits as described in § 31-47 will be paid in the form of a monthly annuity
for the member's lifetime only, with survivor benefits and annual cost-ofliving
adjustments as described in Articles XV and XVI, respectively.
22.Editor's Note: This article also included the following example: Officer Brown is hired at
age 23. His projected normal retirement age is age 50, at which time he will have 27 years
of service. Officer Brown terminates his employment with the Borough at age 41 after
completing 18 years of service. His average salary at the time of termination is $3,600.
Officer Brown would be entitled to a monthly pension, commencing at age 50 equal to
$1,200 (i.e., 50% x $3,600 x 18/27). He would not be eligible for a service increment
benefit since he has only 18 years of service. After it has commenced, his pension would
increase annually in accordance with the plan's cost-of-living feature, until it had
increased 30% to $1,560 per month. Upon Officer Brown's death, 50% of the benefit he
was receiving or scheduled to receive will be paid to his surviving spouse or, if there is no
such spouse, to his children under the age of 18 or, if attending college, under or
attaining the age of 23, in equal shares. Note that survivor benefits will not commence
until Officer Brown's scheduled benefit commencement date if he dies prior to such date.

ARTICLE XV
Survivor Benefits23
§ 31-49. Postretirement.
If a member dies after having commenced receiving retirement benefits
under Article XI, XIII or XIV, 50% of the benefit the member had been
receiving will be continued to his surviving spouse while she remains
unremarried. Benefits will commence on the first of the month following the
member's date of death.
§ 31-50. Preretirement; vested eligibility. [Amended 7-20-2010 by
Ord. No. 2075, approved 7-20-2010]
A. If a member dies prior to actual retirement but after having met the age
and service requirements for normal retirement, 50% of the benefit the
member would have received had he retired on his date of death will be
continued to his surviving spouse. Benefits will commence on the first
day of the month coincident with or next following the member's date of
death. In addition, if the member died on a day other than the first day
of the month, a partial payment will be paid for the member's month of
death, equal to a full month's benefit multiplied by the ratio of the
number of days in the month, including and following the member's
date of death, to the full number of days in the month.
B. Vested eligibility. In the event that a member dies after completing 12
years of service but was not yet eligible for retirement, the survivor(s)
shall be entitled to:
(1) Receive payment of all money that the member invested in the
pension fund, with interest or other increases in value of the
members investment in the pension fund (unless the member has
designated another beneficiary for this purpose); or
23.Editor's Note: This article also included the following examples: Example 1: Officer Adams
dies on November 1, 1998, after having commenced receiving normal retirement benefits.
His initial benefit was $1,000 per month. At the time of his death, he was receiving $1,200
per month as a result of cost-of-living increases. A full $1,200 would be paid to Officer
Adams for the month of November, since he was still alive on the first day of the month.
Commencing December 1, 1998, his surviving unremarried spouse (or dependent
children) would receive a monthly benefit of $600. The monthly benefit of $600 would
remain constant and not be eligible for cost-of-living adjustments. Example 2: Officer
Evans dies while an active officer on November 21, 1998, at age 52 with 28 years of
service. His average salary at time of death is $3,400. If he had retired on his date of
death, he would have been entitled to a monthly pension of $1,725.02 (i.e., 50% x $3,400 +
$25.02 service increment benefit). Accordingly, his surviving unremarried spouse (or
dependent children) would be entitled to a monthly benefit of $862.51 (50% x $1,725.02)
commencing December 1, 1998. In addition, a partial payment would be made for the
month of November equal to $287.50 (i.e., $862.51 x 10 days ÷30 days). The $862.51
benefit would remain constant and not be eligible for cost-of-living adjustments. Example
3: Officer Franklin terminates employment at age 45 with 20 years of service with
entitlement to a deferred vested benefit of $1,000 per month commencing at age 50.
Officer Franklin dies at age 48. His surviving unremarried spouse (or dependent children)
would be entitled to a monthly benefit of $500 (i.e., 50% x $1,000) with benefits
commencing on Officer Franklin's projected benefit commencement date, i.e, when Officer
Franklin would have attained age 50. After the survivor benefit commenced, it would
remain constant at $500 and not be eligible for cost-of-living adjustments.

§ 31-50.1. Preretirement survivor benefit. [Added 2-21-2017 by Ord.
No. 2115, approved 2-21-2017]
In the event a police employee is killed in service, the police employee's
family shall receive the benefits provided for and subject to the terms of
Act 51 of 2009, which benefits are paid exclusively by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania with the exception of any pension benefit to which the police
employee was entitled prior to the police employee's death, solely by virtue
of the police employee's service with the Township (i.e., either a normal,
early, or vested pension benefit). It is understood that "family" shall refer
to the surviving spouse and dependent children. The benefit is payable to
the surviving spouse until death, then to the surviving dependent children
under the age of 18 years or, if attending college, under or attaining the age
of 23 years.
§ 31-51. Termination of employment.
If a member dies after having terminated employment with the Borough
with entitlement to deferred vested benefits under Article XIV but before
such benefits have commenced, 50% of the benefit the member was
scheduled to receive will be paid to his surviving spouse while she remains
unremarried, with benefits commencing on the member's scheduled benefit
commencement date. (See § 31-46.)
§ 31-52. Benefits to children. [Amended 7-20-2010 by Ord. No.
2075, approved 7-20-2010]
If there is no eligible spouse to receive survivor benefits as described in
§§ 31-49, 31-50 and 31-51, or if the spouse subsequently dies, then the
member's children under the age of 18 or, if attending college, under or
attaining the age of 23, shall be entitled to the benefits otherwise payable
to an eligible spouse, in equal shares.
§ 31-53. Cost-of-living adjustments.
No cost-of-living adjustments shall be applied to survivor benefits payable
under this article XV.
(2) Receive the vested benefit whereby the survivor(s) shall receive a
monthly benefit which shall be 50% of the members vested
monthly benefit as of the date the member would have been eligible
to receive the member's vested benefit.

§ 31-54. Cost-of-living increases.24
On each January 1 following his date of retirement, a member shall have
his pension increased in proportion to the increase in the Philadelphia Area
Consumer Price Index for the twelve-month period ending on the October
31 preceding the date of increase, subject to the following conditions:

applications of this cost-of-living provision, as described through
Subsection A, shall not exceed 130% of his initial retirement benefit.

requirements for retirement benefits (normal, disability or vested
termination benefits), he shall receive an immediate refund of his own
contributions to the plan with interest. If a member dies prior to
retirement and no survivor benefits are payable as described in Article
XV, the member's beneficiary shall receive an immediate refund of the
member's own contributions to the plan with interest.
B. If a member terminates employment after meeting the eligibility
requirements for retirement benefits (normal, disability or vested
termination benefits), the total benefits payable to the member and/or
his beneficiary shall not be less than the member's own contributions to
the plan with interest, as credited through the member's date of
termination.
24.Editor's Note: This section also included the following example: Officer Washington retires
on July 1, 1998, and receives a normal retirement pension of $2,000 per month. Assuming
that the Philadelphia Area Consumer Price Index increases 4% per annum, Officer

executors and administrators to be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of the plan.

A. The pension fund shall be held in trust by a trustee or trustees to be
designated from time to time by the Borough Council. The trustee shall
administer the pension fund in accordance with the provisions of a trust
agreement to be executed by the trustee and the Borough Council,
which trust agreement may be amended from time to time by the
Borough Council. The trustee shall not be liable to any member or to a
beneficiary of a member or any other person for the payments of any
benefits under the plan except to the extent expressly provided for in
the plan.
B. The trustee shall make payment of benefits under the plan only to the
extent, in the amounts, in the manner, at the time and to the persons as
§ 31-58 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 31-59
29:81
§ 31-60. Actuary.
The Borough Council shall employ an actuary to perform the required
periodic actuarial valuations of the plan. Such actuary shall be an approved
actuary as defined under the Pennsylvania Municipal Pension Plan Funding
Standard and Recovery Act (Act 205 of 1984).26
§ 31-61. Miscellaneous provisions.
shall from time to time be set forth or designated in written

on any other fund in the Borough Treasury or any fund under the
control of the Borough other than the pension fund.

to execution, attachment, garnishment or other legal process by any
creditor of a member, nor of any beneficiary of such member, except to
the extent required under the terms of a qualified domestic relations
order as such order pertains to divorce settlements. No member, nor
beneficiary of such member, shall have any right to alienate, encumber
or assign any of the benefits provided herein, or any interest arising out
of or created by the plan, but nothing herein contained shall be
construed to prevent the member from designating or changing the
designation of his beneficiary, provided that any change in designated
beneficiary occurs prior to the date a member has commenced
receiving benefits under the plan.
E. The expenses of the administration of the plan and pension fund shall
be paid from the pension fund to the extent permitted by applicable law
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Any administrative expenses of
the plan and pension fund not permitted to be paid from the pension

the plan.
A. This plan may be amended by the Borough if, as amended, it continues
to be for the exclusive benefit of members and continues to comply with
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania governing police
pension plans. Amendments may not reduce accrued benefits under the
plan except to the extent that the pension fund is then insufficient to
provide such accrued benefits in full.
B. Subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania governing
police pension plans, the plan may be discontinued by the Borough, but
it shall be impossible for any part of the pension fund to be used for, or
diverted to, purposes other than the exclusive benefit of members,
except such part as represents an actuarial surplus after provision for
all accrued benefits under the plan.
C. Any other provisions of the plan to the contrary notwithstanding,
benefits payable from the plan shall in no circumstances exceed the
maximum benefit limitations of Section 415 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code, nor shall compensation in excess of the
maximum permitted under Section 401(a)(17) of such code be taken
into account in calculating plan benefits.
D. A member or beneficiary may elect to have any portion of an eligible
rollover distribution transferred directly to an eligible retirement plan
as specified by the member or beneficiary. A distribution shall be
determined to be an eligible rollover distribution, and a plan shall be
determined to be an eligible retirement plan in accordance with Section
401(a)(31) and other applicable sections of the United States Internal
Revenue Code.
A. Title. This section shall be known as the "Glenolden Borough Act 44
Deferred Retirement Option Program."
B. Definitions. When used in this section, the below words shall have the
meaning indicated.
ACT 44 DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PROGRAM  The pension
payments plan approved by the Pennsylvania Legislature September
18, 2009, amending Title 53 as it relates to Municipal Police Pension
Plan.
ACT 44 PROGRAM ACCOUNT  Separate account created to accept
Act 44 Program participants' monthly pension check while an Act 44
Program participant, as well as any interest thereon.
§ 31-61 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 31-63
29:83
BOROUGH  Borough of Glenolden, Delaware County, Pennsylvania.
DROP PERIOD  Act 44 DROP period means the period beginning
as of the participating police officer's written election notice as
acknowledged by the employer and continuing until that police officer's
separation from employment as a police officer of the employer, but in
no event to exceed 36 months.
FUND or PLAN  The Municipal Police Pension Plan.
PARTICIPANT  A police officer who meets the eligibility for and has
executed the proper documents for participation in the Act 44 Program.
POLICE OFFICERS  Police officers of the Police Department.
C. Eligibility. Eligibility for the Act 44 Program shall be determined as
follows:
(1) Police officers who have not retired prior to the implementation of
the Act 44 Program may enter into the Act 44 Program on the first
day of any month coincident with, or following, the date when they
have completed 25 years of service and are 53 years of age.
D. Written election. Eligible officers who wish to be participants in the Act
44 Program must signify that intention in writing as follows:
(1) A police officer electing to participate in the Act 44 Program must
complete and execute an "Act 44 Program participation election
form" which shall evidence the member's election to participate in
the Act 44 Program. The form must be signed by the police officer
and be notarized and submitted to the Borough Secretary. The Act
44 Program participation election form shall include an irrevocable
notice to the Borough, by the police officer, that the police officer
shall resign from employment with the Police Department effective
on a specific date (the "resignation date") that is no later than 36
months from the effective date of the Act 44 Program election form.
A police officer shall cease to work as and may no longer be
employed as a police officer on the officer's resignation date, unless
the Borough properly terminates or honorably discharges the
officer prior to the resignation date. A participant may resign from
employment while in Act 44 Program status, which shall terminate
his/her participation in the Act 44 Program.
(2) In addition to the above information, the Act 44 Program
participation election form shall also advise the employee of the
following:
(a) An explanation of the participant's rights and obligations while
in Act 44 Program, including the participation period of 36
months;
(b) That, as a condition of Act 44 Program participation, the
participant foregos active participation in the Police Pension
Plan and foregos any recalculation of pension benefits to
§ 31-63 GLENOLDEN CODE § 31-63
29:84
include salary increases occurring after Act 44 Program
participation commences; and
(c) That the Act 44 Program participant's service while in Act 44
Program will not count as pension service nor will it entitle a
participant to any service increment benefits to which the
participant was not entitled prior to commencing Act 44
Program participation. Once an Act 44 Program participant
enters the Act 44 Program, the participant may not
subsequently leave and then reenter the Act 44 Program, even
if the employee separates from employment and subsequently
begins employment with the Borough again.
E. Benefit calculation. For all pension plan purposes, continuous service of
a police officer participating in the Act 44 Program shall remain as it
existed on the effective date of commencement of participation in the
Act 44 Program. Service thereafter shall not be recognized or used for
the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the Borough
Police Pension Plan. The average monthly compensation of the police
officer for pension calculation purposes shall remain as it existed on the
effective date of commencement of participation in the Act 44 Program.
Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be recognized or
used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the
Pension Program. The pension benefit payable to the members shall
increase only as a result of cost of living adjustments in effect on the
effective date of the member's participation in the Act 44 Program or by
applicable cost of living adjustments granted thereafter.
F. Accumulation of the Act 44 Program Account. The monthly retirement
benefits that would have been payable had the police officer elected to
cease employment and receive a normal retirement benefit shall, upon
the police officer commencing participation in Act 44 Program,
accumulate to the benefit of that officer and be paid into that police
officer's Act 44 Program account. Participants shall not have the option
of self-directed investment of their individual Act 44 Program account
while in the Act 44 Program. Instead, the monies shall be invested in a
fund to be identified and selected by the Borough in accordance with
applicable law so as to generate a rate of return of no less than 0% and
no more than 4.5%.
G. Accrual of nonpension benefits. After a police officer elects to
participate in the Act 44 Program, all other contractual benefits shall
continue to accrue with the exception of those provisions relating to the
Police Pension Plan.
H. Payout. Upon separation from employment, the Act 44 Program payout
options available to the Act 44 Program participant shall be as follows:
(1) The balance of the Act 44 Program participant's account, less
withholding taxes, if any, remitted to the Internal Revenue Service,
§ 31-63 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 31-63
29:85
shall be paid to the participant or the participant's surviving
beneficiary.
(2) The balance of the Act 44 Program participant's account shall be
paid directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as
defined by Internal Revenue Code § 402(c)(8)(b), or in the case of
an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a
deceased Act 44 Program participant, an eligible retirement
program that is an individual retirement account or an individual
retirement annuity as defined by Internal Revenue Code
§ 402(c)(9).
(3) If the Act 44 Program participant or beneficiary fails to make an
election within 60 days following the date of termination of Act 44
Program participation, then the Borough shall implement
Subsection H(1) above.
I. Service-connected disability during Act 44 Program. If an eligible DROP
participant becomes temporarily incapacitated during his participation
in the Act 44 Program, the police officer shall continue to participate in
the Act 44 Program as if fully employed. The police officer shall receive
disability pay in the same amount as disabled police officers that are not
participating in Act 44 Program. In no event shall a police officer on
temporary disability have the ability to draw from his Act 44 Program
account. However, notwithstanding any other provision in this
subsection, if a police officer is disabled and has not returned to work as
of the date of his required resignation, then such resignation shall take
precedence over all other provisions herein and said officer shall be
required to resign. Nothing contained in this program shall be
construed as conferring any legal rights upon any police officer or other
person to a continuation of employment nor shall participation in the
Act 44 Program supersede or limit in any way the right of the Borough
to lawfully discharge a police officer based upon their inability to
resume his or her full duties as a police officer. If an Act 44 Program
participant becomes eligible for a service-connected disability pension
and his/her employment is terminated due to an inability to continue in
service on grounds that render him eligible for a service-connected
disability pension, the monthly normal retirement benefit of the Act 44
Program participant shall be reclassified as being on account of a
service-connected disability. In no event shall an Act 44 participant's
monthly retirement benefit be recalculated. The Act 44 participant's
monthly retirement benefit shall remain 50% as calculated at the time
of entry into the Act 44 Program.
J. Death. If an Act 44 Program participant dies, the participant's eligibility
for the Act 44 Program shall terminate upon the date of death. In such
case, if the Act 44 Program account balances have not yet been paid
out, the participant's legal beneficiary shall have the same rights and
options as the participant to withdraw/roll over the account balance.
§ 31-63 GLENOLDEN CODE § 31-63
29:86
K. Forfeiture of benefits. Notwithstanding a police officer's status as an
Act 44 Program participant, a current or former participant who is
convicted or pleads guilty to engaging in criminal misconduct which
constitutes a "crime related to public office or public employment," as
that phrase is defined in Pennsylvania's Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S.
§§ 1311 through 1314, shall forfeit his right to receive a pension,
including any amounts currently deposited in the Act 44 Program
Account. In such a case, the participant shall only be entitled to receive
the contributions, if any, made by the participant to the Police Pension
Fund, without interest.
L. Cost of management for Act 44 Program. Reasonable costs or fees
associated with the implementation or their individual management of
the Act 44 Program account shall be paid directly and solely by the
participant and not by the Borough.
M. Amendment. Any amendments to the Act 44 Program section shall be
consistent with the provisions covering individual retirement option
plans set forth in any applicable collective bargaining agreement and
shall be binding upon all future Act 44 Program participants and upon
all Act 44 Program participants who have balances in their individual
retirement option accounts. The Act 44 Program may only be amended
by a written instrument, not by any oral agreement or past practice.
N. Construal of provisions. A police officer's election to participate in the
Act 44 Program shall in no way be construed as a limitation on the
Borough's right to suspend or to terminate a police officer for just cause
or to grant the police officer an honorable discharge based upon a
physical or mental inability to perform his or her duties.
O. Severability. The provisions of the Act 44 Program shall be severable:
and if any of its provisions shall be held to be unconstitutional or illegal,
the validity of any of the remaining provisions of the Act 44 Program
shall not be affected thereby. It is hereby expressly declared as the
intent of the Borough that the Act 44 Program would have been adopted
had such unconstitutional or illegal provision or provisions not been
included herein.
P. Effective date. The effective date of the Act 44 Program will be January
1, 2018.

§ 51-11. Purpose and intent.
The Borough of Glenolden has determined that the planting, cultivating
and growing of certain running noxious plants and grasses, particularly
those plants and/or grasses commonly referred to as "bamboo," within the
Borough of Glenolden has a negative impact on the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the Borough of Glenolden and the public at
large, as the uncontrolled planting, cultivating and growth of said bamboo
plants and grasses results in the destruction of private and public property
and constitutes a nuisance within the Borough. The Borough has therefore
determined that is in the best interests of its residents and the public at
large to control the planting, cultivating and/or growing of said bamboo
plants and grasses within the Borough of Glenolden, primarily by
prohibiting the future planting, cultivating and/or growing of said bamboo
plants and grasses within the Borough, and by requiring the use of barriers
to prevent the invasive spread of existing bamboo plants and grasses within
the Borough.
§ 51-12. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BAMBOO  Any monopodial (running) tropical or semi-tropical grasses
from the genera Bambusa including, but not limited to Bambusa,
Phyllostachys, and Pseudosasa as well as common bamboo, golden bamboo
and arrow bamboo.
BAMBOO OWNER  Any property owner or resident who has planted
and/or grows bamboo, or who maintains bamboo on the property, or who
permits bamboo to grow or remain on the property even if the bamboo has
spread from an adjoining property. Any property owner or resident at which
bamboo is found on the property will be considered a bamboo owner, except
any property owner or resident who:
BOROUGH  Borough of Glenolden, County of Delaware, Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.
Did not plant or grow or cause bamboo to be planted or grown on his
property;
A.
Has provided satisfactory proof to the Borough that, within a
reasonable period of time after discovering the encroachment of
bamboo onto the property from an adjoining or neighboring property,
he advised the owner of such property of his objection to the
encroachment of the bamboo; and
B.
Has initiated steps for the removal of the bamboo from the property,
including remedies at law.

A. Any bamboo that has been previously planted or already in existence on
any property within the Borough prior to the effective date of this
article may remain on such property, subject to the following

and abate the growth of the bamboo within 20 feet of edge of the
pavement or traveled portion of a public road in the Borough; and
(3) Each bamboo owner shall be responsible to ensure that the bamboo
planted or growing on the property prior to the effective date of
this article does not encroach or grow upon any adjoining or
neighboring property or properties, including all public property
and Borough rights-of-way; and
(4) Each bamboo owner shall be required to take such measures as are
reasonably expected to prevent bamboo planted or growing on the
property from invading, encroaching or growing onto adjoining or
neighboring properties. Such measures shall include, but not
limited to, installation of a sheathing barrier comprised of metal or
other material impenetrable by the bamboo's root system at a
sufficient depth within the property line or lines where the running
bamboo is planted or is growing to prevent the growth or

invades or grows on an adjoining or neighboring property that is owned
or held on behalf of the Borough, the Borough shall notify the bamboo
owner in writing that the bamboo has invaded the Borough property
and that the bamboo owner is responsible for the removal of such
running bamboo from the Borough property. This notice shall be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested and by regular mail to the latest
address of the bamboo owner on file with the Borough and a copy of the
notice shall also be posted at the bamboo owner's property.

floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Borough of Glenolden, classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
November 18, 2009, and September 2, 2015, and issued by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most
recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part
of the Flood Insurance Study; and
(2) Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Borough of Glenolden and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
B. The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where
average depths are between one foot and three feet. In Zones AO and
AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around
and away from structures on slopes.
C. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Borough of Glenolden has identified local flood hazard or ponding

§ 84-20. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 84-23B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 84-21. Boundary disputes.

initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 84-22. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When Borough of Glenolden proposes to permit the following
encroachments: 1) any development that causes a rise in the base flood
elevations within the floodway; or 2) any development occurring in
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will
cause a rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or 3)
alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited to
installing culverts and bridges); the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR
65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.

addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage" or "repetitive loss" regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to
residential and commercial buildings, the Code adopted the International
§ 84-39 FIREWORKS § 84-39

§ 96-2. Restriction on payment; delinquent taxes.
A. Municipal certificate required prior to payment of fire loss claims. No
insurance company, association or exchange doing business in this
commonwealth shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to
a structure located within a municipality where the amount recoverable
for the fire loss to the structure under all policies exceeds $7,500 unless

certificate pursuant to Subsection B of this section and unless there is
compliance with the procedures set forth in § 96-2B and C of this
article.
B. The Municipal Treasurer shall, upon the written request of the named
insured specifying the tax description of the property, name and
address of the insurance company, association or exchange and the
date agreed upon by the insurance company, association or exchange
and the named insured as the date of the receipt or a loss report of the
claim, furnish the insurance company, association or exchange either of
the following within 14 working days of the request:
(1) A certificate or, at the discretion of the municipality, a verbal
notification which shall be confirmed in writing by the insurer to

the property and that, as of the date of the Treasurer's certificates
or verbal notification, no municipality has certified any amount as
total costs incurred by the municipality for the removal, repair or
securing of a building or other structure on the property; or
(2) A certificate and bill showing the amount of delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties and user charges against the property as of

amount, if any, of such costs. A tax, assessment, penalty or user
charge becomes delinquent at the time and on the date a lien could
otherwise have been filed against the property by the municipality
under applicable law.
A. Receipt of certificate.
(1) Upon the receipt of a certificate pursuant to § 96-2B(1) of this
article, the insurance company, association or exchange shall pay
the claim of the named insured in accordance with the policy terms,
unless the loss agreed to between the named insured and the
company, association or exchange equals or exceeds 60% of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building
or other structure. In the case of such a loss, the insurance
company, association or exchange, the insured property owner and
the municipality shall follow the procedures set forth in
Subsections B and C of this section.
(2) Upon the receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to § 96-2B(2) of
this article, the insurance company, association or exchange shall
return the bill to the Treasurer and transfer to the Treasurer an
amount from the insurance proceeds necessary to pay the taxes,
assessments, penalties, charges and costs as shown on the bill. The
municipality shall receive the amount and apply or credit it to
payment of the items shown in the bill.
B. When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company,
association or exchange equals 60% of the aggregate limits of liability
on all fire policies covering the building or other structure, the
insurance company, association or exchange shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds to the designated officer of the municipality in the
aggregate $2,000 for each $15,000 and each fraction of that amount of
a claim, or, if at the time of a loss report the named insured has
submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure in an amount less
than the amount calculated under the foreseeing transfer formula, the
insurance company, association or exchange shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. The transfer
of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies, associations
or exchanges insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds
remaining after the transfer to the municipality shall be disbursed in
accordance with the policy terms. The named insured may submit a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or other structure after the transfer, and the
designated officer shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the
estimate to the named insured if the municipality has not commenced to
remove, repair or secure the building or other structure. This
subsection only applies to municipalities that have adopted an
ordinance authorizing the procedure described in Subsections B and C
§ 96-2 GLENOLDEN CODE § 96-3
96:276
of this section and applies only to fire losses that occur after the
adoption of the ordinance. The ordinance shall designate the officer
authorized to carry out the duties of this section.
C. Upon receipt of proceeds by the municipality as authorized by this
section, the designated officer shall place the proceeds in a separate
fund to be used solely as security against the total cost of removing,
repairing or securing incurred by the municipality. When transferring
the funds as required in Subsection B of this section, an insurance
company, association or exchange shall provide the municipality with
the name and address of the named insured, whereupon the
municipality shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds
have been received by the municipality and notify the named insured
that the procedures under this subsection shall be followed. The fund
shall be returned to the named insured when repairs, removal or
securing of the building or other structure have been completed and the
required proof received by the designated officer, if the municipality
has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing. If the
municipality has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the
building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund, and, if
excess funds remain, the municipality shall transfer the remaining
funds to the named insured. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit the ability of a municipality to recover any deficiency. Further,
nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the
municipality and the named insured from entering into an agreement
that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other
reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
D. Proof of payment by the insurance company, association or exchange of
proceeds under a policy in accordance with Subsection B of this section
is conclusive evidence of the discharge of its obligation to the insured
under the policy to the extent of the payment and of compliance by the
company, association or exchange with Subsection B of this section.
E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make an insurance
company, association or exchange liable for any amount in excess of
proceeds payable under its insurance policy or for any other act
performed pursuant to this section or to make a municipality or public
official an insured under a policy of insurance or to create an obligation
to pay delinquent property taxes or unpaid removal liens or expenses
other than as provided in this section.
F. An insurance company, association or exchange making payments of
policy proceeds under this section for delinquent taxes or structure
removal liens or removal expenses incurred by a municipality shall have
the full benefit of such payment, including all rights of subrogation and
assignment.

[Adopted 1-18-2005 by Ord. No. 2022, approved 1-18-2005]
§ 135-20. Scope and purpose.
To aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions from
contributions and accumulation of fats, oils, and grease into the sanitary
sewer system from industrial or commercial establishments, particularly
food preparation and serving facilities.
§ 135-21. Definitions.
Unless otherwise expressly stated or necessarily implied, the following
words and phrases shall be construed throughout this article to have the
meaning indicated in this section. The present tense includes the future; the
singular number includes the plural, and the plural the singular.
BOROUGH  The Borough of Glenolden, Delaware County, Pennsylvania,
or its assigned representative including the Borough Engineer or Borough
Solicitor.
FATS, OILS, AND GREASE  Organic polar compounds derived from animal
and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain tricycleride
molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using
analytical test procedures established in the United States Code of Federal
Regulations 40 CFR 136, as may be amended from time to time. All are
sometimes referred to herein as "grease."
FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS  Those establishments primarily
engaged in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available
for consumption, such as a restaurant, commercial kitchen, caterer, hotel,
school, hospital, prison, correctional facility, or care institution. These
establishments use one or more of the following preparation activities:
cooking by frying (all methods); baking (all methods); grilling; sauteing;
rotisserie cooking; broiling (all methods); boiling; blanching; roasting;
toasting; or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing,
barbequing, and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot,
nondrinkable food product in a receptacle that requires washing.
GRAB SAMPLE  A sample that is taken from a waste stream without
regard to the flow in the waste stream and over a period of time not to
exceed 15 minutes.
GREASE INTERCEPTOR  A structure or passive device designed for the
purpose of removing and preventing fats, oils, and grease from entering
the sanitary sewer collection system. These devices are often below-ground
units located outside the building and are built as two- or three-chamber
baffled tanks having a rated flow exceeding 50 gpm (189 L/m).
GREASE-LADEN WASTEWATER  Effluent discharge that is produced from
food processing, food preparation or other sources where grease, fats,
§ 135-20 SECURITY GATES § 135-21
134:351
and oils enter automatic dishwasher pre-rinse stations, sinks, or other
appurtenances.
GREASE TRAP  A passive interceptor having a rated flow 50 gpm (189L/
m) or less for separating and retaining waterborne grease and grease
complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Such traps are typically
compact under-the-sink units that are near food preparation areas and are
located inside the building.
MINIMUM DESIGN CAPABILITY  The design features of a grease
interceptor and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and
retain grease from grease-laden wastewaters discharged into the public
sanitary sewer.
SAMPLING PORT  A location in the collection system that will allow a
standardized wastewater sample to be collected.
USER  Any person or corporation, including those located outside the
corporate limits of Glenolden Borough, who contributes, causes or permits
the contribution of discharge of wastewater into sewers within the
Borough's boundaries, including persons who contribute such wastewater
from mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
§ 135-22. General requirements for wastewater discharges.
A. No user shall discharge any wastewater whose total content of oils,
waxes, and grease of mineral, petroleum, or unknown origin exceeds
100 ppm at any time as shown by grab sample, or undergoes any form
of phase separation due to temperature differentials which involve solid
or viscous substances which could impair the sewer systems of
Glenolden Borough. The Borough may reduce the above concentration
where it is demonstrated that the concentration is causing chronic or
adverse effects to the collections system.
B. No user shall discharge or allow any discharges which settle or adhere
to a collector pipe, causing a reduction of normal collector hydraulic
capacity; obstruct flow; cause premature failure and/or loss of integrity
of any component of collection and conveyance systems of the Borough;
or prevent various equipment from functioning as intended. Such
materials include but are not limited to: grease; garbage; or other bulk
solids with particles greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension; guts or
tissues; paunch; manure; bones; hair; hides or fleshing; entrails; whole
blood; blood products; feathers; ashes; cinders; sand; spent lime; paint;
stone or marble dust; metal; glass; straw; shavings; grass clippings;
rags; spent grains; spent hops; waste paper; wood; rubber; plastics;
gas; tar; asphalt residues; residues from refining or processing of fuel
or lubrication oil; mud; glass or metal filing; polishing wastes; or any
material which can be disposed of as solid waste.
C. No grease-laden sources are allowed to be connected to sewer lines
intended for grease interceptor service and under no circumstances
§ 135-21 GLENOLDEN CODE § 135-22
134:352
§ 135-23. Food service establishment permit requirements.
shall water be added to any wastewater to dilute the wastewater
concentration to acceptable levels.
D. No user shall contribute any wastewater which causes a hazard to
human life or creates a public nuisance to the wastewater system.
A. All permitted food service establishments are required to install,
operate, and maintain an approved type and adequately sized grease
interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with the objectives of this
article, as described in Subsections B, C, and D below. All grease
interceptors must meet the requirements of the International Plumbing
Code.
B. All new food service establishment facilities are subject to grease
interceptor requirements. All facilities must obtain approval from the
Borough for grease interceptor sizing prior to submitting plans for a
building permit. All grease interceptors shall be readily and easily
accessible for user cleaning and Borough inspection.
C. All existing facilities with planned plumbing improvements or
modifications in plumbing with a building permit evaluation of $20,000
or more will be required to include plans to comply with the grease
interceptor requirements. These facilities must obtain prior approval
from the Borough for grease interceptor sizing before submitting plans
for a building permit.
D. All existing food service establishments determined by the Borough to
have a reasonable potential to adversely impact the Borough's sewer
system will be notified of their obligation to install a grease interceptor
within the specified period set forth in the notification letter.
E. Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed unless
the Borough authorizes the installation of an indoor grease trap or
other alternative pretreatment technology and determines that the
installation of a grease interceptor would not be feasible. The food
service establishment bears the burden of demonstrating that the
installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible. The Borough may
authorize the installation of an indoor grease trap where the
installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible due to space
constraints or other considerations. If an establishment believes the
installation of a grease interceptor in unfeasible because of
documented space constraints, the request for an alternate grease
removal device shall contain the following information at a minimum:
(1) Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available
exterior space outside of the building.
(2) Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for all
services at that site.
§ 135-22 SECURITY GATES § 135-23
134:353
§ 135-24. Wastewater discharge limitations.
No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentrations from subject
grease interceptor, grease trap or alternative pretreatment technology to
exceed 325 mg/L, as defined by EPA Test Method 1664, or 275 mg/L, as
identified by EPA Test Method 413.
§ 135-25. Grease interceptor requirements.
F. Alternate pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to,
devices that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from
wastewater and prevent it from being discharged into the sanitary
sewer collection system. All alternative pretreatment technology must
be appropriately sized and approved by the Borough.
A. All grease interceptors must be approved by the Borough prior to
installation to ensure that the interceptor meets appropriate sizing
requirements, construction standards, and conforms to the
International Plumbing Code.
B. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with a design
approved by the Borough and shall have a minimum of two
compartments with a baffle system which adequately diverts and slows
wastewater to avoid short-circuiting. Fittings shall also be designed for

§ 148-5. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth and any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall
not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.

The tax imposed by § 148-4 shall not be imposed upon:
corporation, association or partnership and the grantee existing before
or effective with the transfer.

P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer, then the tax levied by the Borough of Glenolden under the
authority of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and
such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
the Borough of Glenolden; provided, however, that the Borough of
Glenolden and any other political subdivision which imposes such tax
on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

this article. Where the document by which title is acquired by a grantee
or statement of value fails to set forth that the property was acquired by
the grantee from, or for the benefit of, his principal, there is a

provided in this section, the true, full and complete value of the transfer
shall be shown on the statement of value. A copy of the Pennsylvania
realty transfer tax statement of value may be submitted for this
purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or minerals, the statement
of value may be limited to an explanation of the reason such document
is not subject to tax under this article.
A. A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change
does not affect the continuity of the company and, of itself or together

90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or

subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other

to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough of Glenolden or the

§ 148-60. Duty of employers to collect.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.

more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
§ 148-60 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 148-60
143A:421
§ 148-61. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 148-62. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
Each employer shall use his employment and payroll records from the
first day of January to March 31 each year for determining the number
of employees from whom said tax shall be deducted and paid over to the
collector on or before April 30 of the same calendar year. Supplemental
reports shall be made by each employer on July 30, October 30 and January
31 for new employees as reflected on his employment and payroll records
from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30 and October 1 to December
31, and payments on these supplemental reports shall be made on July 30,
October 30 and January 31, respectively.
§ 148-63. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who has earned income or realizes net profit,
as those terms are defined herein, within the political subdivision shall be

accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,

working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
§ 148-60 GLENOLDEN CODE § 148-64
143A:422
§ 148-65. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 148-66. Administration of tax.
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home. In
case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment
constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all other political
subdivisions.
A. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive payments of
this tax and keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him
from each employer or self-employed person, together with the date the
tax was received. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and keep
a record of the information submitted by employers relating to the
number of employees subject to the tax, the number of employees
exempt from the tax, the employee exemption certificates and refunds
of the tax paid to individuals and employers.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
to the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County after exhausting any
administrative remedies, as in other cases provided.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
§ 148-64 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 148-66
143A:423
§ 148-67. Suits for collection.
§ 148-68. Violations and penalties.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.

tax due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

from owners of motor vehicles for said special parking permits. The
Committee shall be comprised of three members of Borough Council, being
the Chairman of the Borough Police Committee, the Chairman of the
Borough Zoning Committee and the Chairman of the Highway Committee.
The Committee shall meet within 30 days following receipt by the Borough
Secretary of any application for a special parking permit. The Committee's
decision regarding the issuance or nonissuance of a special parking permit
shall be made in part after a consideration of the recommendations and
input of the Chief of Police and shall be final. The Committee shall meet
and discuss such applications and shall render a decision in writing within
five days after such Committee meeting. The Committee shall direct the
Borough Secretary to inform the applicant, in writing, of its decision. The
applicant shall have the right to appear before the Committee to present
his position in support of his application and to answer any questions
concerning the request for the special parking permit. All Committee
meetings shall be open to the public. Notice of such meetings shall be
posted in a prominent place in the Borough Office and mailed to each
applicant.
§ 157-32. Considerations.
The Committee shall not issue a special parking permit unless the applicant
is able to prove that he does not have adequate off-street parking for the

one special parking permit.
§ 157-33. Duration of permit; fee.

highway where there is a fire hydrant.
§ 157-36. Revocation of permit; legal actions.
If the owner of a motor vehicle who has been issued a special parking
permit violates any terms or conditions of this article, the Committee may,
after hearing, revoke such permit or direct commencement of legal action
against the special parking permit holder as provided for by this chapter.94
There will not be any return of the special parking permit fee or any portion
thereof to any special parking permit holder violating any terms of this
article.
§ 157-37. Snow emergencies.95

declares a snow emergency, then all motor vehicles parked on Borough
highways pursuant to the special parking permit must be removed at the
request of any Borough employee or of anyone authorized and directed by
the Borough to remove snow from the highways of the Borough. In the event
that the special permit holder fails to remove any vehicle during the course
of a snow emergency after being requested to do so, then the Borough shall
have the authority to direct the removal of such vehicle at the expense of
the special permit holder. The failure to remove any motor vehicle parked
on the highways of the Borough pursuant to a special parking permit shall
constitute sufficient grounds for revocation of the special parking permit.

impact on the health, safety and general welfare concerns of the
Borough of Glenolden. These associated concerns include
difficulties for law enforcement, municipal maintenance, trash,
deleterious effects on business and residential property values,
increased crime, particularly corruption of the morals of minors
and prostitution, and encourage residents and businesses to move
elsewhere.
(2) With these goals in mind, the Borough of Glenolden is amending
the Zoning Chapter to restrict or limit the location of where said
activities can locate within the bounds of the Borough of Glenolden.
The Borough of Glenolden has concluded that a permitting and/or
licensing process is a legitimate and reasonable means of
accountability to ensure that the operators of adult entertainment
uses comply with reasonable regulation and do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation. The Borough of Glenolden also does not intend by this
section to effect or suppress any activities protected by the First
Amendment but instead address these secondary effects.

ARTICLE XIII
Telecommunications Towers and Antennas
[Added 11-13-1997 by Ord. No. 1045, approved 11-13-1997]
§ 162-76. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting
of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this article
are to encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas, where
possible; minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a
primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through
careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging
techniques; enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently; consider the public health and safety of communications towers;
avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from structural failure of
the tower through engineering and careful siting of tower structures; and
permit and manage reasonable access to the public ways for
telecommunications purposes on a competitively neutral basis. In
furtherance of these goals, the Borough of Glenolden shall give due
consideration to the Borough of Glenolden's Zoning Map, existing land uses
and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the locations of
towers and antennas.

electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing
towers, buildings or structures or the antenna on the existing
towers, buildings or structures would cause interference with
the applicant's proposed antenna.
(e) The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an
existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed to be
unreasonable.
(f) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures suitable.
§ 162-82 GLENOLDEN CODE § 162-82
160:558
(g) The applicant demonstrates that an alternate technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a
cable microcell network using multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is
unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render
the technology unsuitable.
(4) Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers and antennas for which a special exception is required;
provided, however, that the Zoning Hearing Board may reduce the
standard setback requirements if the goals of this article would be
better served thereby:
(a) Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least twice the
applicable setback requirements, but in no case less than 50
feet from any adjoining lot line.
(b) Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
setback requirements.
(5) Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to
all towers and antennas for which a special exception is required;
provided, however, that the Zoning Hearing Board may reduce the
standard separation requirements if the goals of this article would
be better served thereby:
(a) Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
[1] Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the
tower to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated
areas as specified in Table 1, except as otherwise provided
in Table 1.
[2] Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards established in Table 1.

months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna
or tower shall remove the same within 90 days of receipt of notice from
the Council notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure to remove
an abandoned antenna or tower within said 90 days shall be grounds for

programming of any particular nature, directly or indirectly, and shall
not promulgate any regulation that would interfere with the right of
free speech by means of the company's provision of cable television
services.
§ A165-44 WATER § A165-47

its own attorneys about its rights and obligations regarding the
franchise. In consideration of the grant of the franchise to the company,
the company hereby waives any claim which it may have with respect to
the issuance of and/or the terms and conditions of the franchise
ordinance. In consideration of the grant of the franchise to the
company, the company also releases the Borough and any of its elected
officials, employees, representatives, agents, servants, including
attorneys, from any claims it may have, known or unknown; including,
without limitation, claims arising under Pennsylvania Law, the Cable
Act, the ordinance and Charter of the Borough of Glenolden and/or the
requirements of federal, state or municipal law, including the

any of its rights under this franchise. Upon receipt of notice in writing
from the Borough, the company shall at its own expense defend any
such actions or proceedings. Indemnified expenses shall include,
without limitation, all out-of-pocket expenses, such as reasonable
attorneys' fees; and

service mark or patent; or of any other right of any person or
corporation, excluding claims arising out of or relating to the
Borough's own programming and leased access; and
(2) Any and all claims arising out of the company's failure to comply

income, injury to reputation, or any other resulting or
consequential damages of any kind, caused by or resulting from

independently or jointly with the company, arising out of the company's
installation, construction, operation or maintenance of the cable
television system, or with any other person or municipality, the
company, upon notice given by the Borough, shall defend the Borough
at the cost of the company. If final judgment is obtained against the
Borough, either independently or jointly with the company or any other
defendants, the company shall indemnify the Borough and pay such
judgment with all costs and satisfy and discharge the same.
C. In order for the Borough to assert its rights to be indemnified, defended
or held harmless, the Borough must:
(1) Promptly notify the company of any claim or legal proceeding
which give rise to such right;
(2) The Borough shall afford the company the opportunity to
participate in and fully control any compromise, settlement or
other resolution or disposition of such claim or proceeding, unless,
however, the Borough, in its sole discretion, determines that its
interests cannot be represented in good faith by the company; and
§ A165-50 WATER § A165-50
160:589

participate in the defense of any litigation either through intervention
or otherwise. The company shall pay upon receipt of written demand
from the Borough all expenses incurred by the Borough in defending
itself with regard to any matters in this section. These expenses shall
include, but not be limited to, attorneys' fees and the reasonable value
of services (as determined by the Borough) rendered by the Borough or

immunity it may enjoy or any immunity for its agents, officials, servants,
attorneys, representatives and/or employees .

G. If the Borough awards any additional communications franchise in any
future franchise process to a firm other than the company, then the
company agrees that it will not bring, or cause to be brought, any
action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other
relief against the Borough, its elected officials, officers, boards,
commissions, employees, representatives, servants, agents or attorneys
for any award of a franchise made in conformity with this ordinance,
Pennsylvania Law, the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, Cable
Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 and the

of credit or performance bond(s), as provided for by this ordinance, are
in addition to all other rights the Borough may have under this
ordinance or any other ordinance, rule, regulation or law.
I. The Borough's exercise of or failure to exercise any rights pursuant to
any section of this ordinance shall not affect in any way the right of the
Borough subsequently to exercise any such rights or any other right of
the Borough under this ordinance or any other ordinance, rule,
regulation or law.
J. It is the purpose of this section to provide maximum indemnification to
the Borough under the terms and conditions expressed and, in the
event of a dispute, this section shall be construed (to the greatest extent
permitted by law) to provide for the indemnification of the Borough by
the company.

Sexual Harassment
[Adopted 3-16-1999 by Res. No. 3-99, approved 3-16-1999]
§ A166-11. Purpose; applicability.
§ A166-12. Policy.
§ A166-13. Definitions.
A. All employees should be able to enjoy a work environment free from all
forms of discrimination, including sexual harassment.
B. Sexual harassment is a form of misconduct that undermines the
integrity of employment relationships. No employee, either male of
female, should be subject to unsolicited and unwelcome sexual
overtures or conduct, either verbal or physical.
C. Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a
socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome,
that is personally offensive, that lowers morale and that, therefore,
interferes with work effectiveness.
A. Harassment on the basis of sex is a discriminatory practice which
violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is the policy of the
Borough of Glenolden that no person shall threaten or insinuate, either
explicitly or implicitly, that an employee's refusal to submit to sexual
advances will adversely affect the employee's employment, evaluation,
wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts or any other condition of
employment or career development.
B. It is the policy of the Borough of Glenolden that all employees are
entitled to work in an environment free from all forms of illegal
discrimination, including that which is based upon a person's sex. Aside
from being illegal, sexual harassment undermines the integrity of
individual work relationships and damages the morale of the entire
workforce. Accordingly, any practice or activity which constitutes
sexual harassment is strictly forbidden within the Borough of
Glenolden's workplaces.
A. "Sexual harassment" is defined as any repeated, deliberate, unsolicited
and unwelcome comments, gestures, conduct or physical contact of a
sexual nature.
(1) To which an employee is forced to acquiesce as a condition of the
employee's receipt of any benefit, including but not limited to
hiring, compensation, continuation of employment, promotion or
advancement; or
§ A166-11 PERSONNEL AND EMPLOYMENT POLICIES § A166-13
A166:597
§ A166-14. Procedure for filing and resolving complaints.
(2) Which has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
employee's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile
or offensive work environment.
B. Any employee who believes that he or she has been the subject of
sexual harassment should report the alleged charge immediately in
accordance with the following procedure. (All information disclosed in
the procedure will be held in strictest confidence and will only be
disclosed on a need-to-know basis in order to investigate and resolve
the matter.)
A. The individual alleging sexual harassment will report the incident to the
Borough Manager/Secretary of the Borough of Glenolden and will be
interviewed to discuss the nature of the allegations.
B. If accusations are made to any other person, the matter must be
immediately directed to the Borough Manager/Secretary of the
Borough of Glenolden. The individual alleging sexual harassment will
be informed that in order to pursue the complaint he/she must complete
a form specifically outlining the nature of the complaint. If the
complainant refuses to complete the form, the matter cannot be further
investigated by the Borough Manger/Secretary unless circumstances
clearly indicate otherwise. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the
Borough Manager/Secretary, the Solicitor and the President of the
Council are to be notified.
C. Within 48 hours after receiving the complaint in writing, the alleged
harasser will be called to the Borough Manager/Secretary, given a copy
of the completed complaint and will be informed of the seriousness of
the allegations. The Borough Manager/Secretary will review with the
alleged harasser the complete policy and indicate that a charge of
sexual harassment has been made. The alleged harasser will then have
the opportunity to refute the allegation by responding to the complaint
form.
D. The Borough Manager/Secretary will meet with the alleged harasser
and discuss the seriousness of the allegation. If the evidence warrants
it, the alleged harasser will be suspended without pay for a period not
to exceed two weeks, pending the complete investigation.
E. During the two-week suspension period, a fact-finding conference will
convene comprised of an impartial panel consisting of the Borough
Manger/Secretary of the Borough of Glenolden, the President of
Council of the Borough of Glenolden and the Solicitor. The
determination of the action to be taken will be based on the facts on a
case-by-case basis, including termination.
F. During the fact-finding conference, any investigative reports of the
Borough Manager/Secretary and/or Solicitor of the Borough of
§ A166-13 GLENOLDEN CODE § A166-14
A166:598
§ A166-15. Publication.
This policy shall be included in every employee's first paycheck. Current
employees shall sign a copy of this policy with 30 days of distribution.
Further, each new employee shall receive and sign a copy of the policy prior
to beginning employment.
Glenolden will be presented. The accused employee shall be entitled to
attend the fact-finding conference and testify in his or her own behalf
and shall be entitled to confront and cross-examine the employee who
filed the complaint. The accused employee shall also be empowered to
call witnesses in his or her own behalf and to introduce evidence which
bears upon the issues presented by the complaint and the investigative
report. Likewise, the complainant is entitled to present a list of
witnesses to testify in his or her own behalf and to introduce evidence
which bears upon the issues presented by the complaint and
investigative report.
G. The Borough Manager/Secretary and/or Solicitor will document the
allegation, findings and actions taken during the fact-finding
conference. Such documentation will be retained by the Borough
Manager/Secretary in a separate file from the normal personnel files of
the individuals involved. Should either of the parties request it, a copy
of the above documentation shall be placed in his or her personnel file.
H. If allegations prove not to constitute sexual harassment, the alleged
harasser will return to work with pay retroactive to day of suspension.
False accusations will result in severe disciplinary action up to and
including termination.
I. Both the charging party and the accused employee will be entitled to
notice of the outcome and decision of the fact-finding conference and
investigation.
J. No person filing the complaint under this executive regulation shall be
subjected to retribution for doing so unless it is discovered that such
accusations were false and may result in severe disciplinary action up
to and including termination.

§ A167-4. Objectives.
(4) Taking appropriate action if objectives are not met or if policy and
guidelines are not followed.
B. The investment manager(s) will be responsible for asset management
including the investment strategy and security section.
A. The overall objectives of the combined plan assets are:
(1) To meet all objectives for the payment of all future benefits to its
retirees, beneficiaries, and other plan participants.
(2) To enhance, as well as preserve, the plan assets.
(3) To comply with all legislation affecting these plans.
B. For competitive purposes, the Pension Board will evaluate results over
a full market cycle (generally three to five years), and these results shall
be considered relative to funds with comparable objectives. Total return
shall be measured by the performance of all assets, whether invested in
equity or fixed income securities or liquid reserves, and will include
interest as well as realized and unrealized investment gains and losses.
C. Performance objectives will include, but will not be limited to, the
following criteria:
(1) Primarily, the total return of the entire fund will be expected to
generate a premium over current actuarial assumptions.
(2) Secondarily, the United States equity portion of the account will be
expected to generate a premium over and above the S&P 500
composite index (with dividends reinvested). The United States
fixed income portion of the account will be expected to generate
returns equal to or greater than the Shearson Lehman
Intermediate Government/Corporate Bond Index.

Investment Guidelines
§ A167-5. Asset allocations
§ A167-6. Asset type.
A. Asset mix defines the distribution of assets managed by the investment
manager(s) according to the percent of the portfolio invested in equity
and fixed income securities and liquid reserves.
B. Method of allocation.
(1) The Pension Board delegates the function of day-to-day (tactical)
asset allocation to the investment manager(s) to allocate the plan
assets among equities (common stock), fixed income (bonds) and
liquid reserves (cash). In doing so, the investment manager(s)
should strive to both preserve principal and achieve long-term
appreciation of the plan assets. The Pension Board understands
that varying overall market conditions will, and should, cause the
investment manager(s) to place greater emphasis on either the
preservation of principal or capital appreciation at certain times. It
is the philosophy of the Pension Board that the following long-term
strategic asset allocation should be maintained:
(a) Police:
[1] Sixty percent equity.
[2] Forty percent fixed income.
(b) Civil:
[1] Sixty percent equity.
[2] Forty percent fixed income.
(2) The equity portion of any of the plans should not be allowed to
exceed 70% of the plan assets.
A. In order to provide the investment manager(s) with freedom to invest in
various types of assets, the following list of assets are expressly
approved:
Equity Cash Equivalents
Common stocks United States treasury bills
Convertible securities Commercial paper repurchase
agreements
Fixed Cash Equivalents
Preferred stocks Certificates of deposit
Corporate bonds Money market funds
§ A167-5 INVESTMENT POLICY § A167-6
A167:611
§ A167-7. Diversification.
In order to minimize the risk of large losses in individual security positions,
the funds will be constructed by the investment manager(s) to attain
prudent diversification in equity, fixed income and liquid reserve
investments. The following guidelines apply:
United States Government
securities
B. Assets selected for the portfolios must have a readily ascertainable
market value and must be readily marketable.
A. Equity.
(1) The manager(s) should maintain the equity portion of the portfolio
at a risk level roughly equivalent to that of the equity market as a
whole. Equity holdings may be selected from the New York,
American and Regional Stock Exchanges or the NASDAQ markets.
These holdings must represent companies meeting a minimum
capitalization requirement of $500mm with high market liquidity.
The manager(s) is prohibited from investing in private placements,
letter stock, and options (with the exception of writing covered
calls) or from engaging in short sales, margin transactions or other
specialized investment activities. It is expected that no assets will
be invested in securities whose issuers have filed a petition for
bankruptcy.
(2) The above guidelines give the manager(s) full responsibility for
security selection and diversification, subject to a maximum 10%
commitment of the funds market value for an individual security
and 20% for a particular industry. The manager(s) also will have full
discretion over turnover and the allocation of equity holdings
among selected securities and industry groups, within the limits
described above.
B. Fixed income.
(1) Investments in securities of a single issuer (with the exception of
the United States Government and its agencies) must not exceed
5% of the fund market value.
(2) Only corporate debt issues that meet or exceed a credit rating of A
from Standard & Poor's and/or an A rating from Moody's may be
purchased.
(3) Preferred stocks must be rated A or better by Moody's and/or
Standard & Poor's at the time of purchase.
(4) The manager(s) is prohibited from investing in private placements
and from speculating in fixed income or interest rate futures.
§ A167-6 GLENOLDEN CODE § A167-7
A167:612
§ A167-8. Pension fund operations.
The pension fund currently uses Legg Mason as custodian of fund assets.
The custodian provides the following services:
Within the above restrictions, the manager(s) has complete control
over the timing and selection of fixed income securities.
C. Cash and equivalents. All such assets must represent maturities of one
year or less at time of purchase. Commercial paper assets must be
rated A-1 or P-1 by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The
manager(s) may not purchase short-term financial instruments
considered to contain speculative characteristics (uncertainty of
principal and/or interest). The manager(s) may not invest more than 5%
of the plan's market value in the obligation of a single issuer, with the
exception of the United States Government and its agencies.
Uninvested cash reserves should be kept to minimum levels. Within the
limitations mentioned above, the manager(s) has complete authority to
allocate and select short-term cash and equivalent securities. It is the
general practice of the plans to keep uninvested cash in a money
market fund.
D. Other assets. The manager(s) will not purchase assets other than those
mentioned above without written consent. The manager(s) is strictly
prohibited from investing in options or futures contracts (except within
the above guidelines). Securities of foreign companies traded on
foreign stock exchanges may be purchased only with written
permission from the Pension Board. Securities of foreign companies
traded as American depository receipts (ADRs) are as permissible as
any other United States security mentioned above. Investments not
specifically addressed by this statement are forbidden without written
consent from the Pension Board. All assets must have a readily
ascertainable market value.
A. Hold all securities delivered to it, and to this end is authorized to
register them in the name of the nominee, hold them in bearer form or
book entry form or to deposit them in a depository or clearing
corporation.
B. Buy, sell, receive or deliver securities as directed.
C. Collect all income payable on the securities held by it. Dividends and
capital gains will be directly reinvested into specified mutual funds.
D. Make disbursements and pay benefits as directed.
E. Maintain a complete set of records of securities held, including all
purchases and sales thereof.
F. Prepare and distribute such other order statements as may be agreed
upon with the Pension Board.
§ A167-7 INVESTMENT POLICY § A167-9
A167:613
§ A167-9. Communications.
A. The funds expect an open and constant line of communication between
the Pension Board and Legg Mason. The frequency of the
communication between the parties is key to the appropriate
management of the fund. The Pension Board assumes the responsibility
of reporting to Legg Mason any significant changes in the assessment
of the income requirement, risk-taking capabilities or other vital
characteristics concerning the management of the fund.
B. Recognizing the dynamic nature of the underlying markets and the
securities in which the fund is investing, it will be assumed that the
responsibility of Legg Mason is to report to the Pension Board any
suggestions or alterations in these guidelines or specific contract
considerations which may be desirable for the achievement of greater
satisfactory investment results. Revisions will be considered from time
to time.
C. To aid the communications process, Legg Mason will be required to
report to the Pension Board. The reports shall include:
(1) A quarterly summary of all transactions.
(2) A quarterly statement of asset values at cost and market.
(3) Any explanation of contemplated major shifts in investment
strategy or manager style before implementation as to the fund
portfolios.
(4) An explanation of major changes in organization of the personnel
responsible for the development/management of the advisor's
investment policy and/or associated with the fund's account.
D. In addition to these written reports, Legg Mason is obligated to make
periodic personal appearances before the Pension Board.

§ A167-11. Proxy voting.
The Pension Board has chosen mutual funds for the investments of the

voting.
A. This Investment Policy Statement will be reviewed by the Pension Board
on an annual basis, but can be modified by the Pension Board at any
time.
B. Monthly, the Pension Board will be provided with a portfolio status
