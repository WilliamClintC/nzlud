other structures as may be required.
§ 151-3. Administration; records.
This building and lot numbering system shall be administered by the West
Greenwich Town Council, which shall assign building numbers to all
residential, commercial, and industrial structures and lots in conformity
with the plan developed pursuant to this chapter. The Town Council shall
also be responsible for maintaining the following official records of this

all streets facing from the point of number origin to the point of number
destination of each street.
C. Number origins.
(1) On through streets which terminate at another street at both ends,
numbers shall start at a designated common point of origin or a
designated major road.
(2) On dead-end streets or culs-de-sac, numbers will start at the
intersection of origin of the street and run toward the dead-end or
turnaround.
(3) Exceptions to either of the above shall be decided on a case-by-case
basis.
D. Common access. Where several residential or other structures are
served by a common driveway or private right-of-way which is not a
street recognized by the Town Council, the number at the entrance
shall apply to all structures served by the drive or way and each
separate structure shall be identified by a suffix letter (e.g., 115A) in
counterclockwise rotation, starting with the structure on the immediate
right of the drive or accessway.
E. Number assignment. The number assigned to each residence or
structure shall be the number which falls closest to the main entry or
driveway providing access to the property as shown on the official map
of street numbers.
A. Unacceptable street names. Numerical (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.),
alphabetical letter (A, B, C, etc.), frivolous, complicated, undesirable, or
unconventional street names are not acceptable.
B. Affixes. Unnecessary affixes are to be avoided. Terms that may be
utilized are as follows: "East," "West," "North," "South" indicating
direction; "Old," or "New" to indicate changes in differing or separate
roads.
C. Name duplication. Similar-sounding names are considered to be
duplication regardless of spelling. No duplication of names is to be
permitted within the services of a United States Post Office or local
public agencies such as a police or fire department.

ARTICLE I
Findings and Purpose
§ 305-1. Findings.
The West Greenwich Town Council finds that excessive quantities of soil
are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development for
nonagricultural uses, such as housing developments, industrial areas,
gravel removal operations, recreational facilities, commercial facilities, and
roads. This erosion makes necessary costly repairs to gullies, washed-out
fills, roads, and embankments. The resulting sediment clogs the storm
sewers and road ditches, muddies streams, leaves deposits of silt in ponds
and reservoirs, and is considered a major water pollutant.
§ 305-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation
from occurring as a result of nonagricultural development within the Town
by requiring proper provisions for water disposal and the protection of
soil surfaces during and after construction, in order to promote the safety,
public health, and general welfare of the Town.

ARTICLE III
Determining Applicability
§ 305-4. Determination of applicability required.
§ 305-5. Exceptions.
No determination of applicability is required for the following:
A. It is unlawful for any person to disturb any existing vegetation, grades,
and contours of land in a manner which may increase the potential for
soil erosion, without first applying for a determination of applicability
from the Building Official or his or her designee. Upon determination of
applicability, the owner/applicant shall submit a soil erosion and
sediment control plan for approval by the Building Official or his or her
designee, as provided in Article IV.
B. The application for determination of applicability shall describe the
location, nature, character, and time schedule of the proposed landdisturbing
activity in sufficient detail to allow the Building Official or his
or her designee to determine the potential for soil erosion and
sedimentation resulting from the proposed project. In determining the
applicability of this chapter to a particular land-disturbing activity, the
Building Official or his or her designee shall consider site topography,
drainage patterns, soils, proximity to watercourses, and other
information deemed appropriate by the Building Official or his or her
designee.
C. A particular land-disturbing activity shall not be subject to the
requirements of this chapter if the Building Official or his or her
designee finds that erosion resulting from the land-disturbing activity is
insignificant and represents no threat to adjacent properties or to the
quality of any coastal feature or watercourse, as defined in Article IX.
The current Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook, United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
Conservation Service, Rhode Island Department of Environmental
Management, and Rhode Island State Conservation Committee shall be
consulted in making this determination.
D. This chapter shall not apply to existing quarrying operations actively
engaged in excavating rock but shall apply to sand and gravel
extraction operations.
A. Construction, alteration, or use of any additions to existing singlefamily
or duplex homes or related structures; provided that the ground
coverage of the addition is less than 1,000 square feet, and
construction, alteration and use do not occur within 100 feet of any
watercourse or coastal feature, and the slopes at the site of land
disturbance do not exceed 10%.
B. Use of a home garden in association with on-site residential use.
§ 305-4 CHARTER § 305-5
C:189
C. Accepted agricultural management practices such as seasonal tilling
and harvest activities associated with property utilized for private and/
or commercial agricultural or silvicultural purposes.
D. Excavations for improvements other than those described in Subsection
A of this section which exhibit all of the following characteristics:
(1) Do not result in a total displacement of more than 2,000 cubic yards
of material;
(2) Have no slopes steeper than 10 feet vertical in 100 feet horizontal
or approximately 10%; and
(3) Have all disturbed surface areas promptly and effectively protected
to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation.
E. Grading, as a maintenance measure, or for landscaping purposes on
existing developed land parcels or lots; provided that all bare surface is
immediately seeded, sodded or otherwise protected from erosive
actions, and all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The aggregate area of activity does not exceed 2,000 square feet;
and
(2) The change of elevation does not exceed two feet at any point; and
(3) The grading does not involve a quantity of fill greater than 18 cubic
yards; except where fill is excavated from another portion of the
same parcel and the quantity does not exceed 50 cubic yards.
F. Grading, filling, removal, or excavation activities and operations
undertaken by the Town under the direction and supervision of the
Director of Public Works for work on streets, roads, or rights-of-way
dedicated to public use; provided that adequate and acceptable erosion
and sediment controls are incorporated, in engineering plans and
specifications, and employed. Appropriate controls apply during
construction as well as after the completion of these activities. All work
shall be undertaken in accordance with the performance principles
provided for in § 305-13 and the standards and definitions that may be
adopted to implement the performance principles.

for a temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunction restraining the person
from activities which would create further violations or compelling the
person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 313-17. Violations deemed public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
violation or threatened violation, including halting operations and
terminating the discharge.
B. Consent order. The Director may enter into consent orders, assurances
of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with a user. Such orders shall include specific actions to be
taken by the user and specific time frames to correct a violation or to
remove the threat of a violation. A consent order may also direct that a
user provide improved operation and maintenance of existing discharge
facilities, conduct additional self-monitoring, or submit appropriate
reports or management plans.

Tax Stabilization for Elderly Persons
[Adopted 6-14-1972 by Ord. No. 22; as amended 7-8-1992,
11-10-1993, 5-11-2005 and 10-10-2007]
§ 325-1. Authority and intent.
Pursuant to the Rhode Island Public Laws of 1972, Chapter 12, as amended
by the Rhode Island Public Laws of 1992, Chapter 41, there is hereby
enacted an ordinance for the stabilization of taxes for the elderly, as
hereinbelow set forth.
§ 325-2. Applicability.
Every person who is a citizen and legal resident of the Town of West
Greenwich, of the age of 65 years or more, and residing in the Town of
West Greenwich for seven years or more in the same dwelling house owned
by him or her, or in a dwelling house of equal or less value, which is a
constituent part of his or her real property, on a proper claim being made
therefor, shall be entitled to the stabilization of his or her tax assessment
on such real property at the then-existing rate and valuation. An exception
to the seven-year residency requirement in the same dwelling shall be
made for any person who moved to a second dwelling of equal or less
value during said seven-year period. Those persons who would otherwise
qualify but have been forced to relocate their residence within the Town of
West Greenwich due to the acquisition of their residence by the state for
reservoir purposes during said seven-year period shall also be entitled to
the benefits of this article.
§ 325-3. Restrictions.
The restriction stabilizing the tax rate and valuation on the property of
elderly persons contained in this article shall not apply to the portion of the
tax, if any, assessed by the Town for the purpose of paying the indebtedness
of the Town and the interest thereon, and for appropriation to any sinking
fund of the Town, which portion of the tax shall be paid in full.
§ 325-4. Scope and conditions; rate.
The stabilization of tax assessment shall be subject to the following
definitions and conditions:
A. When the qualified resident resides in a single-family or two-family
dwelling, the stabilized tax assessment shall apply only to the owneroccupied,
single-family dwelling and to the homesite lot on which the
dwelling is situated, along with any outbuildings on the homesite used
with the dwelling which are not additional dwellings.
(1) When the qualified resident resides in a two-family dwelling or an
elderly and/or handicapped family apartment, the stabilized tax
assessment shall apply only to the value of the owner-occupied
§ 325-1 CHARTER § 325-4
C:235
dwelling or apartment and not to the value of the dwelling to which
it is attached or the homesite lot on which it is located.
(2) The homesite lot shall be a single parcel of land that is shown on
the Tax Assessor plat map with a single plat and lot number (except
that a vacant lot of less than two acres, which is contiguous to the
homesite lot, may be joined to the homesite lot and shall qualify for
stabilized tax assessment, provided the lots so joined are therefore
shown on the Tax Assessor plat map as a single homesite lot). A
land parcel of two or more acres with an assigned plat and/or lot
number different from the homesite plat and lot number, whether
contiguous or noncontiguous to the homesite lot, shall not have
stabilized tax assessment.
B. The term "legal resident," as used in this article, shall mean a person
who is eligible to become a qualified elector in the Town of West
Greenwich, and who resides and has resided in the Town of West
Greenwich in the same dwelling, owned by him or her, for the preceding
seven or more years, that being the dwelling identified on the
application for stabilized taxes. No person who is not a legal resident of
the Town shall be entitled to stabilized taxes.
C. The stabilized tax assessment as provided in this article shall apply to
jointly owned property if any of the joint tenants meets the applicant
qualifications. The stabilized tax assessment benefit shall be in addition
to any exemptions to which any of these tenants may be entitled.
(1) In the case of property held jointly by husband and wife, the
property, if otherwise eligible for stabilization, shall not be
disallowed upon the grounds that one spouse is not 65 years or
older or has not resided in West Greenwich for the required seven
years.
(2) A stabilization under this section shall not be disallowed if the
owner-occupant has only a life estate in the property or if the
property is in the name of a parent or one or more children or a
living trust for the benefit of the otherwise qualified resident and
the owners submit an affidavit that the qualified resident is
principal owner or present beneficiary and title is held in that
manner for estate planning purposes only.
D. The stabilized tax assessment shall terminate upon conveyance of the
stabilized property, or upon the death of the qualified applicant, or
failure of the qualified applicant to file an annual declaration of
eligibility statement. In the case of death, a surviving spouse who meets
the applicant requirements and who files a proper application shall
have his or her taxes stabilized at the assessment in effect at the time of
death pursuant to the terms of Subsection H.
E. The stabilized assessment shall be identified with an account number
separate from that assigned to any other buildings and/or land in excess
of the homesite. The Tax Assessor shall stabilize the assessment at the
§ 325-4 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 325-4
C:236
§ 325-5. Qualification procedure.
No person shall be entitled to the stabilized tax assessment as provided
in this article unless he or she has filed a proper application with the Tax
Assessor and has met all the requirements thereof. The application form
shall be provided by the Tax Assessor's office and shall elicit the following
information:
rate and valuation in effect at the date of application, if approved. Any
additions to the dwelling and/or outbuildings which do not exceed 10%
of the stabilized value within any three-year period shall remain under
the stabilized tax assessment. Improvements that exceed 10% in value
over any three-year period shall be taxed each year thereafter at the
current rate and valuation.
F. Any stabilized tax assessment effected by the Tax Assessor shall not
apply to any decrease in tax assessment below the assessment so
stabilized. However, only the rate and valuation that are applicable to a
given tax year shall be used in combination to compute any decreased
assessment. In such instance, the lower assessment shall apply. Appeal
from any Tax Assessor determinations concerning eligibility or
interpretation of the provisions of this article shall be directed to the
Tax Board of Review of the Town of West Greenwich.
G. The tax rate and valuation on a single-family dwelling or a two-family
dwelling owned and occupied as their domicile by a person who has
attained age 65 years, regardless of income, shall be fixed at the tax
rate and valuation applicable to such property for the December 31
assessment date immediately following the date on which such person
meets the requirements of this article.
H. A surviving spouse will be entitled to a twenty-four-month transition
period from the date of death before the property is removed from
stabilization. If a surviving spouse reaches the age of 65 during those
24 months, tax stabilization shall remain in place. If the surviving
spouse does not reach the age of 65 during those 24 months, the
stabilization is removed and the current assessment and tax rate shall
be applied.
A. The name and legal address of applicant.
B. The applicant's date of birth.
C. The plat and lot number as shown on the Tax Assessor's plat map, which
shall identify the property for stabilized tax assessment.

read and do understand the provisions and limitations set forth in this
article under which I am applying for stabilized tax assessment, and I
declare by signature that I am a legal resident of the Town of West

taxes. All residents who qualified prior to the effective date of this
amendment shall comply with the provisions of § 325-5I of this article.
Greenwich and I am eligible for the stabilized tax assessment ordained
by this article."
F. Following the declaration of eligibility, there shall appear the
applicant's notarized signature and date.
G. All new applicants shall submit to an inspection of the stabilized
property by the Tax Assessor's office before final approval.
H. The Tax Assessor's final approval.
I. Additionally, the application form shall state that after the initial
application and approval of stabilized tax assessment status, the above
qualified applicant shall file with the Tax Assessor a "continuation of
eligibility" statement for each tax year that the stabilized tax
assessment is claimed. On the statement, the applicant shall verify that
he or she is a citizen and legal resident of the Town of West Greenwich
and still owns and resides at the stabilized property. The renewal
statement form shall be provided by the Tax Assessor and shall be filed
prior to March 31 of each year. Failure of the qualified applicant to file
the continuation of eligibility statement shall terminate the stabilized
tax assessment status for the year.
J. Proof of age, ownership and domicile shall be presented to the Tax
Assessor at the time of application. The documents of verification, along
with the application, shall be filed in the Tax Assessor's office, and a

ARTICLE VI
Tax Stabilization for Industrial, Manufacturing and Commercial
Facilities
[Adopted 11-6-2013 by Ord. No. 95]
§ 325-18. Authority.
The Town Council has the authority under R.I.G.L. § 44-3-9.8 to exempt from
tax payment, in whole or in part, real and personal property which is used
for manufacturing or commercial purposes, or to determine a stabilized
amount of taxes to be paid on account of the property, notwithstanding the
valuation of the property or the tax rate.
§ 325-19. Purpose.
In order for the Town to grow economically, it must support the
rehabilitation, reuse and expansion of existing commercial and industrial
buildings, as well as incentivize new construction on vacant/unused space,
in order to return them to productive use. The purpose of this article is to
provide the Town with a tool to promote and encourage the use of vacant
space through new construction and development and the expansion,
relocation, or renovation of industrial, commercial and manufacturing
facilities in the Town through tax stabilization with the goal of continuing
the Town's revitalization and promoting job creation. The high cost of
rehabilitating, developing and/or remediating these buildings or parcels for
productive use is prohibitively expensive and cannot be achieved without
both private and public investment. It is therefore in the public interest to
provide property tax incentives for owners of qualifying properties in order
that there may be substantial redevelopment of the properties for industrial,
manufacturing and commercial uses, and the commercial portion of mixeduse
developments. This will result in the willingness of a manufacturing
or commercial concern to locate in the Town; the willingness of a
manufacturing firm to expand with an increase in employment or the
willingness of a commercial or manufacturing concern to retain or expand
its facility in the Town and not reduce its workforce in the Town; an
improvement of the physical plant of the Town that will result in long-term
economic growth and benefits to the Town and the state; or granting of the
exemption or stabilization of taxes will inure to the benefit of the Town by
reason of the willingness of a manufacturing or commercial firm or concern
to replace, reconstruct, expand or remodel existing buildings, facilities,
fixtures, machines, or equipment with modern buildings, facilities, fixtures,
machines, or equipment, resulting in an increase in plant or commercial
building investments by the firm or concern in the Town.
§ 325-20. Eligibility.
A. For a property to be eligible for this tax stabilization program, the
subject property must either:
§ 325-18 CHARTER § 325-20
C:247
(1) Be in need of substantial rehabilitation and/or new construction
and/or vacant for a period of 12 months. For the purposes of this
article, "substantial rehabilitation and/or new construction and/or
vacant for a period of 12 months" shall mean rehabilitation and/or
new construction and/or a purchase price of vacant property that
adheres to the applicable building and fire codes and the cost of
which is greater than or equal to $250,000, and equal to at least
25% of the then-current assessed value (as assessed by the Town).
Owners of existing industrial, commercial or manufacturing
buildings, as well as owners of vacant property upon which new
construction of industrial, commercial or manufacturing buildings
is to be conducted, are eligible to apply for relief under this section.
Owners of eligible properties must begin construction or
rehabilitation within 12 months of the execution of the subject
stabilization agreement, and obtain a certificate of occupancy for
such construction or rehabilitation within 36 months of
commencement. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, a
temporary certificate of occupancy shall suffice. Owners of
properties that fail to meet these deadlines will be required
retroactively to pay the difference between their actual stabilized
tax payments and what they would have paid if ineligible for the
specified tax considerations (unless granted an extension of such
applicable deadline due to events of force majeure, as determined
by the Town Council); or
(2) Be a property upon which new construction or rehabilitation of, or
which has been vacant for 12 months or more, a nonresidential
industrial, commercial or manufacturing facility has been
completed or occupied after January 1, 2011, but prior to the
passage of this article, that would otherwise be eligible to apply for
tax stabilization under the provisions of this article; provided,
however, in order to qualify for tax stabilization under this
Subsection A(2), the costs for substantial rehabilitation and/or new
construction and/or the purchase price of vacant property shall
have been at least $500,000. Applicants under this subsection must
present a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy along
with the application for tax stabilization. The date of issuance of the
temporary (if issued) or permanent certificate of occupancy shall
serve as the completion date for the purpose of determining
eligibility under this subsection. Any tax stabilization applied for
under this section shall be effective commencing with the year in
which the application is accepted and approved by the Town
Council.
B. As set forth in § 325-22 below, the Tax Assessor shall process
applications made under this article. To qualify for tax stabilization
under this article, whether applying pursuant to Subsection A(1) or (2)
above, the Tax Collector must certify that the applicant and its affiliates
owning property in the Town are current with regard to all taxes and
assessments due and payable to the Town. The Tax Assessor will

§ 325-21. Conditions.
Tax stabilizations for eligible properties shall run with the land and be
transferable to new owners or tenants, but the duration of the tax
consideration period shall not be extended (unless otherwise approved
by the Town Council). If the applicant (or the successor fee owner of a
property subject to a stabilization agreement granted hereunder) defaults
on any quarterly tax or other payment due and payable to the Town (i.e.,
real estate, motor vehicle, or personal property) that is not the subject
of a lawful and unresolved appeal process, the Town Council may, after a
thirty-day notice and cure period, order the subject stabilization agreement
to be terminated. In the event that the Town Council shall terminate a
stabilization agreement for such failure to pay taxes (after applicable notice
and cure periods), the applicant (or then-current owner, if the applicant
is no longer the fee owner) shall thereafter be required to repay all of
the taxes which it did not pay as a result of the stabilization agreement
granted under this article. The applicant, on its behalf and the behalf
of its successors and assigns, shall agree in the applicable stabilization
agreement to permit the Town to place a lien against the subject property
immediately following any such termination by the Town Council for all such
unpaid amounts. Furthermore, the tax stabilization shall cease immediately
upon the vacating of the property or if the nonresidential industrial,
commercial or manufacturing facility ceases operation; and if the property
is vacated or operations cease within five years after the stabilization was
granted, the applicant shall owe the Town all of the taxes, and interest
thereon, which it did not pay as a result of the tax stabilization granted
under this article. The applicant, its successors and assigns agree to allow
the Town to place an annual lien against the property which is benefitting
concurrently confirm the then-current pre-construction assessed value
of the building at the time of application (based on the applicable
assessment at the time). To qualify for tax stabilization under
Subsection A(2) of this section, the Building Official for the Town must
confirm that there are no outstanding notices of violation with respect
to the subject property.
C. Projects consisting of multiple buildings on one lot or multiple buildings
on adjacent lots can be consolidated and treated as one project for the
purposes of this article and the requirements hereof. For the purposes
of this article, a project involving multiple buildings on one lot shall be
deemed "completed" as of the date of issuance of the final building
certificate of occupancy. Projects involving residential buildings are not
eligible to apply for tax stabilization under this article.
D. Costs that qualify for the thresholds set forth above shall be limited to
hard construction costs and materials, architectural fees, engineering
fees, and legal fees, and shall exclude developer fees or other similar
fees paid to applicants or their affiliates. The foregoing shall be
confirmed by the Building Official in connection with its processing of
each application.

is vacant or operations cease during the first five years after tax
stabilization is in effect on the property.
§ 325-22. Procedure.
Any owner of an industrial, commercial and manufacturing facility or vacant
parcel may apply for tax stabilization at the office of the Tax Assessor. The
Town Administrator, together with the Town Tax Assessor, shall develop
forms and additional procedures consistent with this article, as deemed
necessary and proper to effectuate their respective obligations under terms
and provisions contained herein. The procedure for eligible properties
under this article shall be as follows:
A. No person shall be entitled to any exemption herein authorized without
first filing an application for tax stabilization at the office of the Tax
Assessor. No application shall be considered unless:
(1) The application is filed prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy (or temporary certificate of occupancy), unless the
applicant is applying under § 325-20A(2) of this article, in which
case a certificate of occupancy (or temporary certificate of
occupancy) should be filed with the application;
(2) The applicant certifies that the project will involve "substantial
construction or rehabilitation" (as defined in this article) of an
eligible property; and
(3) A nonrefundable application fee in the amount of 0.1% of the
estimated cost of the project is paid to the Town.
B. Within 15 days of receipt of a completed application (together with the
application fee), the Tax Assessor shall forward a copy of such
application to the Town Building Official and the Town Council. The
Town Council shall review the application and direct the appropriate
Town departments to conduct required due diligence. All due diligence
must be completed within 45 days of the application's submission to the
Tax Assessor.
C. If the Town Building Official reports a violation of the Town Building
Code with respect to subject property, said violations shall be reported
to the Town Council and notice shall be given to the applicant within 30
days. No tax stabilization agreement shall be issued unless and until
any and all such violations have been cured, or unless the plans for such
project establish that such violation will be cured in connection with
such work (and such stabilization agreement shall state that such work
shall be a condition of such agreement continuing). With respect to
projects applying under § 325-20A(2) of this article, the applicant shall
have 60 days from the date of said notice to cure any outstanding
violations or other matters which serve as a valid basis for the Building
Official not approving the application. Failure to cure shall result in a

D. If the Tax Collector reports that an applicant owes taxes to the Town
with respect to the property to which the tax stabilization agreement
would apply, notice shall be given to the Town Council and the applicant
within 30 days. The applicant shall have 30 days to make the required
tax payment(s). Failure by the applicant to cure any tax deficiencies
associated with the subject property shall result in cancellation of the
application as an incomplete application (unless an extension is granted
by the Town Council) without a prejudicial effect as to the ability of the
applicant to reapply.
E. Any tax stabilization authorization may require an increase in quality
employment proportionate to the increase in facility size or such
increase in employment as determined by the Town Council.
F. The Town council shall review each application and, if all eligibility
requirements established in this section are satisfied, may enter into a
tax stabilization agreement with the applicant.
A. Tax stabilization guidelines for expansions of an existing facility or new
facility construction or renovation work greater than or equal to 25% of

an applicant regarding any statements or representations contained in the
application or the materials provided therewith.
§ 325-26. Limitation on number of projects issued exemption;
incomplete applications.
The number of tax stabilization agreements issued under in connection
with this article shall be limited to five. Applications shall be considered
on a first come, first served basis (considering only those applications
that are deemed complete by the Town Council). The Tax Assessor shall
keep a list of all applications filed, and shall remove applications that are
deemed incomplete by the Town Council. Upon removal of an incomplete
application, the Tax Assessor shall provide the applicant with notice of
A. If the cost of expansion of an existing facility or construction of a new
facility or renovation work is over $500,000, the effect of the tax
stabilization shall be to exempt from taxation, according to the
guidelines set forth herein, a percent of the increase in value over the
assessed value of the property prior to the commencement of
substantial rehabilitation and/or new construction. The following tax
stabilization guidelines shall apply to applicants who meet the criteria

C:272
providing a sufficient supply of water for the proposed use. The yield test
will be conducted at a constant flow rate for the duration of the test.
Requirements supplemental to existing state requirements are discussed
below.
A. Accounting for effective storage capacity of well. To ensure a domestic
well is capable of producing the RIDEM enforceable required well yield,
the removal of the effective storage capacity of the well shall be
incorporated into the yield test. To incorporate the effective storage
capacity of a six-inch-diameter well into the yield test, the formulas
detailed below shall be utilized. If a well owner or installer proposes to
construct a domestic well with a diameter other than six inches in size,
the following formulas shall be revised by the Town's consultant on a
case-by-case basis. A well owner or installer proposing to install a well
with a diameter other than six inches shall submit a written request to
the Town identifying the specific proposed well construction details.
The Town's consultant shall then provide revised formulas to determine
the well installation and testing requirements.
(1) Determine the required RIDEM well yield. The RIDEM required
well yield, as documented in the Water Well Regulations as may be
amended from time to time. For example:
(a) With a yield of five gallons per minute a minimum well depth of
100 feet is required.
(b) With a yield of 3.5 gallons per minute a minimum well depth of
150 feet is required.
(c) With a yield of two gallons per minute a minimum well depth of
200 feet is required.
(d) With a yield of one gallon per minute a minimum well depth of
300 feet is required.
(e) With a yield of 0.5 gallon per minute a minimum well depth of
450 feet is required.
*Note: the preceding requirements were developed by RIDEM
based upon a six-inch-diameter well with a static depth to
water level of 25 feet to 35 feet below the ground surface.
(2) Determine the effective storage capacity.
(Depth to top of pump (feet) - Measured depth to water (feet)) =
Effective Well Depth (feet)
Effective Well Depth (feet) x 1.5
(gallons/feet) = Effective Storage Capacity
(gallons)
(3) Determine the required constant pump rate to be pumped from the
well during the yield test:

Rate (gpm)
* Five-hour minimum
The required constant pump rate shall be pumped from the well
for the duration of the yield test.
B. Location of discharge line. The pump discharge line shall be located so
as to eliminate recirculation of pumped water during the yield test. The
discharge point for water pumped during yield tests shall be located at
least 50 feet away and topographically lower than the production well.
C. Collection of depth-to-water measurements.
(1) Depth-to-water measurements, accurate to within 1/10 of one foot,
shall be collected at key points during the yield test. Key points
include immediately prior and subsequent to the start of the yield
test, immediately prior and subsequent to the finish of the yield
test, and at a minimum every one-half hour during the yield test.
(2) Sufficient depth-to-water measurements shall also be collected to
demonstrate compliance with the recovery requirement discussed
in Subsection D below.
D. Recovery requirement.
(1) For wells with an effective well depth of 450 feet or less, the well
owner shall demonstrate that the water level in the well has
recovered to at least 85% of the static water level (water level
measured prior to commencement of the yield test) within 18 hours
of the end of the yield test. To demonstrate compliance with the
recovery requirement, one water level measurement documenting
a minimum of 85% recovery shall be collected no more than 18
hours after to demonstrate compliance with this requirement:
Effective Well Depth@ <18th hour
Effective Well DepthStatic
x 100 > 85
(2) For wells with an effective well depth greater than 450 feet, the
well owner shall demonstrate that the well recovers to 85% of the
static water level, as detailed above, or that the well recovers at a
rate of 20 feet per hour for a period of 18 hours. To demonstrate
compliance with the recovery requirement, one water level
measurement collected immediately after the end of the yield test
§ 378-8 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 378-8
C:274
§ 378-9. Inspections.
The Town's consultant may perform unannounced spot inspections during
the yield test. During inspections, the Town's consultant may observe the
yield testing procedures, discharge location, well location, well depth, and
pumping rate, or any other aspect of the well construction or testing
procedure deemed relevant by the consultant to verify compliance with
RIDEM and Town regulations. The latitude and longitude of the well may
also be recorded through the use of a handheld global positioning system
(GPS) unit, or other acceptable means.
§ 378-10. RIDEM well completion report.
The RIDEM well completion report shall be completed and received by
RIDEM and the Town Building Official within 15 business days of
completion of the yield test. The well completion report shall be reviewed
by the Town's consultant to assess the accuracy, completeness, and
acceptability of the well construction and yield test, and the ability of the
well to provide a sufficient water supply to meet the intended use of the
property. Issuance of a building permit from the Town Building Official shall
be dependent upon submission and approval of the well completion report
by the Town and the Town's consultant.
§ 378-11. Town well completion form.
In addition to the RIDEM well completion report, the well owner shall
complete the Town of West Greenwich well completion form. The Town well
completion form shall be completed and received by the Town Building
Official within 15 business days of completion of the yield test. The Town
well completion form shall be reviewed by the Town's consultant to assess
the accuracy, completeness, and acceptability of the well construction and
yield test. Issuance of a building permit from the Town Building Official shall
shall be compared to a water level measurement collected no less
than 12 hours and no more than 18 hours after the end of the
yield test. The following formula shall be used to demonstrate
compliance with this requirement:
Effective Well Depth@ # Hour - Effective Well Depth@
end of yield test
# Hours
> 20 feet
Note: # Hour = The number of hours between the end of yield
test and the final water level measurement (must be between 12
and 18 to ensure that the average recovery rate of the well is not
skewed by rapid recovery immediately following the completion of
the yield test).
§ 378-8 CHARTER § 378-11
C:275
be dependent upon submission and approval of the Town well completion
form by the Town and the Town's consultant.
§ 378-12. Additional requirements.
The Town reserves the right to request additional testing or assessment
of any well if any of the RIDEM or Town requirements have not been met
to the satisfaction of the Town or the Town's consultant. Incomplete or
otherwise deficient well completion reports or questionable yield testing
results or construction details may warrant a request for additional testing
or assessment.
§ 378-13. Emergency provisions.
Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the emergency drilling of a drinking
water well for a homeowner or tenant on an interim basis in the event
a residence loses its water supply. If a well is drilled and installed under
this provision, then the homeowner or tenant shall notify the Town Building
Official no later than the next business day and will comply with all other
provisions of §§ 378-4 through 378-12 of this chapter as soon as possible.

§ 400-10. Variances.
Relief from literal requirements of this chapter because of hardship may be
granted to any person, group, agency or corporation through the issuance
of a variance by the Zoning Board of Review under the procedures herein.
Two types of variances can be considered as described below: a use
variance and a dimensional variance.
special use permit is made. Notice shall be given in accordance with
§ 400-11, and a hearing shall be held on the request. [Added
6-12-2019]
G. Pendency of court actions. None of the above one-year periods shall run
during the pendency of any Superior Court actions seeking to overturn
the grant. [Added 6-12-2019]
A. Variance application. An application for relief from the literal
requirements of this chapter because of hardship may be made by any
person, group, agency, or corporation by filing with the Town Clerk, and
Clerk of the Zoning Board of Review, an application describing the
variance request and supported by plans and data describing the site
and proposed use and documentation in support of the application. The
application shall show the location and dimensions of the property and
the proposed use and any other information required by the application
form and as may be required by the Zoning Board of Review.
B. General standards for granting a variance. In granting either use or
dimensional variances, the Zoning Board of Review shall require that
evidence to the satisfaction of the following standards be entered into
the record of the proceedings:
(1) That the hardship from which the applicant seeks relief is due to
the unique characteristics of the subject land or structure and not
to the general characteristics of the surrounding area; and is not
due to a physical or economic disability of the applicant, excepting
those physical disabilities addressed in R.I.G.L. § 45-24-30(16);
[Amended 7-11-2018]
(2) That the hardship is not the result of any prior action of the
applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the
applicant to realize greater financial gain;
(3) That the granting of the requested variance will not alter the
general character of the surrounding area or impair the intent or
purpose of this chapter or the Comprehensive Plan upon which this
chapter is based; and
(4) That the relief to be granted is the least relief necessary.
C. Standards for granting a use variance. The Zoning Board of Review
shall, in addition to the above standards, require that evidence be
entered onto the record of the proceedings showing that in granting a
§ 400-9 CHARTER § 400-10
C:291
§ 400-11. Procedure for appeal, variance or special use permit.
use variance the subject land or structure cannot yield any beneficial
use if it is required to conform to the provisions of this chapter.
Nonconforming use of neighboring land or structures in the same
district and permitted use of lands or structures in an adjacent district
shall not be considered in granting a use variance.
D. Standards for granting a dimensional variance. In granting a
dimensional variance, the hardship that will be suffered by the owner of
the subject property if the dimensional variance is not granted shall
amount to more than a mere inconvenience. The fact that a use may be
more profitable or that a structure may be more valuable after the relief
is granted shall not be grounds for relief. The Zoning Board of Review
has the power to grant dimensional variances where the use is
permitted by special use permit if provided for in the special use permit
sections of this chapter. [Amended 7-11-2018]
E. Expiration. A variance shall expire one year after the date of approval
by the Board, unless a building permit is obtained or a certificate of
occupancy is obtained when no building permit is required. [Amended
6-12-2019]
F. One-year extension. If application is made prior to the expiration of the
initial one-year period, the Board may, upon written request and for
cause shown, renew the variance for a second one-year period. Said
request for an extension need not be advertised nor noticed. An
advisory opinion from the Planning Board shall not be required. [Added
6-12-2019]
G. Further extension for cause. Should a building permit not be obtained
or a certificate of occupancy for a nonpermit project not be issued
within the second one-year period, the Board may, upon written request
filed prior to expiration, renew the variance for a third one-year period,
provided that the applicant can demonstrate due diligence in
proceeding and substantial financial commitment in promoting the
subject of the variance. Notice shall be given in accordance with
§ 400-11, and a hearing shall be held on the request. [Added
6-12-2019]
H. Pendency of court actions. None of the above one-year periods shall run
during the pendency of any Superior Court actions seeking to overturn
the grant. [Added 6-12-2019]
A. The Zoning Board of Review, upon receipt of an application for an

of the application. If the subject property is located within 200 feet of
the Town line, a notice shall be sent to the Town Clerk and Planning
Board of the neighboring city or town. In addition, all property owners
within 200 feet of the subject property located in the neighboring
community shall be notified, the list of which is to be certified by the
neighboring city/town tax assessor's office.
D. The notice shall also include the street address of the subject property.
The cost of notification shall be borne by the applicant. This cost shall
be waived for any application submitted on behalf of any Town agency.
E. Any party may appear at the public hearing in person or be represented
by agent or by attorney.
A. In granting a variance or special use permit or in making any
determination upon which it is required to pass after a public hearing
under this chapter, the Zoning Board of Review may apply such special
conditions that may, in the opinion of the Board, be required to promote
the intent and purposes of the Comprehensive Plan and this chapter.
B. Failure to abide by any special conditions shall constitute a zoning
violation.
C. Those special conditions shall be based on competent, credible
evidence on the record, be incorporated into the decision, and may
include, but are not limited to, provisions for:

text, maps, illustrations or other media of communication, that is designed
to provide a basis for rational decision-making regarding the long-term
physical development of the district.
A. The purpose of the Exit 7 Special Management District ("SMD") is to
establish design, density and dimensional criteria for a large-scale
commercial development in the area located at Exit 7 along Interstate
Route 95. It is the intent of this article to allow for a multi-year phased
development that promotes high-quality design, provides employment
opportunities and expands the Town's commercial tax base.
B. The purpose of the SMD is to provide an area for economic
development in the community according to prescribed review and
approval procedures, and according to design standards particular to
the SMD. The SMD is intended to provide for a diversity of compatible
land uses and development densities, which will include a mixture of
retail sales, office, restaurant and hotel uses.

§ 400-99. General criteria and standards.
In addition to the requirements of Chapter 450, Land Development and
Subdivision Regulations, the following criteria and standards shall be used
by the Planning Board in reviewing applications for development plan
approval. They are intended to provide a framework within which the
designer of the site development is free to exercise creativity, invention
and innovation. Participation by the Planning Board shall be restricted to
reasonable, professional review and, except as otherwise provided in the
following subsections, full responsibility for design shall be retained by the
applicant.
A. Ecological considerations. The development shall:
(1) Result in minimal degradation of unique or irreplaceable land
types; minimal adverse impact upon the critical areas such as
streams, wetlands, areas of aquifer recharge and discharge, steep
slopes, highly erodible soils; areas with a high water table, mature
stands of vegetation and extraordinary wildlife nesting, feeding or
breeding grounds.
(2) Conform with existing geological and topographic features so that
the most appropriate use of land is encouraged.
B. Landscape. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state,
insofar as environmentally desirable, by minimizing tree and soil
removal. If development of the site necessitates the removal of
established trees, special attention shall be given to the planting of
replacements or to other landscape treatment. Any grade changes shall
be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed
areas. A minimum of 15% of all sites shall be landscaped. Refer to
Chapter 450, Land Development and Subdivision Regulations, for
specific requirements.
C. Relationship of proposed structures to environment.
(1) Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to each other,
the terrain, existing buildings, and roads in the vicinity that have a
visual relationship to the proposed structures.
(2) Proposed structures shall be so sited as to minimize adverse impact
upon the surrounding area, and particularly upon any nearby
residences, by reason of:
(a) Building location, height, bulk and shadows;
(b) Location, intensity, direction and times of use of outdoor
lighting;
(c) Traffic generation, noise generation and pollution;
(d) Likelihood of nuisances; and
§ 400-99 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 400-99
C:354
(e) Other similar considerations.
(3) Appropriate natural or artificial screening may be required to
minimize any such adverse impact.
D. Scenic, historic, archaeological landmark sites. Scenic, historical,
archaeological landmark sites and features that are located on or
adjacent to the proposed development shall be preserved and
protected. In proposed developments where such sites have been
identified, advisory opinions shall be sought from appropriate state and
local agencies.
E. Surface water drainage. A proposed development shall be designed so
as to provide for proper surface water management through a system of
controlled drainage that:
(1) Preserves existing natural drainage patterns and wetlands;
(2) Enhances groundwater recharge areas; and
(3) Protects other properties and existing natural and artificial
drainage features from the adverse effects of flooding, erosion and
the depositing of silt, gravel or stone.
F. Driveway connection to public streets.
(1) All entrance and exit driveways to public streets shall be located
with due consideration for traffic flow and so as to afford maximum
safety to traffic on the public streets. Roadway design shall
conform to Town and State of Rhode Island Department of
Transportation standards (Standards Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction), as appropriate. All such entrances and exits
shall be located and designed to:
(a) Conform with municipal sight distance requirements at corner
lots and in accordance with the Rhode Island Department of
Transportation standards;
(b) Achieve maximum practicable distance from street
intersections, from existing and proposed access connections
and from adjacent properties;
(c) Minimize left-hand turns and other turning movements; and
(d) Discourage the routing of vehicular traffic to and through local
residential streets.
(2) Each lot shall be limited to one driveway per street frontage, and
any lots created from the original lot shall be served by the single
driveway or curb opening. A second curb cut may be approved by
the Planning Board as part of the plan approval, if the Board finds
that the additional curb cut is necessary and would improve traffic
§ 400-99 CHARTER § 400-99
C:355
flow on the main road, or is otherwise required by the Fire Chief
for that district for emergency access.
(3) It is encouraged, and the Planning Board may require, that internal
driveway and/or pedestrian connections are made between
abutting commercial sites.
(4) To the extent feasible, access to businesses shall be provided via
one of the following:
(a) Access via a common driveway serving adjacent lots or
premises;
(b) Access via an existing side street where deemed appropriate;
(c) Access via a cul-de-sac or loop road shared by adjacent
premises.
G. Traffic effects. The site development proposal generally shall minimize
adverse traffic effects on the road networks serving the area in
question. A traffic study may be required to document the existing
conditions and the potential impact of the proposed development.
H. Pedestrian safety. Pedestrian and bicycle circulation shall be separated
from motor vehicle circulation; safe and convenient pedestrian
circulation, including sidewalks, where appropriate, shall be provided
on the site and its approaches. The pedestrian circulation plan shall be
designed to minimize potential conflicts between vehicles, bicycles and

necessary to provide for shade and for screening of unsightly or
highly trafficked areas from public rights-of-way or adjacent uses.
Additional perimeter screening and other buffer areas may be
required.
(3) The location of parking areas shall not detract from the design of
proposed buildings and structures or from the appearance of the
existing neighboring buildings, structures and landscape. Provision
shall be made for access by police, fire and emergency vehicles.

§ 400-153. Application and review procedures.
Application and review procedures shall be set forth in Chapter 450, Land
Development and Subdivision Regulations.
§ 400-154. Criteria for approval.
In approving an application for a comprehensive permit, the local review
board shall make positive findings, supported by legally competent evidence
on the record which discloses the nature and character of the observations
upon which the fact finders acted, on each of the following standard
provisions, where applicable:
A. Any applicant proposing to build low- or moderate-income housing may
submit to the local review board a single application for a
comprehensive permit to build that housing in lieu of separate
applications to the applicable local boards. This procedure is only
available for proposals in which at least 25% of the housing is low- or
moderate-income housing.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with R.I.G.L.
§ 45-53-4(a)(4)(xii), the West Greenwich Town Council limits the annual
total number of dwelling units in comprehensive permit applications
from nonprofit developers to an aggregate of 1% of the total number of
year-round housing units in the Town, as recognized in the affordable
housing plan. This provision shall not become effective until the Town

C. Notwithstanding the timetables set forth elsewhere in this article, the
local review board shall have the authority to consider comprehensive
permit applications from for-profit developers, which are made
pursuant to this section, sequentially in the order in which they are
submitted. This provision shall not become effective until the Town
receives state approval of its locally adopted affordable housing plan.
A. The proposed development is consistent with local needs as identified
in the local comprehensive community plan, with particular emphasis
on the community's affordable housing plan, and/or has satisfactorily
addressed the issues where there may be inconsistencies.
B. The proposed development is in compliance with the standards and
provisions of the municipality's zoning ordinance and subdivision
regulations, and/or where expressly varied or waived local concerns
48.Editor's Note: The definition of "low- or moderate-income housing," which immediately
followed this definition, was repealed at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I). See the definition in § 400-4 of this chapter.

that have been affected by the relief granted do not outweigh the state
and local need for low- and moderate-income housing.
C. All low- and moderate-income housing units proposed are integrated
throughout the development; are compatible in scale and architectural
style to the market-rate units within the project; and will be built and
occupied prior to, or simultaneous with, the construction and
occupancy of any market-rate units.
D. There will be no significant negative environmental impacts from the
proposed development as shown on the final plan, with all required
conditions for approval.
E. There will be no significant negative impact on the health and safety of
current or future residents of the community, in areas including, but not
limited to, safe circulation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, provision
of emergency services, sewage disposal, availability of potable water,
adequate surface water run-off, and the preservation of natural,
historical or cultural features that contribute to the attractiveness of
the community.
F. All proposed land developments and all subdivision lots will have
adequate and permanent physical access to a public street. Lot
frontage on a public street without physical access shall not be
considered compliance with this requirement.
G. The proposed development will not result in the creation of individual
lots with any physical constraints to development such that building on
those lots according to pertinent regulations and building standards
would be impracticable, unless created only as permanent open space
or permanently reserved for a public purpose on the approved,
recorded plans.
A. The local review board may deny the request for any of the following
reasons:
(1) The Town has an approved affordable housing plan and is meeting
housing needs, and the proposal is inconsistent with the affordable
housing plan. In this section "meeting housing needs" means
adoption of the implementation program of an approved affordable
housing plan and the absence of unreasonable denial of
applications that are made pursuant to an approved affordable
housing plan in order to accomplish the purposes and expectations
of the approved affordable housing plan.
(2) The proposal is not consistent with local needs, including, but not
limited to, the needs identified in an approved Comprehensive Plan,
and/or local zoning ordinances and procedures promulgated in
conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. Local zoning and land
use ordinances, requirements, or regulations are consistent with
§ 400-154 CHARTER § 400-155
C:385
§ 400-156. Voting and appeals. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
All decisions on comprehensive permits shall be by majority vote of the
membership of the local review board and may be appealed by the applicant
to the State Housing Appeals Board. Any person aggrieved by the issuance
of an approval may appeal to the Superior Court within 20 days of the
issuance of approval.
§ 400-157. Expiration of approval; construction schedule.
A comprehensive permit shall expire unless construction is started within
12 months and completed within 60 months of final plan approval unless
a longer and/or phased period for development is agreed to by the local
review board and the applicant. Low- and moderate-income housing units
shall be built and occupied prior to, or simultaneous with, the construction
and occupancy of market-rate units.
local needs when imposed by the Town Council after a
comprehensive hearing, and the Town either has existing lowor
moderate-income housing units in excess of 10% of the yearround
housing units reported in the latest decennial census of the
Town, or the Town has promulgated zoning or land use ordinances,
requirements, and regulations to implement a Comprehensive Plan
which has been adopted and approved pursuant to state law, and
the housing element of the Comprehensive Plan provides for lowor
moderate-income housing in excess of 10% of the year-round
housing units.
(3) The proposal is not in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
(4) The Town has met or has plans to meet the goal of 10% of the yearround
units being low- and moderate-income housing.
(5) Concerns for the environment and the health and safety of current
residents have not been adequately addressed.
B. In the case of a denial, if the applicant fails to meet one or more of the
criteria for approval, where applicable, then the local review board
shall make negative findings on those provisions as part of its decision.

Growth Management
[Added 2-2-2002; amended 3-20-2002;
3-20-2004;7-21-2004;10-18-2004]
§ 400-158. Purpose.
The purpose of growth management is to equitably allocate a limited
number of new residential building permits over time, so as to minimize the
burden on existing facilities and resources, whose adequacy is essential to
the public health, safety and welfare, and in a manner which is consistent
with the West Greenwich Comprehensive Plan. It is the intent of this article
to allow controlled growth in relation to the existing and future capacity
of Town facilities and the Exeter-West Greenwich School District (hereafter
the "School District").
§ 400-159. Findings.
The Town Council, Planning Board, Town staff and consultants have
conducted a study to develop a growth management program as called for
in the Comprehensive Plan. The study is entitled "Town Of West Greenwich,
Rhode Island, Growth Management Program," and was adopted by the Town
Council on February 20, 2002. The Town Council finds that this study,
together with the footnotes and sources, establishes the basis for the Town's
Growth Management Program, and is incorporated herein by reference.
§ 400-160. Issuance of residential building permits.
Issuance of building permits authorizing creation of one or more dwelling
units, as defined by this chapter, through new construction or change of use
shall be allowed under the procedures and requirements set forth herein.
A permit is equivalent to a dwelling unit. Applicants for such residential
building permits shall be authorized to proceed in the manner specified
herein, and in accordance with the priority assigned to them. The total
number of dwelling units authorized to begin construction in any quarter
shall not exceed the calculated quota as established in § 400-161 of this
article.
§ 400-161. Calculated quota.
There shall be a finite number of residential building permits for each
quarter of each year. A "quarter" is defined as a three-month period that
begins on the first day of January, April, July and October. The number of
residential permits to be issued shall be limited in accordance with the
following formula:
A. Total permits per quarter equals the currently available seats within
School District plus any increase of seats that the School District may
provide for through new construction of school facilities over the next
10 years, commencing January 1, 2002 divided by 0.6 less the number
§ 400-158 CHARTER § 400-161
C:387
§ 400-162. Initial quota.
Initially, it has been determined by the Town Council, based upon studies
conducted pursuant to the Comprehensive Plan and studies cited in
§ 400-159, along with data supplied by the School District, the Town's
present capacity for additional dwelling units is based on the following:
1999/2001 - Total Capacity 2,320
Plus Recaptured Seats - Interim Plan 61
Total 2,381
2000/2001 Enrollment 2,130
Existing excess capacity - District wide 251
Existing excess capacity - West Greenwich at
47%
118
Divided by (pupil per dwelling unit ratio here) 0.6
Equals Number of Permits in Ten-Year Period 197
Number of Permits Per Year 20
Number of Permits Per Quarter 5, 5, 5, 5
§ 400-163. Subsequent quotas.
of low- and moderate-income housing permits issued as set forth below
divided by 40 quarters.
B. If any low- and moderate-income housing permits have been issued
pursuant to § 400-166A below, then the number of dwelling units
encompassed in such permits shall be subtracted from the overall
number of permits available, such that the increased school population
from such units is amortized over the remaining years of the Growth
Management Program.
A. Following the method established in § 400-162, the calculation of the
formula for all subsequent quarters shall be performed by the Town
Planner and submitted to the Planning Board and posted in the offices
of the Town Clerk and Building Official not less than 30 days prior to the
commencement of the quarter for which the quota is to be applied. To
assist the Town Planner in her/his calculation, the Town Planner shall
request, in writing, that the Superintendant of Schools supply her/him
with the number of available seats in the School District based on the
current capacity less the actual enrollment as of October 1 of the
current school calendar year, and the increase in seat capacity,
projected from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2011 based upon any
adopted plan of the School District. In addition, the Superintendant of
Schools shall indicate the actual number of pupils from West Greenwich
and the percentage of West Greenwich pupils to the entire School
District's student body.
§ 400-161 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 400-163
C:388
§ 400-164. Effective date.
For the purpose of this article, the effective date shall be February 21,
2002.49 For the remainder of the first quarter of 2002, the Building Official
shall apply the number of permits on a pro-rata basis. Any application for
a building permit creating one or more additional dwelling units submitted
after the effective date of this article shall be subject to the review
procedures set forth herein. Permit applications submitted before the
effective date of this article shall not be subject to any of the quota
limitations of this article. This article shall supersede any and all ordinances
inconsistent herewith.
§ 400-165. Exemptions from quota.
B. The Town Planner shall monitor the School District's overall capacity by
checking with the Superintendant of School every first day of February,
March, August, and November to determine if there are any changes in
available seats. If there are no changes, the Town Planner shall notify
the Town Clerk and Building Official that the number of permits to be
issued the next quarter will be the same as the previous quarter. If
there are changes in seats, or if any low- and moderate-income housing
permits have been issued, the Town Planner shall recalculate the quota
and notify the Town Clerk and Building Official of the new number of
permits to be issued the next quarter. Notwithstanding any changes,
the quota shall not change in the middle of any given quarter.
C. In order to more fairly balance the goals of growth management with
the goal of equitable distribution of available building permits,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Town Council may, in its discretion,
adopt a lesser restriction than the quota derived from this calculation.
Said lesser restriction shall be adopted by resolution of the Town
Council after a public hearing for which notice, in accordance with that
for a public hearing on a zoning amendment, has been given. (Amended
7-21-2004, retroactive to the beginning of the current quarter, having
begun on July 1, 2004.)
A. The following types of dwellings shall not be subject to the provisions of
this article with regard to the calculated quota. These dwellings have
been determined to have no or minimal impact upon the Town's
capacity or provide positive benefits to the Town which are consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan.
B. The Building Official shall accept applications for construction of the
dwellings listed below and shall act upon them without regard to the
quotas, priority determination and procedures as set forth in this
article. All such permits issued shall be considered to be issued in
addition to the calculated quota provisions of this article. Complete
applications for construction of dwelling units so authorized shall be
granted permits within the time limit prescribed in the Rhode Island

Residential Compounds
[Added 5-11-2005; amended 8-9-2006; 10-14-2009; 5-10-2017]
§ 400-178. Definition and purpose.
§ 400-179. Applicability; eligibility for consideration.
Residential compounds may be considered for any subdivision of land
accessed off of a Town or state owned public road, or a private right-of-way
existing on or before May 11, 2005 (date of enactment). An applicant may
petition the Planning Board for consideration of a residential compound, or
the Planning Board may suggest that a proposed subdivision be developed
as a residential compound. To qualify for consideration as a residential
compound, the property and proposed subdivision must satisfy all of the
following conditions; however, satisfaction of all of the following conditions
shall only result in rendering the plan eligible for further consideration as a
residential compound and shall not be construed as approval:
A. A residential compound is a parcel of land containing lots for singlefamily
residential units and having an average density of no greater
than one dwelling unit per four acres of land.
B. Residential compounds are intended to preserve the rural character of
the Town by permitting low-density residential development on large
parcels of land while relieving the applicant from compliance with the
design and improvement standards applicable to other subdivisions.
C. The purpose of the residential compound is to provide qualified
subdividers an option to develop a parcel of land under less stringent
requirements, where, and only where, the Planning Board determines
that such alternative improvement standards will promote development
of the parcel in the best interests of the Town, considering the factors
specified in § 400-180 below. Denial by the Planning Board of a request
to submit an application for a residential compound, or denial of a
residential compound, shall not be construed as denial of the right to
subdivide the property. The applicant shall retain all rights to appeal a
decision to the Zoning Board of Review and/or to submit a plan which
complies with the improvement standards for a conventional
subdivision as set forth in Chapter 450, Land Development and
Subdivision Regulations, of the Town Code. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
A. The subdivision must create at least one new lot, but shall not result in
the creation of more than four new lots in addition to the existing lot
and be located entirely in an RFR-2 Zoning District. (Note: An owner of
an RFR-1 parcel may petition the Board for consideration of a
residential compound.)
§ 400-178 CHARTER § 400-179
C:397
§ 400-180. General requirements and design standards.
B. The permitted uses, minimum lot sizes, and dimensional regulations
applicable to residential compounds shall be those provided in this
chapter for the RFR-2 Zoning District.
C. A parcel proposed for development as a residential compound shall
have a minimum of 30 feet of continuous access to one state-owned or
Town-accepted street.
D. Not more than one residential compound shall be created from any one
property existing on or after May 11, 2005, or within a conventional
subdivision.
E. No more than five lots may derive access from or have frontage on a
residential compound road.
F. The applicant proposing a residential compound off of an existing
private right-of-way shall demonstrate to the Planning Board that the
applicant has the legal ability to use the access for a subdivision/
development.
A. All lots created as part of a residential compound shall have frontage on
a private right-of-way with adequate physical access to a public street.
All private rights-of-way within a residential compound or subdivision
shall remain private in perpetuity. No private residential compound
right-of-way may be extended or connect to another private right-of-way
within another residential compound. At the time of final approval,
Town legal counsel shall approve the form and content of a legal
document, to be recorded simultaneously with the final plat, which
includes a covenant by the owner of the parcel, binding on his
successors and assigns, that the Town of West Greenwich shall not be
asked or required to accept or maintain the private streets within the
parcel, for a minimum of 99 years from the date of recording, or, if only
a lesser period is legally enforceable, for that period with as many
automatic renewals as are necessary to total 99 years. Such restrictions
shall state that any and all future expenses for improvements to private
streets (including drainage) to meet Town requirements shall be borne
by the owners of the property within the residential compound.
B. No lot or parcel which has been developed as part of a residential
compound shall be further subdivided or reduced in size, with the
exception of an administrative subdivision. Administrative subdivisions
shall be for the purpose of lot line adjustments only, and shall not be
intended to contribute developable area for an abutting residential
compound.
(1) Land gained by an Administrative subdivision within the previous
five years shall not count towards the land area required for a
residential compound.
§ 400-179 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 400-180
C:398
(2) Administrative subdivisions may be permitted among residential
lots within the residential compound in accord with these
regulations; provided, however, that such transfers or lot line
amendments maintain conformity with the minimum dimensional
standards contained in this section of this chapter for each lot or
lots so affected and the average density within the approved
residential compound remains at one dwelling per four acres. This
provision shall not prevent the development of a residential
compound in phases as long as future phases are clearly
designated as part of the initial preliminary plan submission.
(3) Administrative subdivisions that propose the transfer of excess
land or open space to a parcel or parcels situated outside the
residential compound shall not be permitted.
C. Land unsuitable for development, as that term is defined in Chapter
450, Land Development and Subdivision Regulations, § 450-8, may be
included as part of any residential building lot; provided, however, that
such land shall not be counted toward the minimum lot area required by
this chapter for the RFR-2 Zoning District. Each lot within a residential
compound must contain a minimum of 1.4 acres of contiguous suitable
land.
D. The private right-of-way shall be contained within defined (metes and
bounds) easements over the proposed lots, not as a separate lot, and
shall not count towards the minimum suitable land requirement.
E. All land area within the residential compound in excess of that
necessary to meet the minimum lot area requirements of this chapter
shall be designated as extra area within one or more residential house
lots.
F. In approving a residential compound, the Planning Board must
determine that all of the general requirements contained in Chapter
450, Land Development and Subdivision Regulations, Article III, have
been met and in addition that one or more of the following design
objectives are met in the proposed development plan:
(1) The number of lots having direct egress onto existing public streets
is less than through conventional subdivision, and the number of
lots having frontage on existing public ways has been less than
through conventional subdivision.
(2) Dwelling units and infrastructure will be constructed in a manner
which will have the least visual impact on the parcel of land in
question as viewed from the public way providing access to the
compound, or from adjacent residentially zoned properties.
(3) Lots will be configured in a manner that preserves primary and
secondary resource areas on the tract or adjacent to the tract, such
as wetlands, watercourses or bodies, open fields, meadows, wildlife
habitat, steep slopes, or other significant areas.

compound shall be privately owned and maintained in common by the
homeowners' association (HOA) for the residential compound. At the time
of final approval, the Planning Board shall approve the form and content
of a document or documents establishing the method of ownership, and
providing for maintenance of common areas, drainage and other
improvements.
§ 400-183. Improvement standards.
A. For the purpose of review and approval, residential compounds shall be
considered minor subdivisions, and are subject to the same review and
approval by the Planning Board under the provisions of Chapter 450,
Land Development and Subdivision Regulations. Any proposed
residential compound shall require a pre-application meeting with the
Planning Board, and a public hearing in accordance with the public
hearing and notice requirements section of the West Greenwich
subdivision regulations. In addition to the submission requirements at
the preliminary plan stage of review contained in the minor subdivision
checklist, an application must contain the following information:
(1) Conventional yield plan.
(2) Scale and area of vegetative screening separating the private rightof-
way and residential compound lots from adjacent residentially
zoned property.
B. For additional requirements of the final plan, see § 400-185 below.
A. Streets and appropriate drainage facilities within a residential
compound shall be designed and constructed in compliance with this
section. The Planning Board shall have the authority to require
additional improvements in order to protect the public health, safety
and welfare, if warranted by the characteristics of the parcel, or if the
street will be used by persons other than residents of the compound.
B. Private rights-of-way within a residential compound shall meet the
following design standards:
(1) A right-of-way intersect width at the existing public road or private
right-of-way of at least 30 feet, for a distance of 50 feet.
(2) A paved staging area of at least 50 feet in length from the edge of
pavement of the street it intersects with, with a minimum width of
20 feet of pavement, and sloped not more than 4% grade for the 50
feet it extends from the street line.
§ 400-181 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 400-183
C:400
(3) Where possible, a compound street center line angle intersection
with the street center line of 90° (perpendicular with the existing
road).

(5) A wear surface, on that portion of the private right-of-way
extending beyond the staging area, of a minimum of 12 inches of
graded gravel, placed over a properly prepared base, graded and
compacted to drain from the crown at a slope of 2%.
(6) Proper drainage appurtenances, where required, to prevent
washout and excessive erosion, with particular attention to the
staging area, so that water draining onto the street surface from
the staging area is eliminated to the maximum extent feasible.
(7) A wear surface, on that portion of the private right-of-way
extending beyond the staging area, with a minimum width of 16
feet for its entire length.
(8) A cul-de-sac, or other teardrop or loop, of not less than 60 feet in
radius provided at the end of each terminus, or alternatively, a
hammerhead design may be employed with dimensions as
approved by the Fire Chief and Director of Public Works.
C. For residential compounds proposed off of an existing private right-ofway,
the Planning Board shall require that the applicant improve the
existing road to meet or exceed the minimum standard for the
residential compound (Subsections A and B above), and if the existing
private road will service a total of more than five lots, the Planning
Board shall require improvements to exceed the minimum standards
contained in Subsections A and B above, including but not limited to
paving and drainage improvements. The applicant shall secure the
permission and agreement of all parties with legal access to the private
right-of-way to perform such upgrades and to be included in a
maintenance agreement.
D. Mailboxes shall be located at the entrance to the private right-of-way
for access from the Town road. Street numbers shall be clearly marked
in compliance with 911 laws.
E. In the event that erosion is causing sediment for the compound to be
deposited on Town roads, the compound will be in violation of Chapter
305, Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, and Chapter 450, Land
Development and Subdivision Regulations. Owners of the compound
lots will be required to take remedial action.

recreation, common open space and/or preservation of environmentally,
historically, culturally or other sensitive features and/or structures. The
techniques used to concentrate buildings shall be specified in the ordinance
and may include, but not be limited to, reduction in lot areas, setback
requirements and/or bulk requirements, with the resultant open land being
devoted by deed restrictions for one or more uses. Under cluster
development there is no increase in the number of lots that would be
permitted under conventional development.
CLUSTER LOT  A lot within a conservation design development with
reduced dimensional requirements as compared to a conventional lot
meeting the requirements of this chapter.
CONSERVATION RESTRICTION  A right to prohibit or require a limitation
upon or an obligation to perform acts on or with respect to or use of a
land or water area, whether stated in the form of a restriction, easement,
covenant or condition, in any deed, will, or other instrument executed by
or on behalf of the owner of the area or in any order of taking, which
right, limitation, or obligation is appropriate to retain or maintain the land
or water area, or is appropriate to provide the public the benefit of the
unique features of the land or water area, including improvements thereon
predominantly in its natural, scenic, or open condition, or in agricultural,
farming, open space, wildlife or forest use, or in other use or condition
consistent with the protection of environmental quality.
HOMESTEAD LOT  A minimum ten-acre lot created as part of a
conservation design development, primarily used for a private residence,
with a secondary use contributing towards one or more purposes of
conservation design development. (An applicant may wish to include a
minimum 11 acres for a homestead lot so that it may qualify for the farm,
forest and open space tax program.)

(c) Those forestry uses as permitted on conservation land in
Subsection B(4) above.
(d) Easements for public access to trails or other forms of access
connecting open space land.
A. Conservation design development provides for two lot size options, for
specific purposes. The Planning Board may require the two lot sizes to
be combined within the development if it finds that such a combination
§ 400-190 CHARTER § 400-191
C:407
would better fulfill the purposes of conservation design development as
stated in this chapter than either of the two single-lot-size options.
(1) The Conservation cluster option provides for residential uses at the
density permitted by the existing zoning, with a minimum lot size of
one acre. Open space and conservation lands consist of a minimum
of 50% of the suitable land plus 100% of the land unsuitable for
development. House lots are clustered on the most suitable areas
for development in order to preserve the environmentally and
culturally sensitive features, and to create neighborhoods where
each home enjoys the benefits of access and views to the open
space. Public access to the open space may be required.
(2) The homestead lot option provides for lower density than the
existing zoning, with larger, privately owned lots of a minimum of
10 acres of suitable land, in order to maintain a rural setting and
private use and management of the land. There is no minimum
requirement for commonly owned or publicly owned open space, or
public access, unless otherwise required by the Planning Board, or
unless the development contains a combination of conservation
cluster lots and homestead lots. Further subdivision of homestead
lots shall be prohibited.
B. Conservation design developments provide for two lot configuration
options: frontage lots and interior building lots (also known as "flag
lots"). Frontage lots contain full frontage dimensional requirements
along the public street. Interior building lots have reduced frontage for
the driveway access at the public street, and the building envelope
portion of the lot is situated behind a frontage lot. Frontage for interior
building lots shall be in accordance with the following table, and all
other dimensional requirements shall be met. The front yard setback for
an interior lot shall be measured parallel to the rear yard setbacks of all
the abutting frontage lots.

of the solar energy system or otherwise prescribed by applicable
laws, regulations, and bylaws/ordinances. The disturbance of
topsoil shall be limited to those areas that are required for the
installation of the proposed solar energy system. Topsoil shall be
stockpiled for re-use, restoration, and stabilization of the site after.
(5) Buffering. Applicants proposing ground-mounted solar energy
systems shall propose an appropriate buffer that adequately
mitigates visual impacts on surrounding properties and the
neighborhood in general. Selection of the proposed buffer should
be based on the context and characteristics of the specific site, and
shall be done in consultation with a landscape designer. Choices
include, but are not limited to: 1) wooded buffer; or 2) full
landscape screen. The Board shall determine the appropriate
buffer based on site conditions. If a full landscape screen is utilized,
the applicant shall post a bond for the maintenance of that
landscape screen during the expected life of the system.
(6) Demarcation and maintenance of buffer. The required buffer shall
be delineated with permanent markers. If a 200-foot setback is
required under § 400-205E(2)(b), the first 150 feet of that setback
distance shall be a no-cut zone, and the only allowable trimming of
buffer vegetation shall be growth (branches/limbs) that overhang
the buffer zone.

(8) Reasonable efforts, as determined by the Board, shall be made to
place all utility connections from the facility underground,
depending upon appropriate soil conditions, shape, topography of
the site, subsurface conditions, and any requirements of the utility
provider.
(9) Lighting of a ground-mounted solar energy system shall be "darksky
rated" and shall be consistent with local, state, and federal law.
Lighting of other parts of the facility, such as appurtenant
structures, shall be limited to that required for safety and
operational purposes, and shall be reasonably shielded from
abutting properties. Where feasible, lighting of the facility shall be
directed downward and shall incorporate full cut-off fixtures to
reduce light pollution.
(10) Financial security. With the exception of roof-mounted structures,
applicants proposing to develop limited solar energy systems shall
be required to provide a form of surety, either through escrow
account, bond or otherwise, to cover the cost of removal in the
event the Town must remove the facility and restore the landscape,
in an amount and form determined to be reasonable by the Board
(and subject to the review of the Town Solicitor), and/or as agreed
to and detailed in the site lease agreements. As part of the review
for the lease agreements, the applicant shall submit a fully
inclusive estimate of the costs associated with removal. The
amount shall include a mechanism for calculating increased
removal costs due to inflation and any expected salvage or resale
value. Such surety will not be required for municipally or stateowned
facilities. The Administrative Officer shall recommend to the

must provide to ensure facility removal and site restoration. The
Planning Board may require the applicant to cover the cost of thirdparty
verification of the estimated removal/decommissioning costs.
The applicant shall submit the financial guarantee before any local
permits are issued.
(11) Removal requirements. With the exception of roof-mounted
structures, any solar energy system that has reached the end of its
useful life or has been abandoned shall be removed. The applicant
shall submit a decommissioning plan to the Zoning Board and/or
Planning Board with the application for project review and
approval. The owner or operator shall physically remove the facility
no more than 180 days after the date of discontinued operations.
The owner or operator shall notify the Board by certified mail no
later than 90 days before the proposed date of discontinued
§ 400-206 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 400-206
C:424
operations and plans for removal. Decommissioning shall consist
of:
(a) Physical removal of all ground-mounted solar energy systems,
structures, equipment and security from the site.
(b) Disposal of all solid and hazardous waste in accordance with
local, state, and federal waste disposal regulations.
(c) Stabilization or revegetation of the site as necessary to
minimize erosion. The Board may allow the owner or operator
to leave landscaping or designated below-grade foundations in
order to minimize erosion and disruption to vegetation.
(12) Abandonment. With the exception of roof-mounted systems, absent
notice of a proposed date of decommissioning or written notice of
extenuating circumstances, the solar energy system shall be
considered abandoned when it fails to operate for more than one
year without the written consent of the Town Council and Planning
Board as it relates to the land development project approval. If the
owner or operator of a limited solar energy system fails to remove
the facility in accordance with the requirements of this section
within 150 days of either abandonment or the proposed date of
decommissioning, the Town may physically remove the facility,
without further notice; and or/may place a lien on the property for
any costs incurred over and above the bond amount, with statutory
interest.

ARTICLE I
Authority and Intent
§ 450-1. Authority.54
These subdivision and land development regulations are adopted pursuant
to the authority contained in Title 45, Chapter 23, Sections 25 through
74, of the Rhode Island General Laws, known as the "Rhode Island Land
Development and Subdivision Review Enabling Act of 1992."
§ 450-2. Purpose.
The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedural and substantive
provisions for the subdivision and/or development of land that will,
consistent with the provisions of the West Greenwich Comprehensive
Community Plan and Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code, accomplish
the following:
A. Protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community.
B. Provide for the orderly, thorough and expeditious review and approval
of land developments and subdivisions.
C. Promote high-quality and appropriate design and construction of land
developments and subdivisions.
D. Protect existing natural and built environments and mitigate the
significant negative impacts of proposed development on those
environments.
E. Promote subdivision and land development designs that are wellintegrated
into surrounding neighborhoods with regard to natural and
built features, and concentrate development in areas that can best
support intensive use because of natural characteristics and existing
infrastructure.
F. Provide for design and construction standards that are appropriate to
the community.
G. Require the dedication of public land, measures for mitigating the
impact of new development on the community, and payment-in-lieu
thereof, that are based on clear documentation of needs and are fairly
applied and administered.
H. Direct the development of land consistent with state-of-the-art practices
that promote and foster growth in a manner that protects the Town's
distinctive character while at the same time accommodating economic
growth.
54.Editor's Note: Amended at time of codification.

§ 450-3. Construction and intent.
I. Guide land development with an emphasis on siting subdivision and
development improvements so as to allow for the maximum
preservation of existing natural features.
J. Ensure that proposed designs institute best management practices that
acknowledge existing site constraints and the natural setting.
K. Encourage the establishment and consistent application of procedures
for local recordkeeping on all matters of land development and
subdivision review, approval and construction.
L. Provide suitable safeguards and consideration for land use and site and
architectural design that is compatible with adjacent districts and uses.
M. Permit development to an extent commensurate with the availability
and capacity of public facilities and services and promote safe
circulation of traffic.
N. Facilitate orderly and harmonious site development, including safe and
convenient provision and design of egress and ingress, off-street
parking, truck loading, internal circulation, emergency access, refuse
disposal, outdoor storage, signage, and lighting, and in compliance with
the requirements of Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code.
O. Protect appropriate vistas and environmental qualities of the Town.
A. These regulations are not intended to supersede, abrogate, or interfere
with any provision of any ordinance of the Town of West Greenwich.
B. Articles I through III and V through XIV of these regulations are
intended to provide general requirements applicable to all subdivisions
and development projects. Article IV of these regulations, governing
certain minor subdivisions and land development projects, are intended
to provide regulations that are supplementary to the general
requirements. In the event of a conflict between a general regulation
and a regulation applicable to a specific type of subdivision or
development, the more specific regulation shall be controlling.
C. These regulations are intended to be interpreted so as to be consistent
with, and further the implementation of, the Comprehensive
Community Plan, the Rhode Island Zoning Enabling Act of 1991

ARTICLE III
General Requirements
§ 450-7. Requirements applicable to all developments and projects.
The requirements listed below shall be applicable to all subdivisions,
developments, and land development projects submitted for approval. Prior
to approval of any subdivision or land development project (if Planning
Board approval is required), the Board shall make positive findings on all
of the standards listed below, as part of the proposed project's record. If
a negative finding for any of these standards is made, the Planning Board
shall have grounds for denial of the project design.
A. Each subdivision and/or development shall be consistent with the
requirements of the West Greenwich Comprehensive Community Plan
and/or shall satisfactorily address the issues where there may be
inconsistencies;
B. Each lot in the subdivision shall conform to the standards and
provisions of Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code; provided,
however, that lots not being created for the purpose of present or future
development need not meet the area and other dimensional
requirements of Chapter 400, provided that:
(1) A notation is shown on the recorded plat that the lot being created
is not a buildable lot; and
(2) A conservation or preservation easement pursuant to Title 34,
Chapter 39 of the Rhode Island General Laws, as amended, is
granted to the Town of West Greenwich prohibiting any such
present or future development;
C. There will be no significant negative environmental impacts from the
proposed development as shown on the final plan, with all required
conditions for approval;
D. Subdivision, as proposed, will not result in the creation of individual
lots with such physical constraints to development that building on
those lots according to pertinent regulations and building standards
would be impracticable. See the definition of "buildable lot." Lots with
such physical constraints to development may be created only if
identified as permanent open space or permanently reserved for a
public purpose on the approved, recorded plans;
E. All proposed land developments and all subdivision lots shall have
adequate and permanent physical access to a public street. Lot
frontage on a public street without physical access shall not be
considered compliance with this requirement;
F. Each subdivision and development shall provide for safe circulation of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic, for surface water run-off control, for
suitable building sites, and for preservation of natural, historical, or
§ 450-7 CHARTER § 450-7
C:441
§ 450-8. Land unsuitable for development; minimum buildable area.
cultural features that contribute to the attractiveness of the community;
and
G. The design and location of streets, building lots, utilities, drainage
improvements and other improvements in each subdivision or
development shall minimize flooding and soil erosion.
A. When designing the layout of buildable lots or units permitted on any
parcel, the minimum lot areas specified for that property in Chapter
400, Zoning, of the Town Code must be provided for each lot or unit and
be free of any of the constraints identified in Subsection A(1) through
(5) below. Land included in all of the following categories shall be
considered unsuitable for development.
(1) Freshwater wetlands, not including areas subject to storm flowage
(ASSF), but including that area of perimeter wetland within 50 feet
of the edge of any bog, marsh, swamp or pond; and any applicable
one-hundred-foot or two-hundred-foot riverbank wetlands, as
defined by R.I.G.L. § 2-1-20 (1987), as amended; and drainage
facilities.
(2) Areas within a one-hundred-year flood zone, as defined by FEMA.
(3) Land within any existing and proposed easement areas for utility
use, access, or drainage.
(4) Areas which exceed 15% slope prior to any construction. (See
Article XIII, § 450-57.)
(5) Historical cemeteries.
B. Land described in Subsection A(1) through (5) above may be included
as part of any lot in any subdivision or land development project;
provided, however, that it shall not necessitate a waiver, modification or
variance of any dimensional requirement specified in Article II of
Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code or of any state or federal
regulatory requirement.
C. In addition to the minimum buildable area requirement, each lot shall
contain a minimum amount of contiguous suitable land for
development. A minimum of 70% of the minimum lot size in each zoning
district shall be contiguous suitable land and shall be accessible from
the lot's frontage for the development site.
D. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that all proposed lots are
minimally suited to the uses allowed under Chapter 400, Zoning, of the
Town Code, and that all lots should contain building envelopes that are
not constrained to such uses. The concept of the minimum buildable
area is intended to ensure that each lot created through the subdivision

C:442
§ 450-9. Dedication of land for public purposes.
review process will possess a suitable area for the full use and
enjoyment of its subsequent owner.
A. The developer must provide open space (fee in-lieu-of). The Planning
Board shall require all land developments and subdivisions, subject to
the provisions of Subsection B below, to dedicate a portion of the
buildable land being subdivided for the purpose of providing open
space, conservation, park and recreational facilities to serve present
and future residents of the proposed land development or subdivision.
The Planning Board may, in its discretion, require the payment of a fee
in-lieu-of land dedication, or a combination of land dedication and
payment of a fee, as an alternative to the dedication of land.
B. Relationship to Comprehensive Plan. No dedication of land to the public
or payments in lieu of such dedications shall be required unless the
need for such is documented in the adopted West Greenwich
Comprehensive Community Plan, the West Greenwich Recreation,
Conservation and Open Space Plan, or the Capital Improvement
Program (CIP). The requirement for dedication of land for open space,
conservation, park and recreation facilities shall be based upon the
policies and standards set forth in the above plans or in the CIP and
shall reflect the character defined for the neighborhood or district in
which the subdivision is located by the Comprehensive Community
Plan. The nature of the land dedication must reflect the character of the
land being subdivided and must be suitable for the intended use. If
payments in lieu of land dedication are required, they must be kept in a
restricted account and shall only be spent for the intended purpose of
providing open space, conservation, park and recreational facilities.
C. Park, playground, and open space reservations.
(1) Payment in lieu of dedication.
(a) A payment in lieu of dedication of land shall be imposed on the
applicant by the Planning Board in an amount equal to the
current market value of the land to be dedicated within the
subdivision property, with all improvements in place. If, in the
opinion of the Planning Board, the dedication of land (or a
combination of payment in-lieu-of and land dedication) is
superior to the fee in-lieu-of only, then the Planning Board shall
determine the amount of land for dedication in accordance
with Subsection C(2) below.
(b) Current market value. Current market value of the land which
would otherwise be dedicated shall be determined by the Tax
Assessor at the time of filing the final plan, in accordance with
recent land sales.
(2) Recreation standards.
§ 450-8 CHARTER § 450-9
C:443
(a) The Planning Board may require that land be reserved for
parks and playgrounds, open space or other recreation
purpose within the proposed subdivision or in locations
designated on the Recreation, Conservation and Open Space
Plan, or otherwise where such reservations would be
appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size,
dimension, topography, and general character and shall have
adequate road access for the particular purposes envisioned by
the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall determine the
number of acres to be reserved from the following formula:
Amount of land to be dedicated = 2,000 square feet per lot
(b) Multifamily residential. The Planning Board shall determine
the acreage for reservation based on the number of dwelling
units per acre to occupy the site, as well as other relevant
factors, including without limitation topography and expected
use and utilization of the site, but in no case shall the acreage
for reservation be less than 2,000 square feet per dwelling
unit.
(c) Ownership of open space. The required open space may be
conveyed to the Town, to the State of Rhode Island, to a private
homeowners' association (HOA), or a private nonprofit
conservation or recreation group. The final plan shall be
accompanied by a detailed statement, including covenants,
agreements and other documents showing the proposed
ownership and methods of maintenance and utilization of the
open space.
(3) Recreation sites. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of
a size, character and location suitable for use as a playground,
playfield, or other recreation purposes, and shall be relatively level
and dry.
(4) Other recreation reservation. The provisions of this section are
minimum standards. None of the subsections above shall be
construed as prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for
recreation purposes in addition to the requirements of this section.
(5) Exemptions.
(a) Affordable housing. Those lots or dwellings created for the
purpose of low- or moderate-income housing, as that term is
defined in Chapter 400, Zoning, Article I, § 400-4, shall be
exempt from the requirement to dedicate land, or pay a fee inlieu-
of land dedication for open space and recreation purposes.
This exemption shall apply solely to the affordable lots (or units
if multifamily). This exemption shall be considered a direct
municipal government subsidy program for the production of
affordable housing in the Town.
§ 450-9 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-9
C:444
§ 450-10. Fire suppression.
The Planning Board shall require all developments and subdivisions to
deed the appropriate West Greenwich Fire Department an easement(s)
for a portion of the land being subdivided or developed, and to require
the installation of a concrete cistern(s) on that portion(s) of land, for the
purpose of providing fire suppression to serve present and future residents
or patrons of the proposed development or subdivision. The Planning Board
may, in its discretion, with input from the appropriate Fire Chief or his
designee, require the payment of a fee in-lieu-of a deeded easement(s)
and installation of a cistern(s), or a combination of deeded easement(s)
and payment of a fee(s), as an alternative to the deeded easement(s) and
installation of a concrete cistern(s).
(b) Town residents. Any Town of West Greenwich resident who has
resided in the Town for a period of 10 years or greater shall be
exempt from the requirement to dedicate land for open space
and recreation, or pay a fee in-lieu-of, for a maximum of two
dwelling units, provided that satisfactory evidence shall be
submitted to the Town as part of the final plan application,
demonstrating that the lots and/or dwelling units are being
conveyed to a relative of the ten-year resident, as a primary
residency. A "relative" for purposes of this section is a
grandparent, parent, child, grandchild, brother, or sister. In the
event that the home or lot is sold or rented to a non-family
member within five years of the recording of the lot, an open
space and recreation fee shall be assessed at the then-current
rate. To this effect, at the time of recording of the lot, a lien will
be placed on the property for a period of five years.
A. Determination of need. No deed of easement(s) and installation of a
concrete cistern(s), or the payment-in-lieu of such dedications shall be
required unless the appropriate Fire Chief has stated in writing that a
need exists. The written determination of the appropriate Fire Chief
shall not be appealable.
B. Authority.
(1) Pursuant to Chapter 400, Zoning, Article I, § 400-2I, of the Town
Code, it is the purpose of the zoning ordinance to provide for
orderly growth and development which: "[P]romotes safety from
fire, flood, and other natural or man-made disasters." Additionally,
it is the findings of the adopted Strategy for Reducing Risks from
Natural Hazards, West Greenwich, Rhode Island, November 2000,
that a fire suppression ordinance is vital for the protection of
persons and property.
(2) This section is in conformance with the Rhode Island Development
Impact Fee Act of 2000 as stated in R.I.G.L. § 45-22.4-1 et seq.57

(2) The above standards shall not be applicable for the original parcel
of any residential subdivision. The original parcel shall count as a
parcel for the purposes of this section. This section shall apply to all
residential and nonresidential developments and subdivisions.
D. Payment in-lieu of deeded easement(s) and/or installation of concrete
cistern(s).
(1) A payment in lieu of deeded easement(s) and/or the installation of
concrete cistern(s) may be imposed on the applicant by the
Planning Board in the amount of $1,500 per parcel, under the
following circumstances:
(a) The Planning Board and/or the appropriate Fire Chief
determines that the installation of a concrete cistern(s) would
not serve the best interests of the Town. Considered factors
shall be, but are not limited to, the proximity of other concrete
cisterns within 2,200 linear feet of the proposed land
development or subdivision, accessibility by emergency
vehicles and density of surrounding developments.

Special Requirements
§ 450-13. Phasing of major land developments and major
subdivisions.
A. When a major land development and major subdivision is submitted for
master plan approval as provided in Article V, § 450-19D(3), the
Planning Board shall review the adequacy of existing and projected
future public improvements, services and facilities which may be
impacted by the proposed development in its entirety. If the Planning
Board determines that such improvements, services and facilities,
including but not limited to water supply, sewerage, streets and
associated drainage facilities, schools, recreational facilities, and fire
and police protection will not be adequate to serve the residents of the
subdivision or development at the time of recording of the plat, the
Planning Board shall have the authority to establish a rate of
development of the entire subdivision or development by requiring it to
be built in phases.
B. When an application is submitted for master plan approval, the
applicant shall submit to the applicable municipal, state or private
agency, as provided in the master plan checklist for major land
developments and major subdivisions, a copy of the master plan
narrative report for its review and comment. Each agency so notified by
the applicant, proof of which shall be presented to the administrative
officer, shall be requested to provide its comments in writing to the
Planning Board. Comments shall be received from each agency prior to
the date of the informational meeting. If comments are not received by
the administrative officer by that date, it shall be assumed that the
agency does not wish to comment. If the public informational meeting
on the master plan and the public hearing on the preliminary plan are
combined as provided in Article V, § 450-19D(3)(d), all comments from
reviewing agencies shall be received prior to the date of the public
hearing.
C. Each department or agency to which such a request for comments is
made shall deliver to the administrative officer, in addition to the
written correspondence, any supplementary material, which shall
describe:
(1) An estimate of the impact of the subdivision or development on the
facilities and/or services provided by the department or agency;
(2) Whether existing facilities and/or services are adequate to serve
the subdivision's or development's residents;
(3) Whether plans for the necessary improvements to existing facilities
and/or services are included in the Town's Capital Improvement
Program or are otherwise planned; and
§ 450-13 CHARTER § 450-13
C:449
§ 450-14. Land development projects.
Minor land development projects and major land development projects are
provided for by Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code and are herein
included. Approval of a land development project shall be in accordance
with the procedures established by these land development and subdivision
regulations, including those for appeal and judicial review. Regulations
governing the zoning requirements for land development projects are
included in Chapter 400. (See Chapter 400, Article XVIII.)
§ 450-15. Development plan review.
(Formerly "site plan review.")
(4) An estimate of how long it would take to provide any necessary
improvements to existing facilities and/or services.
D. Based on the responses received from the various departments and
agencies, the Planning Board shall establish, at the time of master plan
approval, a rate of development of the entire subdivision or
development that will permit residential construction only when
improvements, services and facilities will be adequate to serve the
residents of the subdivision or development. As part of such a growth
rate plan, the Planning Board may require that improvements be
installed, or lots sold, in two or more phases.
E. If phasing is required, the Planning Board shall approve the entire
master plan first. Thereafter, the applicant shall be required to submit
plans for preliminary and/or final review and/or approval indicating the
development of the entire site in two or more phases as required by the
Planning Board in § 450-7D of this article, above. In such review and
approval, the Board may, in its discretion, impose conditions for
determining the physical limits of phases, for allowing progression to
additional phases, for allowing two or more phases to proceed in review
or construction simultaneously, for interim public improvements or
construction conditions, for changes to master or preliminary plans,
and may include other provisions as necessitated by special conditions.
F. The master plan documents may contain information on the physical
limits of the phases, the schedule and sequence of public improvement
installation, improvement guarantees, and the work and completion
schedules for approvals and construction of the phases.
A. Development plan review (DPR), as provided in Chapter 400, Zoning, of

and in the checklists included as attachments to this chapter.
(2) Submission requirements are noted on the checklists included as
attachments to this chapter.
B. No building permit may be issued for any building except in
conformance with an approved development plan. No certificate of
occupancy may be issued for any building or use of land within the
purview of Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code unless the building is
constructed or used, or the land is developed or used in conformity with
an approved development plan. Every application for development plan
approval shall be accompanied by a certification by the West Greenwich
Planning Board to the effect that the plan meets all the specific
applicable requirements of Chapter 400, Zoning, and the land
development and subdivision regulations.
C. Development plan review by the Planning Board shall be required in all
zoning districts for:
(1) The erection, enlargement or change of use of any building or other
structure, other than single-family dwellings. Any variance, special
use permit, or rezoning for a use other than single-family
residential shall be referred by the Zoning Board of Review or the
Town Council to the Planning Board for the Planning Board's
review and recommendation as to the adequacy of the development
plans;
(2) All uses of open land for which a certificate of occupancy is
required; and
(3) Any amendment of a previously approved development plan.
D. General criteria and standards. Refer to Article XIII, Physical Design
Requirements and Public Improvement Standards.
A. Definition. Conservation design development is a type of residential
cluster land development project, as authorized by R.I.G.L. § 45-24-47,
which preserves at least 50% of a property as meaningful open space,
while developing the most appropriate areas within the parcel on
reduced-sized lots such that density remains neutral. It is an alternative
to conventional residential subdivision.
B. Conservation design development, as provided for in Chapter 400,
Zoning, Article XX, of the Town Code shall be reviewed and approved by
the Planning Board in accordance with the procedures and
requirements contained in these regulations. Additional submission
requirements are noted in Article V, § 450-23, and have been included
on the checklists.60
§ 450-15 CHARTER § 450-16
C:451
C. The Planning Board shall have the authority to require that a major or
minor subdivision which is being proposed for conventional subdivision
be developed as a conservation design development. The Board shall
notify the applicant of such no later than the master plan review stage
for a major subdivision, and no later than the preliminary plan review
stage for a minor subdivision, and shall make findings of fact in writing
supporting the requirement.
D. General criteria and standards. Refer to Article XIII, Physical Design
Requirements and Public Improvement Standards.
E. Procedure for review and approval. Refer to Article V, Procedure for
Review and Approval of Plats and Plans.
F. Open space use. See Chapter 400, Zoning, Article XX, of the Town Code,
for uses allowed within the open space/conservation land. The Planning
Board shall approve of the individual uses proposed for each open
space/conservation land parcel as part of the plan review process. A
specific land management plan may be required by Chapter 400,
Zoning, or the Planning Board for the intended use. The approved uses
shall be described in the required open space use, maintenance, and
operation plan, which may incorporate any specific land management
plan.
G. Restrictions and required conditions of approval. (Cross-referenced
from Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code, Article XX.)
(1) Further subdivision of all house lots and common open space
created as part of a conservation design development, including
homestead lots, shall be prohibited in perpetuity.
(2) The required open space shall be restricted in perpetuity from
future development, except in accordance with an approved open
space use, maintenance, and operation plan.
(3) Changes in the use of the open space shall be in accordance with
those uses allowable within the open space in a conservation
design development, as governed by Chapter 400, Zoning, of the
Town Code, and shall be approved by the Planning Board as an
amendment to the plan.
(4) No disturbance to the open space shall be made to the natural
contours of the land nor shall any existing natural vegetation be
removed or any natural or man-made features be altered in any
way. Clearing and excavation of open space areas shall be
permitted only for the installation of stormwater drainage facilities,
or for permitted disturbance associated with implementing an
approved open space use, maintenance, and operation plan.

required for all open space, whether privately, publicly, or
commonly owned, and regardless of any other conservation
easement, and shall incorporate the following requirements:
(a) All open space shall be protected against further development
and unauthorized alteration in perpetuity by appropriate deed
restrictions through the grant of a conservation restriction to
the Town of West Greenwich, the West Greenwich Land Trust,
or other nonprofit conservation group, pursuant to Title 34,
Chapter 39 of the Rhode Island General Laws, as amended.
(b) In addition, the perpetual maintenance of all open space shall
be guaranteed by appropriate deed restrictions. The Planning
Board (legal counsel) shall approve the form and content of all
deed restrictions at the time of final approval of the
subdivision. Every deed restriction providing a perpetual
maintenance guarantee shall contain the following provision:
"If the owners, or their successors or assigns, fail to maintain
the open space, the restriction holder may perform any
necessary maintenance and enforce the payment for such
costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, by an action at law
or in equity against the owners or their successors or assigns."
(c) The permanent conservation restriction shall be duly recorded
in the Land Evidence Records, and shall define the range of
permitted activities, as approved by the Planning Board, and
include all restrictions as noted in this Subsection G.
(d) In the event that the Town of West Greenwich is the proposed
owner of the open space, the conservation restriction shall be
held by both the Town and either the West Greenwich Land
Trust or other nonprofit conservation organization.
H. Open space ownership. (Cross-referenced here from Chapter 400,
Zoning, of the Town Code, Article XX; see Chapter 400 for ownership
requirements.) Conservation land within a conservation development
subdivision shall be doubly protected through fee simple ownership and
a conservation restriction in the form of a conservation easement, at the
discretion of the Planning Board. The Planning Board may require two
or more conservation easement holders. Open space land shall not be
transferred to another entity except for transfer to another method of
ownership permitted under this subsection.
(1) Open space shall be owned in fee simple by any one or more of the
following entities, as further described in Chapter 400, Zoning,

particular area.
I. Open space maintenance and management.
(1) The Planning Board shall specifically authorize property
management plans for the use, management, and maintenance of
all open space areas and facilities, in perpetuity, within any
conservation development. No grading or clearing of vegetation
shall be permitted within the open space land; provided, however,
the Planning Board may permit disturbance for installation of
landscaping, parks, trails, or recreation areas; or for activities
germane to agriculture, conservation, forestry, or wildlife habitat

with the necessary regular and periodic operation and
maintenance responsibilities, and responsible parties, for the
various uses of open space (i.e., lawns, buildings, playing
fields, landscaped areas, meadows, pastures, croplands,
woodlands, wildlife habitat, etc.) to implement those goals.
§ 450-16 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-16
C:454
(e) The plan shall include provisions for inspections and a
description of how the property will be monitored.
(f) The plan shall estimate staffing needs, insurance
requirements, and associated costs and define the means for
funding the maintenance of the open space land and operation
of any common facilities on an ongoing basis. Such funding
plan shall include the means for funding long-term capital
improvements as well as regular yearly operation and
maintenance costs.
(g) The plan shall include an amendment procedure. Any changes
to the plan at any point in time shall be approved by the West
Greenwich Planning Board.

conservation organization.
(4) In the event that the organization established to manage the open
space lands and the common facilities, or any successor
organization thereto, fails to maintain all or any portion of the open
space or common facilities in reasonable order and condition, the
Town restriction holder may assume responsibility for
maintenance, in which case any escrow funds may be forfeited and
any permits may be revoked or suspended. The Town restriction
holder shall first serve written notice upon the responsible party,
noting the specific failures to maintain the open space, and shall
include corrective actions and a time line. Upon failure to comply
within the time specified, the owner shall be in violation. The Town
restriction holder may enter the premises and take corrective
action, including extended maintenance. The costs of such
corrective action may be charged to the property owner,
condominium association, homeowners' association, conservation
organization, or individual property owners who make up a
condominium or homeowners' association and may include
administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien
on said properties. Notice of such lien shall be filed by the Town
restriction holder in the Land Evidence Records.

ARTICLE V
Procedure for Review and Approval of Plats and Plans
§ 450-17. General requirements
§ 450-18. Certification of complete application.
A. The Planning Board shall consider each application for subdivision or
development according to the procedure set forth in this article, unless
otherwise specifically provided.
B. An applicant for subdivision or development who wishes the Planning
Board to take some official action on his or her application shall submit
to the administrative officer all of the materials required by the
checklists included as attachments to this chapter. If the requested
action is not applicable under any of the checklists, such as a request
for an extension of an approval, the applicant shall submit a written
request to the administrative officer describing the requested action to
be taken by the Planning Board. The matter will be placed on the next
available agenda of the Planning Board only if the administrative officer
determines that all of the required material has been submitted and
only after a certificate of completeness has been issued in accordance
with the applicable provisions of these regulations.
C. Any submission of materials to the administrative officer shall be
accompanied by a cover letter or letter of transmittal indicating the
date, the materials being submitted and the requested action. No
materials shall be accepted by the administrative officer without said
cover letter. Upon receipt of any materials, the administrative officer
shall stamp the date of receipt upon them.
D. If an application is made by someone other than the owner of the land
being developed, the applicant shall submit a written statement from
the owner authorizing such application.
A. An application shall be complete for purposes of commencing the
applicable time period for action when so certified by the administrative
officer. Certification of a complete application shall be made in writing
by the administrative officer upon a form entitled "Certificate of
Completeness." A copy of said certificate shall be provided to the
applicant. In the event such certification of the application is not made
within the time specified in these regulations for the type of plan being
proposed, the application shall be deemed complete for purposes of
commencing the review period unless the application lacks information
required for such applications as specified in the checklists included as
attachments to this chapter, and the administrative officer has notified
the applicant, in writing, of the deficiencies in the application.
B. Notwithstanding Subsection A, the Planning Board may subsequently
require the applicant to correct any information found to be in error
and/or to submit additional information specified in the regulations but
§ 450-17 CHARTER § 450-18
C:457
§ 450-19. Procedure for approval.
The Planning Board shall consider applications for subdivision and/or
development according to the following procedures:
not required by the administrative officer prior to certification, as is
necessary to make an informed decision.
C. Where review is postponed with the consent of the applicant, pending
further information or revision of information, the time period for
review shall be stayed and shall resume when the administrative officer
or the Planning Board determines that the required application
information is complete.62
D. For the purposes of calculating mandatory review periods as provided
in these regulations, all days shall be considered to be calendar days.
A. Pre-application meetings and concept review.
(1) An applicant requesting subdivision or development review shall
first contact the administrative officer to arrange a meeting with
the Planning Department and other Town staff. At the staff meeting,
the applicant and planning staff shall determine if a pre-application
meeting with the Planning Board is required by these regulations
or is desired by either the applicant or the Town.
(2) If a pre-application meeting is required or requested, the applicant
shall submit all the information required by the Checklist for Preapplication
Meetings and Concept Review included as an
attachment to this chapter. The planning staff will review and
comment on the checklist information and, if determined to be
complete, will schedule the application to appear before the
Planning Board.
(3) If no pre-application meeting is required or requested, the
applicant will be advised by the administrative officer as to the
requirements of the land development and subdivision regulations
and the procedure to be followed by the applicant for review.
(4) One or more pre-application meetings shall be held before the
Planning Board for all major land development or subdivision
applications, all minor land developments, all minor subdivision
with road creation applications, all residential compound
applications, and all development plan applications. Preapplication
meetings may be held for administrative subdivisions
and frontage lot minor subdivision applications, upon request of
either the Town, acting through the Planning Department, or the
applicant. Pre-application meetings shall allow the applicant to
meet with the Planning Board for advice as to the required steps in
the approval process. Where appropriate, Town officials, boards
62.Editor's Note: Amended at time of codification.
§ 450-18 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-19
C:458
and/or commissions, planning staff and state agencies shall be
notified of the pre-application meetings and invited to provide
comments on the proposed subdivision or land development plan.
(5) At the pre-application stage, the applicant may request an informal
concept plan review for a development. The purpose of the concept
plan review is also to provide the applicant with Planning Board
input in the formative stages of subdivision or development concept
design.
(6) Pre-application meetings shall aim to encourage information
sharing and discussion of project concepts among the participants.
Pre-application meetings should include a review of the physical
character of the land, and any environmental or physical
constraints to development. Meetings should include a discussion
initiated by the Planning Board regarding what form of land
development may be appropriate to meet the goals and policies of
the Comprehensive Plan with regard to preserving the character of
the land, the natural environment and the ability of the Town to
provide essential services. Pre-application discussions are intended
for the guidance of the applicant and shall not be considered
approval of a project or of any of its elements. No formal action
need be taken by the Planning Board at the pre-application
meeting.
(7) Provided that at least one pre-application meeting has been held
for the development or subdivision application or 60 days have
elapsed from the filing of the pre-application submission and no
pre-application meeting has been scheduled to occur within said 60
days, nothing shall be deemed to preclude an applicant from
thereafter filing and proceeding with an application for a
development or subdivision project in accordance with Subsection
D of this section.
B. Administrative subdivisions.
(1) Any applicant requesting approval of a proposed administrative
subdivision as herein defined shall submit to the administrative
officer the items required by the Checklist for Administrative
Subdivisions included as an attachment to this chapter.
(2) The application shall be certified, in writing, as complete or
incomplete by the administrative officer within a fifteen-day period
from the date of its submission according to the provisions of
§ 450-18 of this article.63
(3) Within 15 days of certification of completeness, the administrative
officer, or the Technical Review Committee, shall review the
application and approve, deny, or refer it to the Planning Board
with recommendations. The officer or committee shall report its
63.Editor's Note: Amended at time of codification.
§ 450-19 CHARTER § 450-19
C:459
actions to the Planning Board at its next regular meeting, to be
made part of the record. If no action is taken by the administrative
officer within the fifteen-day mandatory review period, the
application shall be placed on the agenda of the next regular
Planning Board meeting.64
(4) If referred to the Planning Board, the Board shall consider the
application and the recommendations of the administrative officer
and shall either approve, approve with conditions, or deny the
application within 65 days of the certification of completeness.
Failure of the Planning Board to act within the period prescribed
shall constitute approval of the administrative subdivision plan and
a certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure of the
Planning Board to act within the required time and the resulting
approval shall be issued on request of the applicant.
(5) Denial of an application by the administrative officer shall not be
appealable and shall require the plan to be submitted as a minor
subdivision application.
(6) Any approval of an administrative subdivision shall be evidenced by
a written decision, which shall be filed in the office of the Town
Clerk.
(7) Approval of an administrative subdivision shall expire 90 days from
the date of approval unless within such period of time a plat in
conformity with such approval is submitted for signature and
recording as provided in Article VI.
C. Minor land developments, minor subdivisions, and development plans.
(1) Review stages. Plan review shall consist of at least two stages: 1)
preliminary; and 2) final. A pre-application meeting is also required
for development plans and for minor subdivisions with road
creation. A pre-application meeting may also be held for minor
subdivisions without road creation, as provided in Subsection A of
this section. The Planning Board may vote to combine the approval
stages, provided that requirements for all stages so combined have
been met by the applicant to the satisfaction of the Planning Board.
(2) Submission requirements. Any applicant requesting approval of a
proposed minor subdivision, minor land development, or
development plan, as defined in these regulations, shall submit to
the administrative officer the plans and supporting materials
provided in the Preliminary Plat Checklist for Minor Land
Development, Minor Subdivisions, and Development Plans included
as an attachment to this chapter.
(3) Certification of preliminary plat. The application shall be certified
complete or incomplete by the administrative officer within 25
64.Editor's Note: Amended at time of codification.
§ 450-19 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-19
C:460
days, or within 15 days if no street is required, according to the
provisions of § 450-18 of this article. The running of the time period
set forth herein shall be deemed stopped upon the issuance of
a certificate of incompleteness of the application by the
administrative officer and shall recommence upon the
resubmission of a corrected application by the applicant. However,
in no event shall the administrative officer be required to certify
a corrected submission as complete or incomplete fewer than 14
days after its resubmission.
(4) Site visit. Before the preliminary plan is approved, the Planning
Board may request a site visit of the property. In order to facilitate
the site visit, temporary staking of all proposed roadways,
improvements and site features may be required by the Planning
Board based on the level of information available at that stage of
review.
(5) Reassignment to major review. The Planning Board may reassign a
proposed minor land development, minor subdivision, or
development plan to major review only when the Planning Board is
unable to make the positive findings required in Article III, § 450-7.
(6) Decision. If no street creation or extension is required, the
Planning Board shall approve, deny, or approve with conditions the
preliminary plan within 65 days of certification of completeness, or
within such further time as is agreed to by the applicant and the
Board. If a street creation or extension is required, the Planning
Board shall hold a public hearing prior to taking any action
according to the requirements set forth in Subsection D(5) of this
section. The Planning Board shall approve, deny, or approve with
conditions the preliminary plan for a minor subdivision with street
creation, a minor land development project, or a development plan
within 95 days of the issuance of the certificate of completeness by
the administrative officer as provided in Subsection C(3) of this
section, above; provided, however, that if an extension of time is
agreed to by the applicant and the Board as provided in § 450-18 of
this article, this time period shall be stayed.
(7) Failure to act. Failure of the Planning Board to act within the period
prescribed in Subsection C(5) or (6) of this section shall constitute
approval of the preliminary plan and a certificate of the
administrative officer as to the failure of the Planning Board to act
within the required time and the resulting approval shall be issued
on request of the applicant.
(8) Final plan/as-built review. The Planning Board may delegate final
plan review and approval to either the administrative officer or the
Technical Review Committee (TRC); otherwise, the Board shall
review the final plan itself. When the review and approval of the
final plan is delegated to the administrative officer or TRC, the
administrative officer or TRC shall report its actions, in writing, to
§ 450-19 CHARTER § 450-19
C:461
the Planning Board at its next regular meeting, to be made part of
the record.65
(9) Expiration of approval. Approval of a minor land development or
subdivision plan shall expire 90 days from the date of approval
unless within such period a plat or plan in conformity with such
approval, and as defined in Article II, is submitted for signature and
recording as specified in Article VI. For minor subdivision or land
development projects with street creation or extension, approval
shall expire one year from the date of approval unless within such
period final as-built plans are submitted to the Board. For
development plans, approval shall expire one year from the date of
approval unless within such period a building permit is issued.
Validity may be extended for a longer period for cause shown, if
requested by the applicant in writing and approved by the Planning
Board.
D. Major land developments and major subdivisions.
(1) Review stages. Major plan review shall consist of four stages of
review: 1) pre-application meeting(s); 2) master plan; 3)
preliminary plan; and 4) final plan. Also required is a public
informational meeting and a public hearing. The Planning Board
may vote to combine review stages and to modify and/or waive
requirements as specified in Article VIII. Review stages may be
combined only after the Planning Board determines that all
necessary requirements for all stages so combined have been met
by the applicant.
(2) Submission requirements: pre-application.
(a) Any applicant requesting approval of a proposed major
subdivision or major land development, as defined in these
regulations, shall first submit to the administrative officer the
plans and supporting materials provided in the Pre-Application
Checklist for Major Land Developments and Major
Subdivisions included as an attachment to this chapter. The
procedure and criteria for pre-application meetings and
concept review as provided in Subsection A of this section shall
apply.
(b) At the conclusion of the pre-application meeting(s), the
applicant may proceed to the master plan stage of review.
(3) Master plan.
(a) Submission requirements.
[1] Any applicant requesting approval of a proposed major
subdivision or major land development, as defined in these
65.Editor's Note: Amended at time of codification.
§ 450-19 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-19
C:462
regulations, shall first submit to the administrative officer
the plans and supporting materials provided in the Master
Plan Checklist for Major Land Developments and Major
Subdivisions included as an attachment to this chapter.
[2] The purpose of the master plan stage of review is to
provide the applicant with the opportunity to present an
overall plan for a proposed project site outlining general,
rather than detailed, development intentions. The master
plan describes the basic parameters of a major
development proposal, rather than giving full engineering
details. Initial comments on the master plan shall be
solicited from local agencies, adjacent communities, state
agencies, and federal agencies, as required in the master
plan checklist. The administrative officer shall coordinate
review and comments by participating agencies.
(b) Certification of master plan application. The application shall
be certified, in writing, complete or incomplete by the
administrative officer within 60 days of its receipt according to
the provisions of § 450-18 of this article. The running of the
time period set forth herein shall be deemed stopped upon the
issuance of a certificate of incompleteness of the application by
the administrative officer and shall recommence upon the
resubmission of a corrected application by the applicant.
However, in no event shall the administrative officer be
required to certify a corrected submission as complete or
incomplete fewer than 14 days after its resubmission.66
(c) Site visit. Before the master plan is approved, the Planning
Board may request a site visit of the property. In order to
facilitate the site visit, temporary staking of all proposed
roadways, improvements and site features may be required by
the Planning Board based on the level of information available
at that stage of review.
(d) Informational meeting. A public informational meeting shall be
held prior to the Planning Board decision on the master plan,
unless the master plan and preliminary plan approvals are
being combined, in which case the public informational
meeting shall be optional, based on Planning Board
determination. In such case, review stages may be combined
only after the Planning Board determines that all necessary
requirements for all stages so combined have been met by the
applicant.
[1] Public notice for the informational meeting is required and
shall be given at least seven days prior to the date of the
meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the
66.Editor's Note: Amended at time of codification.
§ 450-19 CHARTER § 450-19
C:463
Town. Postcard notice shall be mailed by the applicant
to all property owners within the notice area. The notice
area for informational meetings shall be as specified in
Subsection D(5) of this section, below.
[2] At the public informational meeting, the applicant, or his
or her representative(s), shall present the proposed
development project for the benefit of the Planning Board
and the public. The Planning Board shall allow oral and
written comments from the general public. All public
comments shall be made part of the public record of the
project application.
(e) Decision. The Planning Board shall, within 120 days of
certification of completeness of the master plan application as
provided in Subsection D(3)(b) of this section, or within such
further time as may be consented to by the applicant as
provided in § 450-18 of this article, approve of the master plan
as submitted, approve with changes and/or conditions, or deny
the application according to the requirements of § 450-42 of
Article XI.
(f) Failure to act. Failure of the Planning Board to act within the
period prescribed in Subsection D(3)(e) of this section shall
constitute approval of the master plan, and a certificate of the
administrative officer as to the failure of the Planning Board to
act within the required time and the resulting approval shall be
issued on request of the applicant.
(g) Expiration of master plan approval. Approval of a major land
development or major subdivision master plan shall expire one
year from the date of final approval. Vesting may be extended
for a period of one additional year for good cause shown, if
requested by the applicant in writing, and approved by the
Planning Board. The applicant, or his or her representative(s),
shall appear before the Planning Board for the annual review.
Master plan vesting shall include any applicable provisions of
the zoning ordinance that were in place at the time of approval,
conceptual layout and all conditions shown on the approved
master plan drawings and supporting materials. The initial
two-year vesting for the approved master plan shall constitute

administrative officer in Subsection D(6)(b) or (d), with the
right to extend for one year upon written request by the
applicant, who must appear before the Planning Board for the
annual review, unless, within that period, the plat or plan shall
have been submitted for signature and recording as specified
in Article VI. Thereafter, the Planning Board may, for good
cause shown, extend the period for recording for an additional
period, if requested by the applicant in writing.69
(f) Acceptance of public improvements. Signature and recording
as specified in Article VI of these regulations shall not
constitute the acceptance of ownership by the municipality of
any street or other public improvement or other land intended
for dedication. Final plan approval and recording shall not

impose any duty upon the municipality to maintain or improve
those dedicated areas until the developer has fulfilled his/her
obligations to complete said improvements in accordance with
the approved construction plans, and until the Town Council
accepts the completed public improvements as constructed
in compliance with the final construction plans. The Planning
Board shall require maintenance guarantees to be provided for
a one -year period subsequent to completion, inspection and
acceptance of the improvements, as required under Article VII
of these regulations.
A. When an applicant has exceeded a deadline established by these
regulations for submission of material for a subdivision or development
project; or recording an approved final plat or plan, thereby rendering a
previously granted approval invalid; or has requested an extension of
an approval previously granted by the Planning Board or administrative
officer prior to the actual expiration date, the application may be
reinstated by the Planning Board under the following conditions:
(1) The subdivision or development is consistent with the
Comprehensive Community Plan;
(2) The land development and subdivision regulations are substantially
the same as they were at the time of original approval;
(3) The zoning of the parcel is substantially the same as it was at the
time of original approval;
(4) Physical conditions on the parcel are substantially the same as they
were at the time of original approval;
(5) Any applicable state or federal regulations are substantially the
same as they were at the time of original approval; and
(6) Any required fee, or fee in-lieu-of is the same as it was at the time of
the original approval. The Board shall, in approving such request,
condition its approval on the payment of the current fees in effect
at the time of the granting of said extension.
B. Application for reinstatement of a previously approved subdivision or
development plan shall be made to the Planning Board in writing by the
applicant. The Planning Board, in approving or denying the request for
an extension, shall make findings of fact which shall be made part of the
record. (See Article XI, § 450-40, for applicable application fees.)

§ 450-22 CHARTER § 450-23
C:475
In addition to the requirements and procedures of this article and the
applicable checklists included as attachments to this chapter, a
conservation design development application shall also include the required
information and follow the design and review processes of this section.
The employment of a qualified design professional is required. Note that
design and review of a conservation design development is an analytical
process that relies on a knowledge and understanding of the site and its
resources and the interaction of the built environment in relation to the
landscape and its elements. Also, there will be cases where the benefit of
private ownership and use of the property exceeds the benefit of common
open space resources for the community. Therefore, evaluation and input
by experts in particular resource fields (forestry, agriculture, wildlife, etc.),
and by the West Greenwich Conservation Commission and Land Trust, is
critical to the decision-making process. Each stage of review may require
two or more meetings with the Planning Board as the design and purpose of
the development are further refined.
A. Application.
(1) Pre-application submission materials. A pre-application meeting
and review is required for all major and minor conservation design
development proposals, and shall include the following materials
and requirements, in addition to the items required for a
conventional subdivision:
(a) An existing conditions and site resources map.* See checklist
for requirements (Design Process items 1, 5).
(b) A context map of the site and its surrounding area.* See
checklist for requirements (Design Process items 2, 5).
(c) A potential conservation areas sketch plan to designate
potential conservation areas, differentiating all of the land
unsuitable for development as "primary conservation lands,"
(or, "constraints to development") and a minimum of 50% of the
remaining lands as the "secondary conservation" lands (or
"resources"), in accordance with the design process noted in
Subsection B below. (Design Process items 3, 5)
The Planning Board shall review these maps to assess
accuracy, conformance with checklist requirements, and likely
impact upon the natural and cultural resources on the
property. The Planning Board will also conduct an initial site
visit during the pre-application stage of review.
(d) A site visit. The purpose of the site visit is to understand the
property's existing conditions and special features, and to
identify potential conservation areas, developable areas, site
design issues, and areas for further study. The site walk shall
be conducted during the pre-application stage of review, after
the Planning Board members have received the existing
conditions maps and the site context map. A follow-up site visit
§ 450-23 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-23
C:476
may be required by the Board during the master plan stage of
review to verify the feasibility of the yield plan and to explore
the proposed development area and/or open space land in
greater detail.
(2) Master plan submission materials.
(a) In addition to the items required for a conventional
subdivision, the master plan application shall include the
following materials:
[1] Yield plan. The applicant shall submit a realistic
conventional subdivision master plan to determine the
maximum number of lots or units permitted in the
development. This "yield plan" shall meet the conventional
subdivision and zoning requirements (and shall not
assume that waivers will be granted). The subdivision
design shall consider all available information as required
from the pre-application and master plan checklists.
Proposed house sites shall meet the minimum suitable
land requirements and proposed road locations shall be in
areas that do not pose any physical or environmental
limitations. The Planning Board may require test pits in
areas the Board considers to be marginal. Lots shall not be
considered if an OWTS would require a variance from
RIDEM. If a formal wetlands application is necessary for
the proposed yield plan, the Board shall assume it will not
be granted by RIDEM, unless the applicant can
demonstrate otherwise with written confirmation by
RIDEM. (Design Process item 4)
[2] Conceptual layout plans. Due to the flexibility of a
conservation design subdivision, a number of layouts may
be possible. Therefore, the conservation design
development application process requires that two or
more layout options be presented to the Planning Board
for the various required map submissions. During the
process, a favored layout may become evident based on
the goals of the design and the particular features of the
site. (Design Process 3, 5, 6 and 7) (Composite Map)
[3] All plans as required during pre-application are also
required again at master plan, in greater detail, as
necessary.

§ 450-23 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-23
C:478
upon the developer and the developer's heirs, devisees,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns, which
statement shall be approved by the Planning Board and
be thereafter recorded simultaneously with the recording
of the approved final plat in the Town Clerk's office, and
which shall contain the following:
[a] That the land lies within the approved conservation
design development.
[b] That development of the land is permitted only in
accordance with the land use approved by the
Planning Board of the Town of West Greenwich.
[c] That no further development or subdivision of the
tract or lots therein shall be permitted, with the
exception of an administrative subdivision.
(b) The documents shall be recorded simultaneously with the final
plat in the Town of West Greenwich Land Evidence Records. In
addition, the developer shall give each original purchaser of a
lot in the conservation design development a copy of all such
documents.
(5) Record plan. The record plan shall contain the following
statements:
(a) "These premises are subject to restrictions, conditions,
covenants, and easements that are contained in instrument(s)
recorded simultaneously with this Final Plat in Book _____ and
Page(s) _____ of the Town of West Greenwich Land Evidence
Records, and are incorporated herein by reference."
(b) "Further subdivision of any lot as depicted on this plan,
approved by the Planning Board as a Conservation Design
Development, is prohibited in perpetuity, in accordance with
the restrictions of the Zoning Ordinance and the Land
Development and Subdivision Regulations."
B. Design process. The design of a conservation development shall be
created in accordance with the following 10 steps, as noted in the
Rhode Island Conservation Development Manual. The Planning Board
may require the applicant to submit separate plans indicating the
findings of each step in the design process, if not otherwise required by
a checklist.
(1) Analyze the site. Review the existing site conditions and features,
taking care to identify sensitive and noteworthy natural, scenic,
and cultural resources on the site, including stone walls and
significant trees. (Base Map and Existing Conditions and Site
Resources Map) (Pre-application submission, refine for master
plan)
§ 450-23 CHARTER § 450-23
C:479
(2) Evaluate site context. Identify natural and cultural resource
systems that surround the site, including the character of the
neighborhood. Identify connections to surrounding land uses and
activities, including transportation networks (roadway, bicycle, and
pedestrian), protected open space and recreational areas, and
water resources (streams, wetlands, groundwater aquifer and
recharge areas, etc.). (Context Map of Site in its Surrounding Area)
(Pre-application submission, refine for master plan)
(3) Designate potential conservation areas.
(a) Proposed conservation lands shall be designated using the
results of the above two steps. All of the land unsuitable for
development (as defined in Article III, § 450-6) shall be
designated as "primary conservation areas." "Secondary
conservation areas" shall consist of a minimum of 50% of the
suitable land, including the natural, cultural, and visual
resources identified as noteworthy during the above two steps.
Secondary conservation areas shall be prioritized in terms of
their highest to least potential for inclusion within the open
space lands, in consultation with the Planning Board, and
considering the parcel's configuration, overlapping of multiple
resources, and context in relation to adjoining resource areas.
The total conservation area requirements are the sum of
primary and secondary conservation areas, which may total
more than 50% of the land in the development. Conservation
areas shall be delineated in a manner clearly indicating their
boundaries as well as the types of resources included within
them. (Pre-application submission, refine for master plan)
(Potential Conservation Areas sketch plan, Report including
inventory of the conservation values of the property)
(b) During this step, a conservation theme or themes shall be
identified. This theme shall be identified at the time of the
initial application. Conservation themes may include, but are
not limited to, forest stewardship, water quality preservation,
farmland preservation, natural habitat preservation or
restoration, viewshed preservation, or archaeological and
historic properties preservation. The Planning Board shall
have the ability to specify which areas shall be preserved.
Advisory comments from the Conservation Commission and
Land Trust shall be considered during the selection of the open
space areas.
(4) Determine the maximum number of units. The maximum number of
units permitted in a conservation development shall be no greater
than the number of units permitted on the same parcel as would be
developed as a conventional subdivision. A yield plan shall be
submitted at the master plan stage, based on a reasonable
development scheme given the suitability of the property. The
Planning Board may require testing on individual lots, and other
§ 450-23 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-23
C:480
requirements, to prove (demonstrate) feasibility of the master plan.
(Conventional Subdivision/Yield Plan) (master plan)
(5) Locate development areas and explore conceptual alternatives.
Once the Board has approved the number of units, determine the
areas most appropriate on which to locate/develop those units by
combining the existing conditions and site resources map and the
potential conservation areas sketch plan into a composite map.
Several scenarios should be generated in order for the Planning
Board to evaluate the best alternative. The Board and the applicant
should consider optimum soils, water availability, the visual
character of the open space, the experience of visiting or living in
the community, and the context map of the site in its surrounding
area. (Composite Map, Conceptual Layout Plans) (Master Plan)
(6) Locate house sites. Potential house sites shall be tentatively located
using the composite map, or the "chosen" conceptual layout plan.
House sites should take advantage of locations providing attractive
views, privacy, and yard space, while accommodating adequate
access, drainage, and suitable locations for a well and septic
system. (Additional house siting requirements are noted in the
design requirements section.) (Master Plan, refine at preliminary
plan).
(7) Lay out streets, trails, and other infrastructure. After designating
the house sites, design a street plan to provide vehicular and
pedestrian access to each house, complying with the standards in
Article XIII, and bearing a logical relationship to topographic
conditions. Care should be taken to avoid negative effects to the
open space, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally
sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding
15%. Pedestrian walkways should be used to connect the
neighborhood, especially through areas where streets do not
connect. Show conceptual drainage locations and strategy for lowimpact
development drainage design. If applicable, a tentative
network of trails shall also be shown, connecting streets with
various natural and cultural features in the conservation land, and
potential trail connections to adjacent parcels in areas where a
connected trail network is envisioned. (Master Plan, refine at
Preliminary Plan)
(8) Design and program open space. (Preliminary Plan) Proposed uses
and design for the open space areas should be carefully planned to
take advantage of existing natural, cultural, and historical features,
and the potential for active agriculture and forestry, and active or
passive recreation. Conservation areas shall be delineated in a
manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of
resources included within them. Potential owners and/or easement
holders for the open space, if known, shall be involved in this step.
§ 450-23 CHARTER § 450-23
C:481
(9) Draw in the lot lines. After designating the open space conservation
areas and the roadway and drainage infrastructure locations, lot
lines can be drawn to delineate the boundaries of individual
residential lots within the areas designated for development. Each
lot shall conform to the dimensional requirements of Chapter 400,
Zoning, of the Town Code for a conservation development, and the
lot design standards of Article XIII, § 450-57, of these regulations.
(Preliminary Plan)
(10) Establish ownership and management of open space and other
shared amenities. (Preliminary Plan, refine at Final Plan) Proposed
ownership shall be determined for the various aspects of the open
space, and initial comments shall be submitted to the Planning
Board regarding the desirability of the land to the potential
owner(s). An open space use, maintenance, and operations plan
detailing the entities responsible for maintaining various elements
of the property and describing management objectives and
techniques for each part of the property shall be drafted for the
preliminary review stage, and finalized for the final plan. Such
management plans shall be consistent with the requirements of
Article XIII, § 450-58.

A. General. For all changes to the approved plans of land development
projects or subdivisions subject to these regulations, an amendment of
the final development plans shall be required prior to the issuance of
any building permits for construction upon the subject property. Any
changes approved to the final plan shall be recorded as amendments to
the final plan in accordance with the procedure established for
recording of plats and plans as provided in § 450-24 of this article,
above.
B. Minor changes.
(1) Minor changes to a land development or subdivision plan shall be
approved administratively by the administrative officer. The
administrative officer may, at his/her discretion, authorize such
changes without review and approval of the Planning Board and
without a public hearing thereon. All such changes shall be made a
part of the permanent record of the project application. This
provision shall not prohibit the administrative officer from
requesting a recommendation from the Planning Board. Denial of
the proposed change(s) by the administrative officer shall be
referred to the Planning Board for review as a major change
according to the procedure provided in Subsection C below. Upon
written authorization of the approval of a minor change by the
administrative officer, the Building Official may issue a building
permit for any proposed construction upon the subject property.
(2) For the purpose of these regulations, the term "minor change" shall
mean any change which, in the opinion of the administrative officer,
is consistent with the intent of the original approval. Such minor
§ 450-24 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-25
C:484
changes shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
following:
(a) Amendments to utility plans which are acceptable to the

Supervisor and which do not require approval of any state or
federal reviewing authorities;
(d) Amendments to construction plans which are required because
of unforeseen physical conditions on the parcel being
subdivided;
(e) Modifications to any construction plans for off-site
improvements which are acceptable to the Director of Public
Works or Highway Supervisor; or
(f) Modifications which are required by outside permitting
agencies such as, but not limited to, the Department of
Environmental Management and the Department of
Transportation.
C. Major changes.
(1) Major changes to a land development or subdivision plan may be
approved only by the Planning Board. The procedure for approval
of any such major changes shall follow the same review and public
hearing process as required for preliminary approval of a major
land development and major subdivision as provided in Article V,
§ 450-19D(4).
(2) For the purpose of these regulations, the term "major changes"
shall mean changes which, in the opinion of the administrative
officer, are clearly contrary to the intent of the original approval.
Such major changes shall include, but are not necessarily limited
to, the following:
(a) Changes which would have the effect of creating additional lots
or dwelling units for development;
(b) Changes which would be contrary to any applicable provision
of Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code or which require a

regulations or as a condition of approval of the Planning Board shall be
completed in compliance with the approved plans and specifications.
B. Improvement guarantees shall be provided to ensure the proper
installation and maintenance of required street, utility and other
physical improvements and to ensure compliance with other conditions
of preliminary plan approval.
A. Before any land development or subdivision plan is endorsed by the
Planning Board, and before the recording of any subdivision plats, the
Planning Board shall be required to approve agreements for the
completion of all required improvements. Such agreements may, at the
option of the developer, take the form of:
(1) Completion of actual construction of all improvements;
(2) Completion of actual construction of all improvements, with the
exception of those improvements provided in § 450-28A below
which shall require improvement guarantees; or
(3) A combination thereof.
B. At the preliminary plan review stage, the developer shall submit a cost
estimate for all required improvements and either of the following: 1) a
letter to the Planning Board indicating his/her intent to complete the
required improvements prior to the Planning Board's endorsement of
the final plat; or 2) a letter to the Board indicating his/her intent to
complete the required improvements prior to the Planning Board's
endorsement of the final plat, with cash security sufficient to cover the
cost of required improvements provided in § 450-28A at an amount
established by the Board.
(1) If all improvements are to be constructed without a financial
guarantee, all work, including Mylar as-built record drawings
certified by a professional engineer or professional land surveyor
licensed by the State of Rhode Island, shall be completed prior to
endorsement and recording. Inspections shall be made by the Town
at all required stages of construction as specified in Article XIV. All

request. The final plat shall be endorsed by the appropriate
Planning Board or Town official and the plan shall be recorded,
at which time the lots within the subdivision may be transferred
or sold, or the nonresidential buildings may receive certificates of
occupancy.
(2) If improvements are to be guaranteed, the provisions of § 450-28
shall apply.
A. Required improvements and amounts; completion of improvements.
(1) Improvement guarantees shall be considered for the following
subdivision or development improvements only:
(a) Final asphalt or other approved paving surface;
(b) Sidewalks;

necessary conditions (including but not limited to construction
specifications, drawings, engineering, requests for proposals and
permitting) to secure for the Town the actual construction and
complete installation of said required improvements, and the
satisfactory completion of all conditions of final approval within the
time periods required for completion. The amount shall be based
upon actual cost estimates which would be required for the Town to
complete all improvements required as a condition of final
approval. These estimates shall be initially prepared by the
applicant and submitted to the administrative officer, who shall
review the estimates in consultation with the Town's engineer. The
Planning Board shall review the amount of the improvement
guarantee and approve the final amount. The Board may set the
guarantee in a reasonable amount in excess of the estimated costs
in order to anticipate for increases in economic or construction
conditions, administrative and enforcement costs. However, the
amount of such increase shall not exceed 150% of the estimated
cost of improvements.
§ 450-27 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-28
C:488
(3) All work, with the exception of items in Subsection A(1)(a) through
(e) above, shall be completed prior to endorsement and recording
of the final plat. Progress Mylar as-built record drawings certified
by a professional engineer and/or land surveyor licensed by the
State of Rhode Island and depicting all improvements, with the
exception of final asphalt paving surface, sidewalks, and right-ofway
plantings, where applicable, shall also be completed prior to
endorsement and recording. Inspections shall be made by the Town
at all required stages of construction as specified in Article XIV. All
construction shall be inspected and approved under the direction of
the administrative officer and according to the procedures in
Article XIV. Upon completion of all required improvements, the
administrative officer shall certify in writing such completion, and a
copy shall be provided to the developer upon request. The final plat
shall be endorsed by the appropriate Planning Board or Town
official and the plan shall be recorded, at which time the lots within
the subdivision may be transferred or sold, or the nonresidential
buildings may receive certificates of occupancy.
(4) At the expiration of preliminary plan approval period, if all required
improvements are not complete, the Planning Board shall review
the status of improvements and may:
(a) Require the developer to extend the duration of the entire
improvement guarantee; or
(b) Authorize the administrative officer to take the steps necessary
to ensure completion of the remaining work by using
improvement guarantee funds and/or enforce preliminary plan
approval.
(5) If at any time during the guarantee period the procedures,
implementation measures, methods, materials, and/or schedules of
construction are determined by the Planning Board not to be in
compliance with the approved plans, the Board may, after proper
notification to the developer, authorize the use of improvement
guarantee funds to ensure proper compliance.
B. Required form. The security shall be in the form of a cash deposit in an
escrow account with a bank in the name of the "Town of West
Greenwich." No other forms of security shall be authorized.
C. Releases. When all required improvements are complete, the
improvement guarantee shall be returned to the developer. A written
request for release of any improvement guarantee shall be made to the
administrative officer, who shall refer such request to the Planning
Board. After inspection of all required improvements, the Planning
Board shall 1) authorize the return of all improvement guarantees to
the developer, or 2) order that no releases be made. Partial releases or
reductions in the guarantee amount shall not be authorized.
§ 450-28 CHARTER § 450-28
C:489
D. Phased subdivisions. In the case of land development projects or
subdivisions which are approved and constructed in phases, the
Planning Board shall specify improvement guarantees related to each
particular phase. If any off-site improvements or other improvements or
conditions which are not directly related to a particular phase are
required as a condition of approval, the Board shall, in setting the
guarantee amount for each phase, clearly specify when such
guarantees are to be provided.
E. Maintenance guarantees (for public and private improvements).
(1) The Planning Board shall require that a cash maintenance
guarantee be provided by the developer for all improvements
which will be dedicated to the Town for public acceptance and
maintenance at the time of recording the final plat. For multifamily
and nonresidential developments, the Planning Board shall require
a two-year maintenance bond for all drainage infrastructure,
required landscaping, and erosion control measures upon issuance
of a certificate of occupancy. The amount of the maintenance
guarantee shall be 15% of the total cost of construction.
(2) The initial period for such maintenance guarantee shall be one year
and shall commence upon completion of all development
improvements, whether or not bonded; and receipt of Mylar asbuilt
record drawings certified by a professional engineer and/or
land surveyor licensed by the State of Rhode Island. At the end of
the one-year maintenance period, the Director of Public Works and
Highways shall inspect all improvements proposed for dedication
to the Town subject to the guarantee and shall certify in writing to
the administrative officer as to their condition. If public
improvements are in good condition and have not been damaged,
the maintenance guarantee shall be returned to the developer
when the improvements are accepted by the Town. The Town's
consulting engineer and/or Building Official shall inspect all
multifamily and nonresidential improvements. If such privately
owned public improvements are in good condition, the
maintenance guarantee shall be returned to the developer.
(3) During the maintenance period, the applicant shall remain
responsible for all maintenance of the public improvements.
(4) If, upon inspection by the Director of Public Works and Highways or
the Building Official, improvements subject to a maintenance
guarantee are found to be unacceptable, the administrative officer
shall refer the matter to the Planning Board. The Planning Board
shall review the condition of the improvements and may 1) require
the developer to extend the duration of the maintenance
guarantee; or 2) authorize the administrative officer to take the
steps necessary to ensure completion of the remaining work by
using maintenance guarantee funds and/or bring appropriate
action to ensure the acceptable completion and/or repairs of the
§ 450-28 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-28
C:490
improvements. During house construction, the developer shall take
all steps necessary to ensure that the upkeep and performance of
the public improvements are maintained in good condition.
(5) In cases where the Planning Board finds there are extenuating
circumstances, the initial maintenance period may be established
for a period longer than one year. The reasons for establishing a
longer maintenance period and the nature of the extenuating
circumstances shall be made a part of the record.
F. Acceptance of improvements.
(1) Upon completion of all required improvements and following the
release of the maintenance bond for the public improvements, the
developer shall convey all public improvements to the Town for
ownership and maintenance. Private facilities, such as private
roads, open space and privately maintained drainage systems shall
not be conveyed to the Town. The applicant shall first request a
final inspection as provided in Article XIV. The Town's engineer
shall certify to the administrative officer in writing that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed.
(2) The applicant shall also request, in writing to the administrative
officer, that public improvements, streets, land, easements or other
facilities be accepted by the Town. This request shall contain a
description of all facilities to be accepted and shall be accompanied
by an accurate description of all streets, easements, land or other
facilities by metes and bounds and by reference to the final plat
drawing(s) and by a warranty deed transferring ownership to the
Town and describing any special conditions or other requirements.
The Planning Board shall require these signed documents to be
submitted as part of the final plan application, for recording after
acceptance by the Town Council.
(3) Upon certification of completion of all required improvements, and
upon receipt of all required information from the applicant, the
administrative officer shall place the request for acceptance upon
the next available agenda of the Planning Board. If all requirements
of these regulations have been met by the applicant, the Planning
Board shall recommend acceptance by the Town Council of all such
improvements and shall transmit such recommendation to the
Town Council in writing.
(4) Upon their acceptance by the Town Council, and following the
required one-year maintenance guarantee period, all
improvements shall be permanently owned and maintained by the
Town as part of the municipal system and the developer shall be no
longer responsible for their care, repair, or maintenance.

Waivers and Modifications
§ 450-29. Waiver of development plan review.
§ 450-30. Waiver or modification of regulations.
A. The Planning Board may waive requirements for development plan
review where there is a change in use or occupancy and no extensive
construction of improvements is sought. The waiver may be granted

land contained in the subdivision or development greater than those
required by Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code or these
regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto may be required to
be indicated on the recorded plan, or the Planning Board may require
that restrictive covenants be recorded with the Town Clerk.
C. Suitability of land.
(1) Land deemed unsuitable for development purposes by the Planning
Board following consultation with the Rhode Island Department of
Environmental Management, and following a determination by the
Planning Board that the proposed subdivision or use of the land
would result in a violation of federal, state or local environmental,
land use or other applicable laws, will not be approved for
subdivision or development.
§ 450-46 CHARTER § 450-46
C:511
§ 450-47. Street design standards.
The following design standards shall be followed where applicable in the
design and construction of any subdivision or development:
(2) No freshwater wetlands as defined in Chapter 213 of the Public
Laws of 1971 (R.I.G.L. § 2-1-18 et seq.), relating to freshwater
wetlands, shall be excavated, drained or filled, nor shall any
extraneous materials be placed into these wetlands. Water flow
shall not be diverted nor shall any change be made to the natural
condition of the wetland without the prior approval of the Director
of the State Department of Environmental Management and the
West Greenwich Town Council in accordance with the provisions of
said chapter, specifically R.I.G.L. §§ 2-1-21(a) and 2-1-22.
(3) No subdivision or development plan shall be approved by the
Planning Board if the stormwater management plan (sedimentation
and erosion control and stormwater mitigation) submitted by the
applicant does not contain information sufficient in detail and
extent to meet the requirements of these regulations, nor shall any
stormwater management plan be approved which does not adhere
to the design standards specified in these regulations. Land which
cannot be developed without substantial adverse effects to the
water quality and natural functions of the proposed development
site and surrounding area shall not be approved for development or
subdivision.
A. Frontage on improved streets.
(1) With the exception of residential compound projects, the area to be
subdivided shall have a minimum of 50 feet of frontage on and
access from an existing improved public street. If such an existing
street has not been improved to the standards and specifications as
required in these regulations, the Board may require the subdivider
to make certain improvements along the street abutting the
property or leading to the property being subdivided where
necessary for drainage, safety, traffic or other reasons as deemed
proper by the Board. See § 450-54, Off-site improvements, of this
article.
(2) For purposes of these regulations, streets platted but not improved
or accepted for maintenance by the Town shall not be considered to
be existing improved public streets. Where these streets are
incorporated within the subdivision, they shall be improved by the
developer to meet the subdivision regulations standards.
B. Street classification.
(1) Street design within a proposed subdivision or development shall
conform to a street hierarchy system as established herein.
Requirements for right-of-way and pavement width, on-street
§ 450-46 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-47
C:512
parking, drainage and other utilities, sidewalks, bicycle paths and
other design standards shall be tailored to street function.
(2) The following major categories of street classification are
established:
(a) Arterial: a major public street that serves as an avenue for the
circulation of traffic into, out of, or around the Town and
carries high volumes of traffic and provides for high levels of
mobility.
(b) Collector: a public street whose principal function is to carry
traffic between local streets and arterial streets but that may
also provide direct access to abutting properties. These streets
provide a balance between land access and mobility.
(c) Local public: public streets whose primary function is to
provide access to abutting properties.
(d) Minimum-maintenance road: a Town road that does not
provide physical access to dwellings and is deemed unsuitable
for development by the Planning Board, but may provide
access for emergency vehicles. A minimum-maintenance road
shall be reclassified to an accepted Town road upon the
initiation of improvements to service said dwellings.81
(e) Town road (accepted): public roads that meet minimum Town
or subdivision standards and are maintained by the Town.
(f) Private road: those privately owned and maintained roads that
do not meet current Town or subdivision standards. Approved
subdivision roads with work in progress shall be considered
private roads until acceptance by the Town. The creation of
new private roads or private rights-of-way in the Town shall not
be permitted, except as allowed in residential compounds, as
regulated in Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code; or as
allowed in commercial or multifamily land development
projects. As a condition of final approval, the subdivider shall
be required to record a covenant, binding on his successors
and assigns, that the Town of West Greenwich shall not be
asked or required to accept or maintain the private streets and
minimum maintenance roads within the parcel that do not
meet the engineering and design requirements for Townaccepted
streets. (See Subsection K of this section.)
(g) Paper street: those roads shown on proposed subdivision plans
or Tax Assessor Plat Maps that do not physically exist.
(h) Access or service road/private common driveway: a common
private driveway used to access residential lots where access
81.Editor's Note: Amended at time of codification.
§ 450-47 CHARTER § 450-47
C:513
from the frontage on a collector or arterial road has been
restricted or limited by the Planning Board in order to reduce
curb cuts on collector and arterial streets.
C. Access to subdivision/development. Wherever the area to be subdivided
or developed is to obtain access or have frontage on Town-maintained
roads which are inadequate in improvement and width to handle the
volume of traffic which will be generated by the subdivision or
development, the applicant, at his or her own expense, shall be
required to improve such access roads to the extent that they are
capable of providing safe access to the subdivision or development as
determined by the Planning Board. The Planning Board may require
that a performance bond be secured, or require that approval of the
final plan be conditional upon completion of improvements to access
roads. (See Article VII of these regulations.)
D. Topography and arrangement.
(1) Street layout shall be considered in relation to the existing street
system and shall conform to the West Greenwich Comprehensive
Community Plan. Limited access to major highways may be
required for safety purposes.
(2) Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local
roads shall be curved wherever possible to avoid uniformity of lot
appearance. Street alignment shall follow natural terrain, and no
unnecessary cuts or fills shall be allowed in order to create
additional lots or building sites. Combinations of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided.82
(3) The use of gridiron street patterns or similar designs will not be
permitted. The use of curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac, or P- or Ushaped
streets (loop roads) shall be encouraged where such use
will result in a more desirable layout. P- or U-shaped roads
facilitate the design for through circulation patterns that eliminate
the need for excess cul-de-sac or dead-end street layouts.
(4) All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
churches, and shopping centers, to population densities, and to the
pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
(5) New subdivision roads shall be laid out to encourage connectivity;
to discourage culs-de-sac, isolated neighborhoods, and use by
through traffic; to permit efficient drainage and utility systems; and
to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide
convenient circulation and safe access to property.
(6) If connection to adjacent undeveloped property is desired, the
Planning Board may require the applicant to show a future
82.Editor's Note: Amended at time of codification.
§ 450-47 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-47
C:514
connection to the property line as part of the right-of-way dedicated
to the Town. The Board's intent in residential districts is to provide
street access for any abutting "landlocked" parcels.
(7) Major subdivisions or land development projects may be required
to provide an emergency access as determined by the Planning
Board with input from the local Fire Chief.
(8) Neighborhood streets may take the form of a two-way street, or a
one-way loop street around a small neighborhood green.
E. Dead-end streets (culs-de-sac) and blocks.
(1) In residential subdivisions, blocks and cul-de-sac streets (or dead
ends) shall not be longer than 1,200 feet.
(2) Dead-end streets which cannot be extended, or connected to form a
looped road, in the judgment of the Planning Board shall have at
their closed end a turnaround with a minimum outside curb radius
of 60 feet, and an intersection approach radii of 30 feet.
Modifications to the design shall be subject to the review and
recommendation of the Highway Supervisor on a case-by-case
basis.
(3) Where a dead-end street is to provide access to adjacent property,
the Planning Board may require provision for a temporary
turnaround or "tee" until such time as the adjacent tract is
developed and the street extended. Temporary "tees" or culs-de-sac
shall be conveyed with a defeasible easement for the portion of the
right-of-way and pavement to be removed when the street is
extended.
(4) For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent and temporary dead-end streets shall be
limited in length as determined by the Planning Board, not to
exceed 1,200 feet.
F. Access to arterial streets.
(1) The Planning Board may require additional right-of-way and
pavement width for arterial streets subject to heavy traffic.
(2) Where a subdivision or development borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial road, no access shall be provided to
individual lots or units from the arterial road and screening shall be
provided in a strip of land along the rear property line of such lots.
The width of such buffers shall be determined by the Planning
Board.
G. Street names. An extension of an existing street or road shall have the
same name as the existing street or road. Names of other proposed
streets shall be substantially different from any existing street name in
the Town of West Greenwich, and approved by the Planning Board.
§ 450-47 CHARTER § 450-47
C:515
Preference shall be given to street names incorporating references to
West Greenwich's history and persons within that history.83
H. Street regulatory signs. The developer or Highway Supervisor shall
install all required and approved road signs, at the expense of the
developer and approved by the Director of Public Works or Highway
Supervisor. Street name signs with sufficient supports and of a type
acceptable to the Director of Public Works or Highway Supervisor are
to be placed at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision.
Dead-end streets shall be clearly indicated as such at their entrance.
The developer shall deposit with the Town of West Greenwich at the
time of final application a sum as set from time to time by the Town
Council for each road sign as part of the subdivision approval.84
I. Shade trees. Shade trees shall be required along both sides of the
street; consideration to proximity to utilities shall be given. Where
feasible, existing trees shall be conserved. The developer is to present
the Planning Board with a landscape plan, as required in § 450-49 of
this article, including, but not limited to, drawings which indicate the
method to be used to safeguard existing trees, within the fifty-foot
right-of-way, during construction of the street. The intent of this plan is
to prevent premature death to existing trees caused by scarring,
backfilling, root cutting, changing of grades and any other damaging
act. Additional trees shall be planted out at intervals no closer than 30
feet nor farther than 50 feet, measured between trunks, except that
trees shall not be located within 30 feet of intersecting right-of-way
lines. The species and size of such trees must be approved by the
Planning Board as part of the approval for a preliminary plan. The
developer shall plant street trees appropriate for the terrain, soil, and
climactic conditions encountered in the subdivision or development.
Native species are preferred.
J. Design standards.
(1) General. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width,
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access to police, fire-fighting, snow removal, and road
maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose
a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining
properties, the following design standards for roads are hereby
required.
(2) Street surfacing and improvements. Streets shall be graded,
graveled and paved at the expense of the developer in accordance
with the requirements of this section and the construction
specifications indicated in Figure 1.85
83.Editor's Note: See also Ch. 151, Buildings and Lots, Numbering of.

§ 450-47 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-47
C:516
(3) Intersections.
(a) Street center lines shall coincide precisely at intersections or
shall be offset at least 150 feet.
(b) Street center lines shall intersect as nearly at right angles as
practicable. No intersections shall contain an angle of less than
60°.
(c) Corners at intersections shall be rounded to provide curb radii
of not less than 25 feet.
(d) Intersections shall be designed on a flat grade wherever
possible.
(e) All street intersections shall be designed to provide proper
sight distance as set forth by the AASHTO Policy on Geometric
Design of Highways and Streets, latest revisions.
(4) Street surfacing and improvements.
(a) Streets and rights-of-way, both existing and proposed, shall be
continued with at least the same width through the
subdivision.
(b) Street rights-of-way may not be less than 50 feet in width.
Street pavements may not be less than (24 feet to 26 feet) in
width, measured between curbs and centered between street
lines. The Planning Board may permit a local street to have a
street pavement of not less than 20 feet in width, measured
between curbs and centered between street lines. (Residential
compound road standards are contained in Chapter 400,
Zoning, of the Town Code.)
(c) The Planning Board shall take into account drainage
requirements to determine the location and extent of Cape Cod
berm placement and/or curbing to be utilized in a proposed
subdivision.
(d) Grades of local streets shall not be less than 0.5% nor more
than 8%. Collector streets shall not exceed 7% in grade nor be
less than 0.5% in grade.
(e) Where a deflection angle of 10° or more occurs along a center
line of a street, a horizontal curve with a radius of not less than
150 feet shall be introduced.
(f) Where changes in grade are encountered in the street center
line profile, vertical curves shall be introduced which provide
proper sight distance, as determined by the AASHTO Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, latest revision.
§ 450-47 CHARTER § 450-47
C:517
K. Existing minimum-maintenance roads. Existing minimum-maintenance
roads shall be permitted according to the following:
(1) Existing minimum-maintenance roads, as defined herein, shall have
a minimum right-of-way of 40 feet in width, and a minimum twentyfoot
travel way.
(2) Any subdivision of property occurring along existing minimummaintenance
roads or unpaved Town-owned roads shall require
improvements that meet the satisfaction of the Director of Public
Works or Highway Supervisor and the Planning Board while
adhering to the following minimum design standards:
(a) Right-of-way: 50 feet.
(b) Roadway width: 24 feet (gravel or paved, based on surrounding
land use evaluation).
(c) Gravel base: minimum of 12 inches.
L. Access to adjoining property. When considered desirable by the
Planning Board to provide access to adjoining property, proposed
streets shall be continued and improved to the property line (and
street) only if an adjoining street already exists. The reservation of
strips of land preventing such access shall not be permitted. The
Planning Board may require provision of a temporary turnaround or the
dedication of the right-of-way to the abutting property line as a stub,
until such time as the adjacent tract is developed. An improvement
guarantee may be required to ensure completion of the street or
construction of a permanent cul-de-sac within a reasonable period of
time. Access to adjoining property for pedestrian and/or bicycle
circulation shall be required wherever the Planning Board determines
that such connection will increase accessibility between adjoining
subdivisions, to existing or proposed sidewalks or bicycle paths, from
subdivisions to major public or private schools, recreation areas or
other facilities or where the public safety will be significantly enhanced
by such pedestrian and/or bicycle connections.
M. Streetlighting. In all new subdivisions where utilities are being
installed, provisions shall be made for streetlighting connections only
where required by the Director of Public Works, Highway Supervisor, or
the Planning Board, and must be shown on final "as-built" plans.
N. Monuments. Monuments (granite-only bounds, four inches by four
inches by 30 inches long) shall be paid for by the developer and placed
by a professional land surveyor, or his/her charge, on the street line at
the beginning and end of all horizontal curves on both sides of each
subdivision (public) street and shall not be more than 500 feet apart.
Monuments shall be set four inches above finished grade of the center
of the street.
§ 450-47 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-47
C:518
O. Sidewalks. Sidewalks may be required by the Board to be installed as
off-site improvements in accordance with the provisions of § 450-54,
Off-site improvements, of this article.
(1) Sidewalks may be required to be installed along new streets at
intersections or other areas of new subdivisions and land
development projects, including multifamily development
proposals, at the discretion of the Planning Board.
(2) Sidewalks may also be required to be installed as off-site
improvements in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV.
Trails or footpaths may be required in any proposed development
in addition to required sidewalks to provide pedestrian access onsite
as well as off-site to ensure access to adjoining or nearby
neighborhoods, open spaces, or major recreational facilities.
(3) Sidewalks may be required to be installed along new streets and as
an off-site improvement if the Planning Board finds any of the
following:
(a) The subdivision or land development project is located within
an area that is within one mile of a public or private school; or
(b) The subdivision or land development project is located in
reasonable proximity to major public or private facilities such
as churches, shopping areas, playgrounds, state parks, and the
like, where there is a reasonable likelihood that pedestrian
traffic to/from/within the proposed development would result;
or
(c) The subdivision or land development project is located within
an area with high vehicular traffic volumes and where there
would be a likelihood of significant danger to pedestrians; or
(d) A sidewalk is necessary to provide pedestrian access between
groupings of dwellings or commercial establishments within
the subdivision or land development project, or to provide
access between dwellings, commercial establishments, and
recreational facilities; or
(e) An existing sidewalk abuts the proposed subdivision or land
development project; or
(f) A sidewalk will encourage pedestrian circulation and promote
public safety and health.
P. Bicycle paths. Bicycle paths may be incorporated into the proposed
subdivision or development where necessary to extend an existing
bicycle path; to intersect with proposed state bicycle facilities; to
connect adjacent developments where vehicular connections would be
impractical; or where adjacent or nearby public or private school,
§ 450-47 CHARTER § 450-47
C:519
§ 450-48. Lot design standards.
recreation areas or other similar facilities would be likely to generate
significant bicycle traffic.
Q. Curbing at intersection fillet curves. Curbing may be required to be
installed along new streets at intersections or other areas of new
subdivisions at the discretion of the Planning Board, in accordance with
the provisions of Article XIV.
R. Mailboxes. The use of common mailbox locations may be required on
public culs-de-sac, at the discretion of the Highway Superintendent.
Mailboxes for private roads and ways shall be located at the entrance to
the private road for access from a public street.
A. Lot dimensions.
(1) All lots shall conform to the dimensional requirements of Chapter
400, Zoning, of the Town Code established for the district within
which the subdivision is located.
(2) The minimum lot dimensions established by Chapter 400, Zoning,
may be increased by the Planning Board if the report of the Chief,
Rhode Island Division of Groundwater and ISDS, Rhode Island
Department of Environmental Management indicates that larger
lot dimensions are needed for the safe and effective operation of
individual sewage disposal systems, or to comply with the local
two-hundred-foot ISDS setback from a water body. Lots in areas
where public water is not available shall be of such area, shape,
and dimensions as will allow the operation of individual sewage
disposal systems in such a manner that the water supplies of said
lots and all surrounding lots are adequately safeguarded.
B. Lot configurations and setbacks.
(1) Shape/Configuration. Lots shall be generally rectangular in their
configuration. Long or narrow strips of land shall be avoided.
Irregularly or odd shaped lots such as "flag lots," "hockey sticks" or
any lot whose building envelope is isolated from its frontage shall
not be permitted.
(2) Side lot lines shall be within 15° of perpendicular with street lines
or radial to curved street lines unless the Planning Board
determines that a variation from this rule will provide a better
street or lot plan.
(3) Minimum lot width. Lots shall maintain a minimum width of 150
feet for a distance of 200 feet from the front property line, and a
minimum width of 100 feet to the rear property line. The minimum
width shall be measured parallel to the frontage line if tangent, or
the chord, if on a curve.
§ 450-47 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-48
C:520
(4) Except on those sides bordering a street, lots shall have no interior
angles of more than 200°, unless otherwise allowed by the Planning
Board.
(5) Building setback lines shall be established for all lots, as required
by Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code, and such lines shall run
parallel to the street right-of-way, all lot lines, front, rear, and side.
C. Lot frontage and access.
(1) All lots shall abut an existing or a proposed public street.
(2) Each proposed lot shall have frontage on a public street that meets
or exceeds the minimum requirements of Chapter 400, Zoning, of
the Town Code for the zone in which it is located.
(3) Frontage shall be usable for physical access to the lot from the
street. Frontage that cannot function as an access point to the
buildable envelope of the lot shall not be permitted.
(4) The lot must be accessible by the Fire Department, Police
Department and other agencies charged with protection of the
public peace, safety and welfare.
(5) Other than at corners, lots shall abut only one existing or proposed
street.
(6) Corner lot street lines shall be of sufficient length to accommodate
required front building setback lines.
(7) Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from an arterial
or collector street, as defined herein.
(8) The Planning Board may modify or relocate the location of the
proposed access driveway along the road frontage, and may modify
or limit the proposed number of access driveways onto any street
from any lot or group of lots.
(9) Provisions may be made for ensuring adequate sight distances from
the proposed access driveway along adjacent public streets in
order to alleviate any potentially hazardous situation.
(10) Internal access streets. For lots proposed along existing collector
or arterial roads, the Planning Board may require the applicant to
submit appropriate alternative plans to demonstrate the feasibility
of creating an internal access street, or a conventional subdivision.
If the Planning Board determines that such an alternative
development is feasible, practical and preferable, the creation of
frontage lots shall be prohibited, and the applicant shall be
required to develop the property in an approved alternative
fashion.
§ 450-48 CHARTER § 450-48
C:521
§ 450-49. Landscaping standards.
(11) Easements may be required to be granted to the Town to prohibit
individual driveway access from lots onto frontage streets if
adequate provision is made for access from individual lots to
service roads or internal access streets.
(12) Provisions may be made for incorporating proposed frontage lots
into future subdivision of contiguous land, if such future
subdivision is determined to be feasible by the Planning Board.
Temporary driveways and easements may be required to provide
for access to future streets in subdivisions of contiguous land. The
Planning Board may require a concept plan to indicate future
access to and development of residual land contiguous to frontage
lots.
D. Minimum buildable area.
(1) All lots shall be designed so as to contain the minimum land area
required by Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code, exclusive of
land unsuitable for development as defined in § 450-6.
(2) The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits on all lots in compliance with Chapter
400, Zoning, of the Town Code and regulations of the Department
of Environmental Management, and in providing the necessary
frontage and access to such lots from an existing or proposed
street.
(3) The slope of land shall not be excluded from the calculation of the
buildable lot area or the minimum lot size, or in the calculation of
the number of buildable lots or units (R.I.G.L. § 45-23-44).86
E. Potential for further subdivision/development. The Planning Board shall
consider whether the parcel being subdivided or developed has the
potential for further subdivision or development under current
applicable zoning regulations. If it has such potential, the Planning
Board shall consider the impacts from such future development in its
review of the proposed subdivision or development and may impose any
or all of the site design standards provided in § 450-53 below, as
necessary to mitigate such impacts.
A. Landscaping shall be provided as part of all development and
subdivision designs. See § 450-53, Site design, Subsections E(2)(j) and
G, below, for additional landscape design requirements. It shall be
conceived in a total pattern throughout the site, integrating the various
elements of site design, preserving and enhancing the particular
identity of the site and creating a pleasing site character. The type and
86.Editor's Note: Added at time of codification.
§ 450-48 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-49
C:522
amount of landscaping required shall be allowed to vary with the
type of development, as reasonably determined by the Planning Board,
or as otherwise required by these land development and subdivision
regulations or Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code. Water-efficient
landscaping and drought-resistant native species are strongly
encouraged.
B. Landscaping may include plant materials such as trees, shrubs, ground
covers, grass, flowers, etc., but may also include other materials such
as rocks, wetlands, stone walls, paving materials, planters, signage, and
street furniture. Areas which may be required to provide landscaping
shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
(1) Drainage facilities, such as retention/detention basins, or drainage
swales.
(2) Entrance features, considering visibility and sight lines.
(3) Open space areas.
(4) Proposed recreation facilities.
(5) Buffer areas. [Refer to § 450-51, Buffer areas, below, and § 450-53,
Site design, Subsection E(2)(i), On-site parking and circulation, and
Subsection H(3) below.]

Subsection I, Shade trees, above; and § 450-53, Site design,
Subsection H(3), below.]
(7) Lot areas which are disturbed during the construction process or
where extensive grading removes a significant amount of natural
vegetation.
(8) Areas subject to regrading or stabilization for soil erosion and
sediment control purposes.
(9) Around buildings. [Refer to § 450-53, Site design, Subsection
E(2)(i), On-site parking and circulation.]
(10) Parking lots. [Refer to § 450-53, Site design, Subsection E(2)(i), Onsite
parking and circulation.]
C. Landscape plan.
(1) A landscape plan prepared by a registered landscape architect
shall be submitted to the Planning Board unless the Board
determines that existing landscaping is sufficient or a landscape
plan is not necessary. The plan shall identify existing and proposed
trees, shrubs and ground covers; natural features such as stone
walls and rock outcroppings; man-made elements such as retaining
walls, fences, signs, planters, etc.; proposed grading at two-foot
contour intervals; lighting; specifications for loaming, fertilizing
§ 450-49 CHARTER § 450-49
C:523
and seeding; and other proposed landscaping elements. The plan
shall indicate the location of all proposed landscaping and shall
include construction details as necessary.87
(2) A planting schedule shall be included to indicate proposed planting
by species, size at time of planting, and maintenance requirements.
Where existing plantings are to be retained, the plan shall indicate
proposed methods of protecting them during construction.
D. Specifications. The following specifications shall apply for minimum
plant measurements, variety, installation techniques and maintenance:
(1) Minimum branching height for all shade trees shall be six feet.
(2) Minimum size for shade trees shall be between 2 1/2 inches and
three inches in caliper measured one foot from ground level in
place [or two inches in caliper measured at breast height (dbh)],
and 12 feet to 14 feet in height.
(3) Minimum size for evergreen trees shall be between six feet and
eight feet in height.
(4) Bare-root stock shall not be permitted.
(5) A professional horticulturist/nurseryman shall be consulted to
determine the proper time to move and install plant material so
that stress to the plant is minimized. Planting of deciduous material
may be continued during winter months, provided there is no frost
in the ground and frost-free topsoil planting mixtures are used.
(6) A landscape contractor shall be employed to perform all

having adequate density, height and type of vegetation, in order to
provide an all-season visual and audio screen, or to block light or
other nuisances, between the proposed development and adjacent
land uses. Structures and off-street parking and loading and
storage areas shall not be permitted in any buffer area.
(2) This buffer may be provided in the form of a no-cut easement on the
proposed property, and the Planning Board may require additional
plantings and/or berms or fencing. Where such easements are
located on privately owned lots, they shall not be counted toward
the minimum required open space area.
(3) The width of the required buffer shall be as follows:
(a) At least 50 feet between residential land uses;
(b) At least 100 feet between industrial or commercial land
development projects and residential zone boundaries;

easement buffer for streams and vernal pools in order to protect
the Town's natural resources and to enhance greenway corridors.
C. Wetland buffers, as defined in R.I.G.L. § 2-1-20, shall be included in the
calculation of a minimum lot area and in the total number of square feet
or acres of a tract or parcel of land before calculating the maximum
potential number of units or lots for development; provided, however,
that this subsection shall not apply to lots directly abutting surface
reservoirs with direct withdrawals used for public drinking water.
Nothing herein changes the definition and applicability of a "buildable
lot" as set forth under R.I.G.L. § 45-23-60(a)(4); and nothing herein
permits the disturbance of wetlands or wetland buffers or otherwise
alters the provisions of the Freshwater Wetlands Act (R.I.G.L. § 2-1-18
et seq.).90

employing the designated nonstructural SEC measure or
measures throughout the course of the project.
(4) Responsibility for SEC measures.
(a) The owner/developer of a land development project shall be
ultimately and solely responsible for the implementation and
appropriate maintenance of all SEC measures throughout the
duration of a land development project.
(b) In the event of a failure for any reason of any SEC measures
which results in the erosion of land and/or sedimentation of an
area, the owner/developer shall be responsible for promptly
undertaking any and all measures necessary to correct, repair,
or otherwise remedy the results of the failure, at his sole
expense.
(c) The Town of West Greenwich, and specifically the Planning
Board and its agents, shall not assume any liability or
responsibility for damages resulting from the failure of an SEC
measure, regardless of its role as the authorizing entity for the
SEC components of a land development project.
(5) Final site stabilization and SEC measure removal.
(a) Upon substantial completion of all proposed site construction
work, the Town and/or its agent shall perform a final SEC
inspection in order to verify that the site has been sufficiently
stabilized to allow for the removal of SEC measures.

SEC measures shall not release the developer of his warranty
obligations; the developer shall be solely responsible for
repairing and/or correcting any and all erosion or
sedimentation problems on the site arising during the
remainder of the warranty period.
E. Stormwater mitigation plan (SMP).
(1) The stormwater mitigation plan (SMP) shall focus on the long-term
impacts of a land development project on stormwater runoff after
the construction of a land development project is complete.
Elements of the SMP shall be incorporated into the overall land
development plans; in addition, a separate SMP report shall be
required for land development projects which includes all items
listed in the SWMB checklist.

and the developer, his heirs and assigns (e.g.,
homeowners' associations) establishing maintenance
responsibility for stormwater mitigation features (required
only for stormwater features which will not be maintained
by the Town).
(3) SMP analysis standards. The following analysis standards shall be
met for all SMPs:
(a) Watershed maps. All land development project SMPs shall
include detailed pre- and post-development watershed maps of
the entire project area of a land development project, which
shall depict the following:
[1] Pre-development maps.
[a] Existing topography (minimum two-foot contour
intervals);
[b] Existing physical features, including ground cover,
structures, roads, driveways, natural or man-made
waterways and water bodies, utilities, and other
natural features;
[c] Clearly delineated watershed perimeters for all predevelopment
analysis watersheds;
[d] Assumed time to concentration (Tc) flow paths;
[e] Watershed annotations providing relevant information
on each pre-development analysis watershed,
including (at a minimum) watershed area, impervious

or C coefficient, Tc, peak one-hundred-year runoff flow
rate and runoff volume.
[2] Post-development maps.
[a] Proposed topography (minimum two-foot contour
intervals);
[b] Proposed physical features, including ground cover,
structures, roads, driveways, natural or man-made
waterways and water bodies, utilities, and other
natural features;
[c] Clearly delineated watershed perimeters for all postdevelopment
analysis watersheds;
[d] Assumed time to concentration (Tc) flow paths;
§ 450-52 CHARTER § 450-52

[e] Watershed annotations providing relevant information
on each post-development analysis watershed,
including (at a minimum) watershed area, impervious
area, soil type and hydrologic group (TR-55 only), CN
or C coefficient, Tc, peak one-hundred-year runoff flow
rate and runoff volume.
[3] Pre- and post-development watershed maps may be
included as individual sheets in the overall land
development plans, or may be provided separately within
the SMP. Watershed maps shall be depicted at a scale no
smaller than one inch equals 100 feet.
(b) Pre- and post-development analysis methods. U.S.D.A. NRCS
TR-55 Methodology (preferred) or the Rational Method.
[1] If TR-55 is used, a soils map of the land development area,
including soil types and hydrologic soil groups, shall be
included in the SMP.
[2] If the Rational Method is used, the designer shall
reference and provide the IDF Curve used in the analysis.
(c) Design storms. The SMP shall analyze the two-, ten-, twentyfive-
and one-hundred-year storm events.
(4) SMP design standards.
(a) Structural SMP measures shall consist of a combination of
physical structures designed to collect, convey and mitigate
the increases in peak flow rates and volumes of stormwater
runoff generated by a land development project.
[1] Structural SMP measures shall generally be in accordance
with the standards and specifications of the most current
edition of the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and
Installation Standards Manual (RISDIS) and the Town of
West Greenwich Stormwater Management Plan (WGSMP).
[2] Proposed structural SMP measures may include, but not
be limited to, any combination of the following:
[a] Collection and conveyance systems. Proposed SMP
collection and conveyance components shall be
adequately sized to collect and convey the full
magnitude of post-development stormwater runoff
generated by the one-hundred-year storm event. In
addition, all collection system piping (regardless of
pipe diameter) shall be designed to maintain a
minimum flow velocity of two feet per second.
[i] Catch basins, drop inlets and underground
drainage piping;
§ 450-52 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-52
C:534
[ii] Vegetated or rip-rap swales or open channels.
[b] Stormwater mitigation structures. Proposed SMP
mitigation structures shall be designed to completely
mitigate any increases in the peak flow rates resulting
from the proposed land development, such that the
post-development runoff peak flow rate generated by
the land development is less than or equal to the predevelopment
peak flow rate, for all analyzed storms up
to and including the one-hundred-year event.
[i] Detention, retention and/or infiltration basins.
The Town strongly encourages the use of multiple
smaller ponds, as site conditions permit, to
distribute the drainage more closely to the natural
drainage pattern, rather than one large basin.
[ii] Infiltration trenches.
[iii] Subsurface infiltration chambers.
[3] Developers are strongly encouraged to use structural SMP
measures which promote volumetric mitigation in addition
to peak flow rate mitigation, specifically by means of
stormwater infiltration, where practicable (based on soil
types and depth to groundwater table).
[4] In areas where stormwater mitigation structures are
proposed, and specifically for infiltration structures,
designers shall provide sufficient empirical data (e.g., soil
evaluation logs) in the SMP on subsurface conditions in
the vicinity of the proposed mitigation structures,
demonstrating that there is adequate vertical clearance to
the groundwater table for said structures to work properly
at all times, and demonstrating that the soil types
surrounding the structure are suitable for the use of
infiltration. The Planning Board may, at its sole discretion,
require additional subsurface investigations from the
designer.
[5] Stormwater mitigation features for projects involving
roadway creation shall also be required to provide water
quality treatment. The standard for water quality
treatment shall be the removal of 80% of the total
suspended solids contained in the stormwater runoff, and
the required water quality treatment volume shall be equal
to one inch of runoff over all impervious areas.
(b) Nonstructural SMP measures shall consist of general design
approaches and methodologies which shall help to maintain, as
closely as possible, the pre-development stormwater runoff
§ 450-52 CHARTER § 450-52
C:535
§ 450-53. Site design.
patterns while minimizing the need for structural SMP
measures.
[1] Nonstructural SMP measures shall generally be in
accordance with the standards and specifications of the
most current edition of the Rhode Island Stormwater
Design and Installation Standards Manual (RISDIS) and
the Town of West Greenwich Stormwater Management
Plan (WGSMP).
[2] Proposed nonstructural SMP measures may include, but
not be limited to, any combination of the following:
[a] Reduction of impervious areas to the maximum extent
practicable;
[b] Reduction of land-disturbing activities and the
preservation of existing natural ground cover to the
maximum extent practicable;
[c] Minimization of proposed slopes throughout the land
development, so as to increase the time to
concentration and reduce the peak flow rate;
[d] Use of "natural" or vegetative conveyance structures
such as grassed swales in lieu of "artificial"
conveyance structures such as pipes and catch basins;
[e] Use of infiltration to the maximum extent allowable as
determined by water table depths and soil
characteristics.
[3] The Planning Board, at its sole discretion, may require
developers to fully investigate the feasibility of employing
some or all of these nonstructural measures prior to
granting approval of a land development project. (See
Appendix A for resources.92)
A. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of site design is to create a functional and attractive
development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to ensure that a
project will be an asset to the community. To promote this purpose,
land development projects, development plans, and subdivisions
shall conform to the following standards, which are designed to
result in a well-planned community without adding unnecessarily
to development costs.
92.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 450-52 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-53
C:536
(2) In reviewing any plan, the Planning Board shall take into
consideration the West Greenwich Comprehensive Community
Plan, the public health, safety and general welfare, the comfort and
convenience of the public in general and of the residents of the
immediate neighborhood in particular, and shall set any
appropriate conditions and safeguards in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code and
these regulations, and according to the general criteria and
standards set forth herein.
(3) The Planning Board shall consider whether the parcel being
subdivided or developed has the potential for further subdivision or
development under current applicable zoning regulations. If it has
such potential, the Planning Board shall consider the impacts from
such future development in its review of the proposed subdivision
or development and may impose any or all of the site design
standards provided in this section as necessary to mitigate such
impacts.
(4) If the Planning Board finds a project to be unusually large, or if it is
likely to become a Town landmark, or if it is in a visually prominent
area, or if it is located so as to become part of the Town gateway,
the design must acknowledge the special impact the project would
have on the entire community by addressing the design solution in
an exemplary manner.
B. Site analysis. An analysis of the site and nearby areas shall be required
by the Planning Board for all major subdivisions, minor subdivisions
with road creation, and all land development projects and development
plans. The scope and content of the site analysis shall be discussed
during the pre-application meeting and shall be presented by the
applicant during the master plan stage of review for major projects, and
at the preliminary stage of review for all other projects. Such an
analysis may be required by the Planning Board for minor frontage lot
subdivisions if the Board finds that the proposed development may have
a negative impact on the existing natural and built environment or
would be inappropriate for the character of the surrounding
neighborhood. Such a site analysis shall include written (master or
preliminary) plan narrative and a graphic analysis of the following
characteristics of the development site: site context; geology and soil;
agricultural lands; wetlands; topography; climate; ecology; existing
vegetation, structures, and road networks; visual features; historic
features; rare or endangered plant or animal species; vernal pools; and
past and present use of the site.
C. Subdivision and site development design.
(1) Design of the development shall take into consideration all existing
Town and regional plans for the surrounding community.
§ 450-53 CHARTER § 450-53
C:537
(2) Development of the site shall be based on the characteristics of the
site and upon the site analysis. To the maximum extent practicable,
development shall be located to preserve the natural features of the
site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and to minimize
negative impacts and alteration of natural features, historic and
cultural resources, and areas of scenic value which contribute to
the character of the Town.
(3) The following specific areas shall be preserved as undeveloped
open space or lot area, to the extent consistent with the reasonable
utilization of land, and in accordance with applicable state or Town
regulations:
(a) Unique and/or fragile areas, including freshwater wetlands;
(b) Significant trees or stands of trees, or other vegetative species
that are rare, threatened, or endangered to the area or are of
particular horticultural or landscape value;
(c) Lands in the floodplain, as defined in Article II;
(d) Steep slopes in excess of 15%, unless appropriate engineering
measures concerning slope stability, erosion, and resident
safety are taken;
(e) Habitats of rare, threatened, or endangered wildlife flora and
fauna, as identified on applicable federal or state lists;
(f) Historically significant structures and sites, as listed on federal
or state lists of historic places;
(g) Agricultural lands, as defined herein; and
(h) Scenic vistas and features.
(4) The development should be laid out to: avoid adversely affecting
groundwater and aquifer recharge; to reduce cut and fill; to avoid
unnecessary impervious cover; to prevent flooding; to provide
adequate access to lots and sites; and to mitigate adverse effects of
shadow, traffic, drainage, and utilities on neighboring properties.
Consideration shall be made of existing geological and
topographical features so that the most appropriate use of land is
encouraged.
(5) Development should take advantage of natural solar irradiation
through southern exposure and design features in order to reduce
energy usage and increase connections to the surrounding
environment. Vegetation, berms, and shade structures should be
used to provide warmer areas during winter and cooler areas
during summer. Consider utilizing the space between buildings as
viable "outdoor rooms" which can function as pedestrian transition
areas, provide building connections and overall project
cohesiveness. Building envelopes should be located so that
§ 450-53 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-53
C:538
character-defining site features such as stone walls, open fields,
stands of mature trees, rolling topography (especially slopes in
excess of 15%), ridgelines and outcrops, wetlands, streams, rivers,
ponds and lakes, and listed historic and natural resources are
preserved whenever possible. Avoid placement of structures on
ridgelines or hillcrests. These areas are potentially erosive,
exposed to the wind, and highly visible, making the potential for
negative impacts greater.
(6) Preservation of natural features and amenities. Existing features
which would add value to residential development or to the Town as
a whole, such as woodlands, wetlands, wildflower sites and other
sites of unique botanical interest, areas of historic and cultural
value, sites listed on the Rhode Island Heritage Program, rare and
endangered species, and historic cemeteries, stone walls, and
similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the
subdivision or development. Scenic, historical, archaeological
landmark sites, and features that are located on or adjacent to the
proposed development shall be preserved and protected. In
proposed developments where such sites have been identified,
advisory opinions shall be sought from appropriate state and local
agencies.
(7) The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as
environmentally desirable, by minimizing tree and soil removal. If
development of the site necessitates the removal of established
trees, special attention shall be given to the planting of
replacements or to other landscape treatment. Any grade changes
shall be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring
developed areas.
(8) A proposed development shall be designed so as to provide for
proper surface water management through a system of controlled
drainage that preserves existing natural drainage patterns and
wetlands; enhances groundwater recharge areas; and protects
other properties and existing natural and artificial drainage
features from the adverse effects of flooding, erosion and the
depositing of silt, gravel or stone.
(9) Pedestrian and bicycle circulation shall be separated from motor
vehicle circulation. Safe and convenient pedestrian circulation,
including sidewalks, where appropriate, shall be provided on the
site and its approaches. The pedestrian circulation plan shall be
designed to minimize potential conflicts between vehicles, bicycles
and pedestrians. When adjacent residential and nonresidential
uses can mutually benefit from connection rather than separation,
applicable connective elements such as walkways, common
landscape areas, building orientation, and unfenced property lines
shall be employed.
§ 450-53 CHARTER § 450-53
C:539
(10) Electric, telephone, other wire-served utility lines and service
connections shall be underground insofar as feasible and subject to
state public utilities regulations. Any utility installations remaining
above ground shall be located so as to have a harmonious
relationship to neighboring properties and to the site.
(11) Architectural style shall be in harmony with the prevailing
character and scale of buildings in the neighborhood and the Town
through the use of appropriate building materials, screening,
breaks in roof and wall lines and other architectural techniques.
Variation in detail, form and siting shall be used to provide visual
interest and to avoid monotony. Proposed buildings shall relate
harmoniously to each other with adequate light, air, circulation,
and separation between buildings.
(12) The development shall be served with adequate water supply and
waste disposal systems.
(13) The development shall not place excessive demands on Town
services and infrastructure.
(14) The development shall comply with all zoning requirements.
D. Residential development design.
(1) The Planning Board may vary street locations, lot shapes and
dimensions, yards, and setbacks for the purpose of encouraging
and promoting flexibility, economy, and environmental soundness
in layout and design, provided they conform to the minimum
dimensional requirements of Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town
Code and the lot design standards of the land development and
subdivision regulations.
(2) Residential lots shall front on local streets wherever possible.
(3) Every lot shall have sufficient access to it for emergency vehicles as
well as for those needing access to the property in its intended use.
(4) The placement of dwelling units in residential developments shall
take into consideration topography, privacy, building height,
orientation, drainage, and scenic values.
(5) Lots shall be designed so that proposed buildings have adequate
privacy from adjacent streets.
(6) Vegetated buffer areas may be required by the Planning Board,
where necessary, to avoid adverse impacts from adjacent uses.
(7) The Planning Board may require construction of a private service
road or common driveways to eliminate curb cuts on main arterial
and collector streets, where practicable. Provisions may be made
for construction of a common driveway to provide vehicular access
to multiple frontage lots from a common access point (or points)
§ 450-53 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-53
C:540
onto the public street on which the lots front, or from a local side
road. Minimum standards for the design and construction of such
service roads may be imposed by the Planning Board in order to
provide safe vehicular access.
(8) Easements or other assurances may be required to be granted to
the Town to prohibit individual driveway access from lots onto
frontage streets if adequate provision is made for access from
individual lots to service roads required in Subsection D(7) above.
(9) Provisions shall be made for ensuring adequate site distances from
proposed driveways or common driveways onto adjacent public
streets in order to alleviate any potentially hazardous situations.
(10) Improvements to the street on which the proposed lot(s) fronts may
be required in order to provide safe vehicular access.
(11) Screening/Buffering/Landscaping of the lot and/or driveway from
adjacent public streets may be required;
(12) Preservation of any existing unique natural and/or historic features
such as trees or stone walls may be required.
(13) The Planning Board requires site plans for individual lots in order
to obtain a building permit. House location, driveway location and
slope, lot grading, roof runoff infiltration, site drainage design,
septic location, sedimentation and erosion controls, including
protected limits of disturbance (at a minimum, the SEC
requirements of the approved project), may be required to be
reviewed by the Town, at the applicant's expense.
E. Multifamily, commercial, industrial, and manufacturing development
design.
(1) General.
(a) A multifamily or nonresidential subdivision or development
shall also be subject to all the requirements set forth in
Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code, the requirements of
these regulations, as well as such additional standards
required by the Planning Board, and shall conform to the
proposed land use and standards established in the
Comprehensive Community Plan and other accepted planning
studies and reports.
(b) If a proposed subdivision or development includes land that is
zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the
subdivision and/or site with respect to such land shall make
such provisions as the Planning Board may require.
(2) Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all
subdivisions and developments, the applicant shall demonstrate to
§ 450-53 CHARTER § 450-53
C:541
the satisfaction of the Planning Board that the land itself and
design and layout of the proposed subdivision and/or site are
specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and take into account
other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards
shall be observed:
(a) Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
(b) Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to
accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be
generated thereupon.
(c) Special requirements may be imposed by the Planning Board
with respect to the installation of public utilities, including
water, sewer, and storm drainage.
(d) Stormwater management systems shall be designed for
maintenance to be conducted on-site by the owners at regular
intervals. A schedule for maintenance shall be submitted with
the final plans.
(e) Special requirements may be imposed by the Planning Board
with respect to street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and
construction.
(f) Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed multifamily,
commercial or industrial subdivision or development, including
the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing
or potential residential development and provisions for a
permanently landscaped buffer strip when necessary.
(g) Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent
existing or potential residential areas.
(h) Relationship of proposed structures to environment.
[1] Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to each
other, the terrain, existing buildings, and roads in the
vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed
structures.
[2] Proposed structures shall be so sited as to minimize
adverse impact upon the surrounding area, and
particularly upon any nearby residences, or visual impact
to the streetscape, by reason of:
[a] Building location, height, bulk and shadows;
[b] Building architecture, landscaping, and/or vegetative
screening;
§ 450-53 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-53
C:542
[c] Location, intensity, direction and times of use of
outdoor lighting;
[d] Traffic generation, noise generation and pollution;
[e] Alteration of natural drainage patterns;
[f] Likelihood of nuisances; and
[g] Other similar considerations.
[3] Appropriate natural or artificial screening may be required
to minimize any such adverse impact.
(i) On-site parking and circulation.
[1] The location, width and layout of interior drives shall be
appropriate for the proposed interior circulation. Location
and layout of accessory off-street parking and loading
spaces shall provide for efficient circulation and the safety
of pedestrians and vehicles.
[2] The location of parking areas shall not detract from the
design of proposed buildings and structures or from the
appearance of the existing neighboring buildings,
structures and landscape. Provision shall be made for
access by police, fire and emergency vehicles.
[3] Internal connectivity between abutting sites is encouraged
and may be required by the Planning Board.
[4] A landscaped buffer strip at least 10 feet wide, continuous
except for approved curb cuts, and not including any
sidewalk, shall be established adjacent to any public road,
between the parking lot and the property line. The buffer
strip shall be landscaped with grass, shrubs, and
ornamental or shade trees (minimum 2 1/2 inch caliper
diameter at breast height, that will have, when fully
mature, a trunk of at least 12 inches in diameter, planted
at least every 30 feet along the road frontage), and may
include fences, berms, or other landscape features at the
discretion of the Board. In cases where quality woodland
exists, preserve existing trees between the parking lot and
the right-of-way; provide additional evergreen trees and
shrubs, if needed, to achieve an effective visual buffer.
Required perimeter landscaped buffers shall not be
applied to the required parking lot landscaping area.
[5] Landscaped areas within parking lots shall occupy a
minimum of 10% of the total parking area, with 50% of the
landscaping distributed throughout the parking area itself.
Trees, shrubbery and other landscaping features shall be
of a species and size necessary to provide for shade and for
§ 450-53 CHARTER § 450-53
C:543
screening of unsightly or highly trafficked areas from
public rights-of-way or adjacent uses. The interior of the
parking area shall incorporate landscaped areas in
appropriate locations in order to prevent long,
uninterrupted rows of parking spaces. Additional
perimeter screening and other buffer areas may be
required. A minimum of 10 square feet of landscaping
for each parking space shall be provided within any offstreet
parking area. Each row of parking spaces shall be
terminated by landscaped islands which measure not less
than five feet in width and not less than 18 feet in length.
[6] The following alternatives may be considered:
[a] Provide a continuous landscape strip between every
four rows of parking. This strip shall be a minimum of
eight feet in width.
[b] Create large planting islands (over 600 square feet) to
be located throughout the lot and planted with shade
trees and low shrubs and/or ground cover.
[c] Provide planting islands (a minimum of nine feet wide)
between every 10 spaces to 15 spaces to avoid long
rows of parked cars. Each island should provide at
least one shade tree.
[d] Divide large parking lots into a series of smaller
connected lots using raised landscape strips at least
five feet wide (preferably more), with one shade tree
for every five spaces.
[7] Perimeter parking lot landscaping between similar uses
shall also be provided. A landscape strip a minimum width
of four feet around the perimeter of the paved area of the
lot abutting other lots shall be provided, except for any
curb cuts to abutting properties. This perimeter strip shall
be planted with shade trees and low shrubs, and shall
contain a minimum of one shade tree per every 40 feet of
lot perimeter. Additional shade trees may be necessary to
effectively shade/screen the parking lot. In cases where
quality woodland exists, preserve it to provide the
minimum buffer, and provide additional shrubs, if needed.
[8] Parking areas should be separated from buildings by a
raised walkway or planting strip at least five feet
(preferably more) wide. Where the proposed building is
surrounded on all four sides by public parking serving the
building, all four sides shall require a landscaped planting
area. Parking areas directly abutting the building shall not
be considered acceptable.
§ 450-53 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-53
C:544
[9] Loading areas shall not be in front of buildings. Locate
loading areas at the rear or sides of buildings and screen
as appropriate. Areas adjacent to residential properties
should be free of service circulation.
(j) Landscaping, general requirements. Landscaping shall be
provided as part of the development design, and shall
constitute a minimum of 15% of the entire site. All areas of the
site not occupied by buildings and required improvements
shall be either left in their natural wooded state, or shall be
landscaped by the planting of grass or other vegetative ground
cover, shrubs, and trees as part of the approved landscape
plan. See § 450-49 of this article for requirements of a
landscaping plan. A minimum of 70% of each landscaped area,
at time of planting, shall be planted with grass, ground cover,
shrubs, or other living vegetation, with the balance in mulch or
other approved media.
(k) Operating and performance standards for industrial
construction and operations shall be in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code, Article
VI, §§ 400-80 and 400-81.
(l) Performance bond. The Planning Board may require an
improvement guarantee to be provided by the applicant to
ensure that the project will be completed in accordance with
the approved plans and conditions imposed by the Board. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all site
improvements have been completed or otherwise guaranteed.
There shall be a two-year guarantee on all new plant material,
and the Board may require a maintenance bond to ensure the
implementation and long-term maintenance of landscaping
requirements. If any required tree or shrub dies within the
two-year period, it shall be replaced.
F. Circulation system design.
(1) Any road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient, and
orderly movement of traffic; to meet, but not exceed, the needs of
the present and future population served; to have a simple and
logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and to
present an attractive streetscape.
(2) In a residential subdivision, the road system shall be designed to
serve the needs of the neighborhood in which it is located,
including the connection to vacant and/or developed adjacent
properties.
(3) The development proposal generally shall minimize adverse traffic
effects on the road networks serving the area in question. A traffic
study may be required to document the existing conditions and the
potential impacts of the proposed development.
§ 450-53 CHARTER § 450-53
C:545
(4) Driveway connection to public streets. All entrance and exit
driveways to, or proposed intersections with, public streets shall be
located with due consideration for traffic flow and so as to afford
maximum safety to traffic on the public streets. Roadway design
shall conform to Town and State of Rhode Island Department of
Transportation standards (Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction), as appropriate. All such entrances and exits
and intersections shall be located and designed to:
(a) Conform with municipal sight distance requirements at corner
lots while in accordance with Rhode Island Department of
Transportation standards;
(b) Achieve maximum practicable distance from street
intersections, from existing and proposed access connections
and from adjacent properties;
(c) Minimize left-hand turns and other turning movements;
(d) Discourage the routing of vehicular traffic to and through local
residential streets; and
(e) Driveways on state and local Town roads shall conform with
control dimensions for commercial and residential driveways
in accordance with RIDOT standards. (Refer to the RIDOT
Rules and Regulations Concerning Permission for Use of State
Highway Rights-of-Way.)
G. Landscape design.
(1) Reasonable landscaping shall be provided at site entrances and in
public areas. Refer to Chapter 400, Zoning, of the Town Code for
nonresidential landscaping requirements. The landscaping
regulations in Chapter 400 are the minimum requirements, and the
Planning Board may require additional landscaping.
(2) The plant or other landscaping material that best serves the
intended function shall be selected. Landscaping materials shall be
appropriate for the local environment, soil conditions, and
availability of water. The use of grasses that require minimal
watering and fertilization is encouraged, particularly in areas that
are ecologically sensitive. Native species are preferred, and
invasive species are prohibited. "Water-efficient" and "low-impact
landscaping" shall be incorporated in the design. Disturbance shall
be minimized for individual home sites. Lawn areas that are limited
to areas needed for practical uses are encouraged. A list of
prohibited species is available from the Town Planner's office (list
of species to avoid generated from Rhode Island Wild Plant
Society).
H. Architecture and building context.
§ 450-53 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-53
C:546
(1) General.
(a) Exterior elevation drawings, prepared by a registered
architect, are required for all commercial, industrial, mixeduse,
and multifamily residential buildings. Exterior elevations
shall identify proposed wall materials and depict proposed
colors for the project. Building elevations shall indicate
window locations, door locations, screening of mechanical
equipment and loading dock areas. Building elevations shall be
dimensioned to indicate building length and building height in
addition to notating the building roof pitch. A minimum of four
building elevations, one indicating each side of the building,
shall be provided.
(b) The height and scale of a new building or structure and any
addition to an existing building shall be compatible and
harmonious within its site and with existing surrounding
buildings. Architecture and building materials shall be
compatible with the character and scale of buildings in the
specific neighborhood in which the proposal is sought, through
the use of appropriate buildings, screenings, breaks in the roof
and wall lines and other architectural techniques as
demonstrated by existing rural architecture in the area. The
Town of West Greenwich has few examples to model because of
the rural history of the Town and the existing low-density
development pattern. The immediate surrounding area may
not have any examples to study; however, the larger region
offers examples of other small New England towns. The Town
of West Greenwich has an expectation that new development
will be of high quality in design and will lend a pleasing visual
element to our built environment.
(2) Commercial/Retail/Office/Restaurants.
(a) These types of businesses are the most visible to the
community and tend to have the greatest visual impact to the
public streetscape, and also the greatest public use and
interaction; therefore, their design should be inviting, welldesigned,
and add to the established personality of the
community. Building elevations shall be designed to fit into the
surrounding neighborhood. Building forms shall be designed to
create and define visually attractive exterior and functional
spaces. Architectural gimmicks, such as roof lights, distinctive
roof shapes, large false cornices and parapets that sacrifice the
integrity of a streetscape to promote a single structure, should
be avoided. Buildings which demand visual attention through
the use of bold colors and materials which are not found to be
consistent with maintaining the rural character shall be
avoided. The look of "big box" design with excessive bulk and
lack of detail shall be avoided.
§ 450-53 CHARTER § 450-53
C:547
(b) Facades shall be articulated to reduce massive scale and
uniform, impersonal appearances of large buildings, and
provide visual interest that will be consistent with the
community's identity, character, and scale. Facades greater
than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall
incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth
of at least 3% of the length of the facade and extending at least
20% of the length of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any
facade shall exceed 100 horizontal feet. Ground-floor facades
that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows,
entry areas, awnings, or other such features along no less than
60% of their horizontal length.
(c) Roofs shall be an integral part of the building design and
overall form of the structure and should respond to the general
design and nature of other roofs along the street. Roofs shall
have no less than two of the following features:
[1] Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment such
as HVAC units from public view. The average height of
such parapets shall not exceed 15% of the height of the
supporting wall, and such parapets shall not at any point
exceed 1/3 of the height of the supporting wall. Such
parapets shall feature three-dimensional cornice
treatments;
[2] Overhanging eaves, extending no less than three feet past
the supporting walls;
[3] Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the
supporting walls, with an average slope greater than or
equal to one foot of vertical rise for every three feet of
horizontal run and less than or equal to one foot of vertical
rise for every one foot of horizontal run;
[4] Three or more roof slope planes.
(d) Exterior building materials shall be aesthetically pleasing and
compatible with materials and colors used in traditional New
England architecture. Predominant exterior building materials
shall be high-quality materials, such as brick, wood, sandstone,
other native stone, tinted, textured, concrete masonry units.
Stucco or other materials not typical to traditional New
England architecture shall not be allowed.
(e) Auxiliary structures should be architecturally consistent with
primary structures on site.
(3) Industrial/Manufacturing. This type of development tends to be
recessed off main roads without high visibility. It is recognized that
due to the use and functionality of the buildings needed for
industrial uses, they tend to not be designed for visual interest.
§ 450-53 WEST GREENWICH CODE § 450-53
C:548
However, should an industrial use/building need to locate at a
highly visible area, attention to the visual impact is critical to the
community. Commercial or industrial structures consisting of large
metal or cement block buildings which lack design details shall
be adequately screened from the main road. For buildings with
visibility from the main road, concrete block, steel, or metal shall
not be used as the principal exterior surface and shall not be used
on the front building surface except for architectural treatments.
"Principal exterior surface" shall mean 50% or more of the exterior
wall surface. The Planning Board may require the building design
to comply with the commercial standards above, or may require
additional landscaping around the building, throughout the parking
lot, and along the street from which the building is visible to frame
and/or screen the building and to soften the appearance from the
main road.
(4) Multifamily residential. Multifamily dwellings shall conform to the
predominant character of the surrounding neighborhood. Buildings
shall be designed with traditional roof forms and building scales
that are compatible with the character of the Town and other small
New England towns. Architectural elements such as dormers
should be in proportion with the overall building and should also be
in keeping with the surrounding building context. The Planning
Board shall require traditional New England style architectural
drawings of the exteriors of proposed units to be submitted as part
of development review.
(5) All buildings should be handicapped accessible in accordance with
state and federal laws. Hand railings shall be provided in
accordance with applicable regulations. Stairs should combine
visual attractiveness with safety considerations and provide
landings every 10 stairs for visual variation and pedestrian rest.
Sloping paths are preferable to ramps or lifts.
I. Lighting. Lighting shall be designed so as not to disturb adjacent
properties or traffic. Lights should be directed down, and the height of
light standards shall be appropriate to the site.
J. Site furnishings and amenities. The applicant may wish to include site
furnishings and amenities, such as gazebos, benches, trash containers,
fencing, etc., which should be shown on the plans. Site furnishings shall
be placed so as to leave adequate space for the stockpiling and removal
of snow. Exterior vending machines such as soft drink and cigarette
dispensers are discouraged, unless they are screened such that they do
not constitute another outdoor sign or advertising.
K. On-site storage and use of materials.
(1) Open storage areas, exposed machinery, refuse and waste removal
areas, service yards and exterior work areas, and parking lots shall
be screened from roads and adjacent residential areas through
§ 450-53 CHARTER § 450-53
C:549
§ 450-54. Off-site improvements.
§ 450-55. Areas of special flood hazard.93
The Planning Board shall examine each proposed project to ensure that:
fencing and landscaping and shall be made part of the landscape
view.
(2) Commercial vehicles shall be screened from public view to the
greatest extent possible.
A. Purpose. This section is intended to ensure that the developer provides
off-site infrastructure improvements in order to mitigate the impacts
which are directly or indirectly attributable to new development. Such
improvements may be required by the Planning Board if the Board finds
that there is a reasonable relationship between the requested
improvement and the proposed new development. Off-site
improvements may include, but are not limited to, improvements to the
following:
(1) Sanitary sewers.
(2) Water supply systems.
(3) Roadways.
(4) Sidewalks.
(5) Bicycle paths.
(6) Drainage systems.
(7) Traffic controls and signals.
(8) Fire/Police/Community rescue.
B. Definition and principles. As a condition of final approval, the Planning
Board may require a developer to construct reasonable and necessary
improvements located off of the proposed land being subdivided or
developed. "Necessary improvements" are those clearly and
substantially related to the subdivision or development being proposed.
The Planning Board shall provide in its resolution of final approval the
basis for requiring such off-site improvements. In its resolution, the
Board must find that a significant negative impact on existing
conditions will result if the off-site improvements are not made, and are
clearly documented in the public record. The mitigation required as a
condition of approval must be related to the significance of the
identified impact. All required off-site improvements must be reflected
in the implementation sections of the various elements of the
Comprehensive Community Plan.

D. Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
A. All photogrammetric mapping shall meet ASPRS (American Society of
Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) Class 1 mapping standards for
the specified contour interval (vertical) and shall meet, at a minimum,
ASPRS Class 2 standards for the specified mapping scale (horizontal).
B. For minor subdivisions with a maximum two-lot total buildout and no
road creation. Topographical data can be prepared by a professional
land surveyor utilizing an actual field topographical survey of the site.
C. All topographic data shall be collected in Rhode Island State Plane
Coordinate System, NAD83 datum, in feet, to be compatible with the
RIGIS data formats and standards. All maps produced by
photogrammetric methods shall be stamped and signed by a certified
photogrammetrist (asprs), and shall clearly state what class and
standard it meets. USGS topo quad sheets are not acceptable base map
data. Contours beyond the parcel boundary, or for pre-application plans
only, may be interpolated from USGS published maps. Slopes greater
than 15%, measured over overlapping ten-foot spans, shall be clearly
shaded on the plan.

C:551
§ 450-58. Conservation development.
The physical design requirements and public improvement standards for
conservation design developments shall meet all of the requirements of
§§ 450-46 through 450-57 of this article, and shall also meet the following
additional requirements of this section as follows:
A. Residential development design standards.
(1) Views of house lots from exterior roads and abutting properties
shall be minimized by the use of changes in topography, existing
vegetation, or additional landscaping buffers.
(2) House lots shall be accessed from interior streets rather than from
roads bordering the tract.
(3) Placement of homes along one side of the local road ("singleloaded"
streets) may be required by the Planning Board to enhance
design.
(4) Lot lines shall follow natural boundaries such as stone walls, tree
lines, etc. as practicably possible.
(5) Where possible, incorporate existing special features such as
unique trees, stone walls, glacial erratics, attractive views, etc. into
the design of the home sites.
(6) Consideration shall be made for solar orientation, wind protection,
and other energy-efficient house siting techniques.
B. Utilities.
(1) Water shall be provided by private individual on-site wells.
(2) On-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS/ISDS) shall be
located on individual lots (off-lot or shared systems shall not be
permitted).
(3) Community wells are not permitted.
(4) Community wastewater treatment facilities are not permitted.
(5) Stormwater best management practices. Stormwater facilities and
structures for which Town maintenance will be required shall not

distinct from the lots intended for residential uses (except as
permitted for homestead lots), and from land dedicated as street
rights-of-way.
(4) It shall be free of all structures except cultural artifacts, stone
walls, and structures related to open space uses.
(5) Environmentally sensitive conservation land shall be designed in as
large contiguous conservation areas as practicable to minimize
fragmentation.
