FOREWORD
History
This comprises the codification of the Ordinances of the Borough of Coplay.
The Borough was originally settled in 1799 and was incorporated as a Borough on April
7, 1869, from parts of Upper Saucon Township.
The Code of Ordinances of the Borough was prepared by Penns Valley
Publishers and adopted by the Borough Council on February 13, 1990 by Ordinance
Number 623.
Organization
The code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of the
Borough contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the appendix which lists by abstracted
title all ordinances of a temporary or "one time" nature, (3) the key to the disposition of
each ordinance ever enacted by the Borough, and (4) the index which is an alphabetical
arrangement of subjects.
In the code, each chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific
ordinances can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each
chapter. The index may also be used to search for a subject when one is looking for
general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known in which chapter the
subject might be found. The appendix consists of several general categories containing a
chronological listing of short subject descriptions along with a reference to the original
ordinance and its date of enactment if known.
The key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the codifiers
and the Borough Council with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An ordinance has
either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another ordinance, (3) is located
in a chapter of the code book, or (4) is located in the appendix. Annual tax rate and
budget ordinances are located only in the key. The key is a cross reference to the
original ordinance books of the Borough, and to the location within the code of each
ordinance by number.

amount of such claims or expenses, accompanied by a bill for such amounts.

Municipal claims or Municipal expenses against the property, the insurer shall
pay the claim of the named insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed
upon by the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the following
procedures must be followed:
A. The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Borough, in
the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or fraction thereof.
B. If at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured such insured has

Borough in connection with such re1noval, repair or securing or any

the Borough in excess of that required to pay the Municipal expenses,
provided that the Borough has not con1menced to remove, repair or secure
the building or other structure, in which case the Borough will
complete the work.
(4) Pay to the Borough, for reimbursement to the Borough General Fund,
the amount of the Municipal expense paid by the Borough.
(5) Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the named
insured upon receipt of certificate issued by the Code Enforcement Officer
that the repair, removal or securing of the building or other
structure has been completed in accordance with all applicable codes
and regulations of the Township.
D. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability of the Borough
to recover any deficiency in the amount of Municipal claims or Municipal
expenses recovered pursuant to this Section, or to insurance proceeds, by an
action at law or equity to enforce the codes of the Borough or to enter into
an agreement with the named insured with regard to such other disposition
of the proceeds as the Borough may deem reasonable.
4. Any owner of property, any insured or insurer who violates the provisions of this
Section or who shall fail to comply with any of the requirements hereof shall be liable,
upon summary conviction, to fines and penalties not exceeding $1,000, which
fines and penalties may be collected by suit or summary proceeding brought in the

DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY
§1-1201. Policy.
Coplay Borough has a commitment to provide a safe and healthful workplace for its employees
and to ensure efficient production and services to the taxpayers. We also recognize

our workers.

as defined by applicable law, to fair and evenhanded treatment and to whatever
rights may exist by reason of a contract, including a labor contract, governing
employment.

process to select at least 50% of its CDL drivers, who will be tested for
the use of controlled substances. Additionally, at least 25% of its CDL
drivers will be randomly tested for alcohol use in the first year of the
policy. Drivers selected on a random basis for testing will be required
to supply a urine sample for the drug test. The alcohol test will be
done by a Breathalyzer machine.
(3) Reasonable Cause Testing. Testing will be required by the Borough of
Coplay upon reasonable cause. The conduct necessitating testing, if at
all feasible, shall have been witnessed by at least two supervisors.
However, if only one supervisor is available, only that supervisor need
witness the conduct. Each witness must have received training in the
detection by observing a person's behavior of probably drug and alcohol
use.
(4) Mandatory Post Accident Testing. Drivers will provide urine specimens
for drug testing as soon as possible after a commercial vehicle
accident, but in no case later than 32 hours after the accident. Drivers
must be tested for alcohol as soon as possible after a motor vehicle accident.
A driver may not consume alcohol until he has been tested. An
accident is defined as involving:
(a) A fatality.
(b) The driver receiving a citation under State or local law for a
moving violation arising from the accident.
If, as a consequence of an accident, a driver is seriously injured and cannot
provide a specimen at the time of the accident, he must provide the necessary
authorization for obtaining hospital records and other documents that
will indicate whether there were any controlled substances or alcohol in his
system at the time of the accident.
(5) Return to Duty Testing. If the Borough of Coplay offers a driver reemployment
after the driver has been referred to an alcohol and substance
abuse professional and the driver has undergone all recommended
treatment, the driver will be tested for alcohol and drugs
prior to returning to duty.
(6) Follow-Up Testing. Any driver who has returned to duty after a positive
alcohol or drug test will be subject to unannounced follow-up tests
1-66 12119/2005

results of Borough's alcohol and drug testing program for its drivers
will be maintained for a minimum period of 5 years, except that individual
negative test results will be maintained for a minimum of 12

(2) There shall be a medical review officer who is a licensed doctor of
medicine or osteopathy with knowledge of drug abuse disorders and

subject to the issuance of a Notice of Violation as set forth in the relevant
sections of the Code of the Borough of Coplay.

appeal within 15 days as set forth above and has made payments for appeal set

§15-409. Residential Permit Parking.
1. Findings and Purpose. The Borough finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter vehicle
parkings, therefore depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in which to
park their own vehicles.
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of commuter traffic
which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air level.
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected areas
should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking
preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Therefore, the
Borough considers it to be in the interest of the people of the Borough to provide
for the establishment of a residential permit parking program to insure primary
access to available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to provide
a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of §15-409, words and terms listed in this subsection, as
follows, shall have the following meanings:
2017 S-2 15-33
MOTOR VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC
COMMUTER VEHICLE–a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a person not
a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR–a person who owns or leases real estate within a residential area of
which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business enterprise or
professional office maintained at that address; for the purpose of §15-409, a proprietor
shall be entitled to one parking permit for that business or professional office address.
RESIDENT–a person who owns or leases real property within a residential area and
who maintains either a voting residence, or bona fide occupancy, or both, at that
address.
RESIDENTIAL AREA–a contiguous area containing public highways or parts of public
highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and non-business
property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in Subsection 4 of §15-409 are those deemed
impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on the basis of the following
criteria:
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., Monday
through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles parked (or
standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to 70% or more
of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the area. For the purpose of this
criterion, a legal parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
B. During the same period as specified in Subsection 3A, directly above, 10% or
more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the area are not
registered in the name of a person residing in the area. For the purpose of this
criterion, the latest available information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles
and Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regarding
registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
Provided: in determining that a specific area identified as impacted and eligible for
residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit parking area, the
following factors are taken into consideration:
(1) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and environment.
(2) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Borough.
(3) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking and
related health and safety hazards.
(4) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area.
15-34 12/17/2012
(15, PART 4)
(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit parking
and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection
with it.
(6) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking program
in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or
educational purposes.
4. Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas. The following are designated as
residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)
Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit parking area,
indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under which parking shall be
by permit only.
5. Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking permit shall be made
to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who shall be only the
owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a proprietor of property
immediately adjacent to a street or other location within a residential parking
permit area. A separate application shall be required for each motor vehicle, and
each application shall be accompanied by a $10 permit fee, which shall be for the
use of the Borough, to be applied to the cost of administering the residential permit
parking program. Each application shall contain the following information:
the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be, of the motor vehicle; the
address of the resident or the proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model and
registration number of the motor vehicle; and the driver number as taken from
the a,pplicant's current driver's license. At the discretion of the Chief of Police, the
applicant shall be required, at the time of making application, to present his
driver's license and the vehicle registration card.
6. Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee, and determination
by him that the information upon the application shows that the applicant
is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of Police shall issue to
the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid for the remainder
of the calendar year. The permit shall display the serial and registration numbers
of the motor vehicles, the residential parking area number and the expiration
date. The permit shall be renewable annually before the expiration date, upon
making application for renewal and payment of the $10 permit fee. It shall be
unlawful and a violation of §15-409 for any person to display other than the current
and valid permit while standing or parking in a residential permit parking
area at any time when those permits are to be displayed.
12/20/2010 15-35
MOTOR VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits may be
issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee of $2, to bona fide visitors of
residents of a designated residential permit parking area and exemption parking
permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to handicapped persons.
8. Responsibility of Permit Holder.
A. Notwithstanding any provision of § 15-409 to the contrary, the holder of a
residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a motor vehicle
operated by him in any designated residential parking area during those
times when parking of motor vehicles is permitted in that area. While a vehicle
for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so parked,
that permit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible through the windshield
of the vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve
to the holder a parking space within a designated residential permit
par king area.
B. A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand or park
a motor vehicle in any place where or ~t any time when stopping, standing
or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for other specified
types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder from the observance
of any traffic or parking regulation other than residential permit parking
regulation or restriction.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the permit
shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle operated;
any such use or display by a person other than the permit holder shall constitute
a violation of this §15-409 by the permit holder and by the person
who so used or displayed the parking permit.
D. It shall constitute a violation of § 15-409 for any person falsely to represent
himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to furnish false information
in an application to the Chief of Police in order to obtain a residential
parking permit.
(1) Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority to revoke
the residential parkjng permit of any permit holder found to be
in violation of any provision of § 15-409. Upon written notification to
him of the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit to
the Chief of Police. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute
a violation of § 15-409. Provided: any person receiving such a notice
may, within 10 days after the date of the notice, appeal to Borough
Council for a hearing on the revocation, and the decision of Borough
Council shall be final.

a vehicle on property reserved for a handicapped person or severely disabled
veteran which property has been so posted in accordance with departmental
regulation, which shall require a sign indicating that vehicles in violation of
this Subsection may be towed or fines may be imposed of $100 minimum.
Any vehicle which is unlawfully parked in a designated handicapped parking
area may be removed from that area by towing and may be reclaimed by
the vehicle owner upon payment of towing costs. The fine for parking illegally
in a properly designated handicapped parking space on Borough or
public property without the display of such placard or license shall be $50 if

2. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with the categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471
which are hereby incorporated.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either
the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Director of
Public Works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with Subsections 2.D. and 2.E. below.
B. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in
terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Director of Public Works
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
C. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with
wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Director of Public Works
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e).
D. When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the City of
Allentown convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
Director of Public Works. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only
if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in Subsections 2.D.(l)(a)
through 2.D.(l)(e) below.
(1) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
(a) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use
during the term of its wastewater discharge permit;
(b) Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment
standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for
treatment;
(c) Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the
facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual
average daily flow rate and the long-term average production
rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
2019 S-4 18-14
(18, PART 1)
(d) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
(e) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial
user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(2) An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
(a) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent
mass limits;
(b) Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
(c) Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
Director of Public Works whenever production rates are expected
to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates
determined in Subsection 2.D.(l)(c) of this Section. Upon
notification of a revised production rate, the Director of Public
Works will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility;
and
(d) Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to
Subsection 2.D.(l)(a) of this Section so long as it discharges under
an equivalent mass limit.
(3) When developing equivalent mass limits, the Director of Public Works:
(a) Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual
average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the
industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and
monthly average standard for the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion
factor;
(b) Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
2019 S-4 18-15
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
(c) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the
implementation of water conservation methods and technologies,
and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original
calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the
use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to
Subsection 6. below. The industrial user must also be in
compliance with Subsection 3. of §18.113 regarding the
prohibition of bypass.
E. The Director of Public Works may convert the mass limits of the categorical
Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial
users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.
[Note: When converting such limits to concentration limits, the Director of
Public Works will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40
CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being
substituted for treatment as prohibited by Subsection 6 of this Section (see 40
CFR 403.6(d)). In addition, the Director of Public Works will document how the
equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass
limits, or vice versa, and make this information publicly available (see 40 CFR
403.6(c)(7)).]
F. Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in Subsection 2. of §18-102 in lieu of the
promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)]
G. Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating
maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating
maximum monthly average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. [Note:
See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(8)]
H. Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify
the Director of Public Works within two business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Director of Public
Works of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9)]
2019 S-4 18-16
(18, PART 1)
3. State Pretreatment Standards. (Reserved)
4. Local Limits.
A. The Director of Public Works is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to
40 CFR 403.5(c)
B. Limits for discharging pollutants which are of concern to the POTW will be
made using headworks loading analyses which has been reviewed and approved
by the approval authority. Allocations for discharging such pollutants will be
made to each significant industrial user. Limits may be in the form of monthly
average concentration, daily maximum concentration, or instantaneous
maximum concentration. Limits will be contained in the wastewater discharge
permits issued and will be applied at the point where the wastewater is
discharged to the POTW unless otherwise specified in the permit issued. All
concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated
otherwise. The Director of Public Works may impose mass limitations in
addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
C. The Director of Public Works may develop best management practices (BMPs),
by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and
the requirements of Subsection 1. above.
5. City's Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on
discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this Part.
6. Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to
achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Director of Public Works may
impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 832, 1/15/2019, §2)
§18-103. Pretreatment of Wastewater.
1. Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to
comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Subsection 1. of §18-102 of this
Part within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the Director of Public
Works, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
2019 S-4 18-17
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing
such facilities and operating procedure shall be submitted to the Director of Public
Works for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director of Public Works before such
facilities are constructed. Review and acceptance of plans are not an endorsement of
the effectiveness of any facilities set forth therein and the City shall not be held liable
in any way for the performance of said facilities. The review of such plans and
operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City
under the provisions of this Part.
2. Additional Pretreatment Measures.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Director of Public Works may require users
to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the

than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established scheduled; and
D. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports
to the Director of Public Works.
3. Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline. Within 90
days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment
standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction
of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the Director of Public Works a report containing the
information described in Subsections 5.A.(6) and (7) of §18-104, and Subsection 1.B.(2)
of §18-106 of this Part. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in Subsection 3. of §18-102, this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all
other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation)
this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Subsection 6. of §18-104 of this Part. All sampling will be done in conformance with
Subsection 10 of §18-106.

4. Periodic Compliance Reports.
A. All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the Director
of Public Works submit no less than twice per year (June and December), or on
dates specified, reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the Director of Public Works or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
B. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Subsection 13. of §18-106 of this Part.
C. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not
be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
D. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this Section monitors any
pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required
by the Director of Public Works, using the procedures described in Subsections
9. and 10. of this Section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
5. Reports of Changed Conditions.
A. Each user must notify the Director of Public Works of any planned significant
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
(1) The Director of Public Works may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under Subsection 5. of §18-104 of this Part.
(2) The Director of Public Works may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under Subsection 7. of §18-105 of this Part or modify an existing
wastewater discharge permit under Section 5.4 of this Ordinance in
response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
2019 S-4 18-34
(18, PART 1)
B. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not
limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, loading increases of 20% or more for
pollutants, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
6. Reports of Potential Problems.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges,
discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge,
or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the Director of Public Works of the incident.
This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration, and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the
Director of Public Works, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Part.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge
described in Subsection A. above. Employers shall ensure that all employees,
who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
D. Significant industrial users are required to notify the Director of Public Works
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.
7. Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater
discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Director of Public Works as
the Director of Public Works may require from time to time.
8. Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a user
indicates a violation, the user must notify the Director of Public Works within 24 hours
of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director of Public Works
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial
user is not required if the City performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a
month, or if the City performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial
sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the City receives the results of
this sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user.
2019 S-4 18-35
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
9. Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be
submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and
amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part
136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any
other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the Director of Public Works or other parties approved by EPA.
10. Sample Collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based
on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
A. Except as indicated in Subsections B. and C. below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Director of Public Works. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited
prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics
and fats, oils and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized
by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides,
and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
C. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance
reports required in Subsections 1. and 3. above of this Section [40 CFR 403.12(b)
and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, fats, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data does not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the Director of Public Works may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Subsection 4. above of
this Section (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
2019 S-4 18-36
(18, PART 1)
11. Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on
the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern.
12. Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Part shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Part and any additional records
of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user
independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best
management practices established under Subsection 4.C. of §18-102. Records shall
include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.
These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period
by the Director of Public Works.
13. Certification Statements.
A. Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports. The following certification
statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit
applications in accordance with Subsection 6. of §18-104; users submitting
baseline monitoring reports under Subsection 1.B.(5) above of this Section;
users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment
standard deadlines under Subsection 3. of this Section; users submitting
periodic compliance reports required by Subsection 4. of this Section. The
following certification statement must be signed by an authorized
representative as defined in Subsection 5. of §18-101:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the
best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I
am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment
for knowing violations.
B. Annual Certification for Non-Significant Categorical Industrial Users. A facility
determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user by the Director
2019 S-4 18-37
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
of Public Works pursuant to Subsection 5. of §18-101 and Subsection 6.C. of
§18-104 must annually submit the following certification statement signed in
accordance with the signatory requirements in the definition of “Authorized or
Duly Authorized Representative of the User” in Subsection 5. of §18-101. This
certification must accompany an alternative report required by the Director of
Public Works:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards under 40 CFR, I certify
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from
to [months, days, year]:
(1) The facility described as [facility
name] met the definition of a non-significant categorical industrial user
as described in Subsection 5. of §18-101;
(2) The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements during this reporting period; and
(3) The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical
wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
This compliance certification is based on the following information.
.
14. Hazardous Waste Reporting. Although discharges of hazardous wastes are specifically
prohibited in Subsection 1.B.(18) of §18-102, if any user accidentally discharges a
hazardous waste, the reporting requirements at 40 CFR 403.12(p) (1) shall be adhered
to.
(Ord. 832, 1/15/2019, §6)
§18-107. Compliance Monitoring.
1. Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling. The Director of Public Works shall have the
right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying
with all requirements of this Part and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the Director of Public Works ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
2019 S-4 38
(18, PART 1)
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, the Director of Public Works will be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The Director of Public Works shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the users operations.
C. The Director of Public Works may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility
to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the
written or verbal request of the Director of Public Works and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director of Public Works access to the
users premises shall be a violation of this Part.
2. Search Warrants. If the Director of Public Works has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this Part, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City
designed to verify compliance with this Part or any permit or order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
Director of Public Works may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate
issuing authority.
(Ord. 832, 1/15/2019, §7)
§18-108. Confidential Information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit
applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Director
of Public Works inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without
restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Director of Public Works, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
2019 S-4 18-39
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related
to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving
the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. 832, 1/15/2019, §8)
§18-109. Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance.
The Director of Public Works shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the
users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be
applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
Subsections C., D. or H. of this Section) and shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in
which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits
as defined in §18-102;
B. Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33%
or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as
defined by §18-102 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats,
oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by
§18-102 (Daily Maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Director of Public Works determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the
public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Director of Public Works
exercising his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
2019 S-4 18-40
(18, PART 1)
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule
milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for
starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports,
including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical
pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports
on compliance with compliance schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violations, which may include a violation of best management
practices, which the Director of Public Works determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. 832, 1/15/2019, §9)
§18-110. Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
1. Notification of Violation. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the Director of Public Works may serve upon that user a written notice of violation.
Within 20 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Director of Public Works. Submission of
this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority
of the Director of Public Works to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
2. Consent Order. The Director of Public Works may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Subsections 4. and 5. below of this
Section and shall be judicially enforceable.
3. Show Cause Hearing. The Director of Public Works may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
to appear before the Director of Public Works and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying
2019 S-4 18-41
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A
show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
4. Compliance Orders. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director of Public Works may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for
a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user
of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
5. Cease and Desist Orders. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Director of Public Works may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
6. Administrative Fines.
A. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director of Public Works may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $25,000
regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Such penalties shall be assessed on a
2019 S-4 18-42
(18, PART 1)
per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, penalty shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation. The penalties may be assessed whether or not the violation was
willful or negligent.
B. Notice of assessment of penalty shall state the appeal process to be followed
including the name, address and telephone number of the person responsible
for accepting such appeal. Said notice shall also contain the date or dates of
violation the permit requirement that was violated and the amount of penalty
assessed. The notice shall state the time frame for appeal. It shall be served
personally on the violator or shall be sent by certified mail to the address of the
permit holder as noted on the permit.
C. The penalty shall be assessed in accordance with Chart for Assessment, below,
which sets forth the City of Allentown's assessment policy considering damage
to air, water, land or other natural resources, cost of restoration and abatement,
savings resulting to the person for the violation, history of past violations,
deterrence of future violations and other relevant factors.

D. Other Factors will be Considered. Other factors which may be considered
include, but are not limited to; damage to POTW, willfulness or concealment,
endangerment to the public and/or POTW personnel.
E. Points shall be assessed for a violation in accordance with the above chart which
constitutes the City of Allentown assessment policy. Points shall be totaled and
the fine shall be assessed as follows:
Number of Points Penalty
25 $25,000
20 20,000
15 15,000
10 10,000
5 5,000
F. The assessment of penalties may include numbers which are not whole, such as
1.5, to allow flexibility and discretion by the Director of Public Works in arriving
at a fair and appropriate penalty. The above listed fine shall be then pro-rated
to reflect the less than whole number of points assessed.
Example:
Total points = 12.5
Civil penalty =$12,500.00
G. All fines collected shall be placed in a restricted account and shall only be used
by the City of Allentown to repair damage and provide for additional
maintenance and costs as a result of violations, to pay penalties imposed by
State or Federal Government for violation of pretreatment standards, for the
costs of investigation and enforcement action, for monitoring of discharge in the
pretreatment program and for capital improvement to the POTW.
H. Appeals.
(1) Any party seeking to appeal the assessment of a fine shall do so by filing
a notice of appeal with the Director of Public Works within 30 days after
receipt or service of said notice.
(2) The Appeal Board shall hear all such appeals. A transcript shall be
made of said hearing at the sole expense of the appellant.
2019 S-4 18-44
(18, PART 1)
(3) Appellant shall pay the cost of appeal and the sum for estimate of
stenographer bills at the time of filing said appeal. Failure to pay said
sums at the time of filing shall make the appeal void. Such fees shall be
established as required by the Charter.
(4) After the hearing, any additional stenographer charges shall be billed to
appellant and shall be paid in full within ten days of receipt or appeal
shall be null and void ab initio.
(5) The Appeals Board shall either affirm the decision of the Director of
Public Works or reverse or modify the same as the substantial evidence
indicates in accordance with the assessment policy adopted by the City.
Appeals from the decision of the Appeals Board shall be in accordance
with State law. Each permit holder shall keep the City apprised in
writing of any change in mailing address. The address on the permit
shall be used to send all correspondence and notice of civil assessment
to permit holders. The sending of a notice of civil assessment to a permit
holder's address on permit shall conclusively be presumed to be valid
service; thus, if the certified mail sent to such address is not accepted or
picked up by permit holder, the date of service shall be the date that the
certified mail was rejected or returned unclaimed.
I. The City shall charge all costs for re-establishing the operation of the publicly
owned treatment works after a user has violated, or continues to violate any
provision of this Ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement. These costs
shall be paid by user within ten days after notice of assessment of the same.
Notice and appeal rights shall be the same as in the case of assessment of civil
penalties. Any user not paying said assessment shall pay an additional penalty
of 5% of the penalty per month or any part thereof.
J. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
7. Emergency Suspensions.
A. The Director of Public Works may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The Director of Public Works may also immediately suspend a users discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment
to the environment.
2019 S-4 18-45
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director
of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Director of Public Works may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
Subsection 8. of this Section are initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of
Public Works prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing
under Subsections 3. or 8. of this Section.
B. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any

other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day
during the period of the violation.
B. The Director of Public Works may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the City.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account
all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm
caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,

more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one
year, or both.
4. Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part are not exclusive. The
Director of Public Works may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against
a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the City's enforcement response plan. However, the Director of Public
Works may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the Director of Public Works is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 832, 1/15/2019, §11)
§18-112. Supplemental Enforcement Action.
1. Performance Bonds. The Director of Public Works may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply
with any provision of this Part, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not
to exceed a value determined by the Director of Public Works to be necessary
to achieve consistent compliance.
2. Liability Insurance. The Director of Public Works may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply
with any provision of this Ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
2019 S-4 18-48
(18, PART 1)
3. Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service
to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only
after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
4. Contractor Listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a
contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the City. Existing contracts
for the sale of goods or services to the City held by a user found to be in
significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may
be terminated at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.
(Ord. 832, 1/15/2019, §12)
§18-113. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.
1. Upset.
A. For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which
there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of
Subsection C., below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike
manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the Director of
Public Works within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five days]:
2019 S-4 18-49
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of
an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of
upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
2. Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an
enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions
in Subsection 1.A. of §18-102 of this Part or the specific prohibitions in Subsections
1.B.(3) through 1.B.(17) of §18-102 of this Part if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from
other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance
with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference;
or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature
or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in
compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in
compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements.
3. Bypass.
A. For the purpose of this section:
(1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
potion of a user's treatment facility.
2019 S-4 18-50
(18, PART 1)
(2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a
bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by
delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the
provision of Subsections C. and D. below of this Section.
C. Bypass Notifications.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior
notice to the Director of Public Works, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of Public Works of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards
within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The Director of Public Works may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
D. Bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Public Works may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
2019 S-4 18-51
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
(c) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection 3.C. of
this Section.
(2) The Director of Public Works may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Director of Public Works
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection
D.1. above of this Section.

§18-202. General Sewer Use Requirements.
1. Prohibited Discharge Standards
A. General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the
POTW any pollutant or wastewater that causes pass through or interference.
These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they
are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other National, State,
or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
B. Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the
POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
(1) Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint
of less than 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 261.21 or wastewater causing two readings on an

with other substances, will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW
resulting in interference;
(4) Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released
in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either
singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference
with the POTW;
(5) Wastewater having a temperature that will inhibit biological activity in
the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater
2019 S-4 18-64
(18, PART 2)
which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment
plant to exceed 104 degrees F (40 degrees C);
(6) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil

greater than 200 mg/L.
(18) Any substance which is a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.
C. Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this Section shall not be
processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the
POTW.
2. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with the categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471
which are hereby incorporated.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either
the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Director of
Public Works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with Subsections 2.D. and 2.E. below.
B. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in
terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Director of Public Works
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
C. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with
wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Director of Public Works
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e).
D. When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the City of
Allentown convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
Director of Public Works. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only
if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in Subsections 2.D.(l)(a)
through 2.D.(l)(e) below.
(1) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
(a) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use
during the term of its wastewater discharge permit;
(b) Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment
2019 S-4 18-66
(18, PART 2)
standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for
treatment;
(c) Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the
facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual
average daily flow rate and the long-term average production
rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
(d) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
(e) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial
user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(2) An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
(a) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent
mass limits;
(b) Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
(c) Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
Director of Public Works whenever production rates are expected
to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates
determined in Subsection 2.D.(l)(c) of this Section. Upon
notification of a revised production rate, the Director of Public
Works will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility;
and
(d) Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to
Subsection 2.D.(l)(a) of this Section so long as it discharges under
an equivalent mass limit.
(3) When developing equivalent mass limits, the Director of Public Works:
(a) Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual
average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the
2019 S-4 18-67
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and
monthly average standard for the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion
factor;
(b) Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(c) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the
implementation of water conservation methods and technologies,
and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original
calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the
use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to
Subsection 6. below. The industrial user must also be in
compliance with Subsection 3. of §18.213 regarding the
prohibition of bypass.
E. The Director of Public Works may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial
users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.
[Note: When converting such limits to concentration limits, the Director of
Public Works will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40
CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being
substituted for treatment as prohibited by Subsection 6 of this Section (see 40
CFR 403.6(d)). In addition, the Director of Public Works will document how the
equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass
limits, or vice versa, and make this information publicly available (see 40 CFR
403.6(c)(7)).]
F. Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in Subsection 2. of §18-202 in lieu of the
promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)]
G. Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating
maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating
maximum monthly average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. [Note:
See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(8)]
2019 S-4 18-68
(18, PART 2)
H. Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify
the Director of Public Works within two business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Director of Public
Works of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9)]
3. State Pretreatment Standards. (Reserved)
4. Local Limits.
A. The Director of Public Works is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to
40 CFR 403.5(c)
B. Limits for discharging pollutants which are of concern to the POTW will be
made using headworks loading analyses which has been reviewed and approved
by the approval authority. Allocations for discharging such pollutants will be
made to each significant industrial user. Limits may be in the form of monthly
average concentration, daily maximum concentration, or instantaneous
maximum concentration. Limits will be contained in the wastewater discharge
permits issued and will be applied at the point where the wastewater is
discharged to the POTW unless otherwise specified in the permit issued. All
concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated
otherwise. The Director of Public Works may impose mass limitations in
addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
C. The Director of Public Works may develop best management practices (BMPs),
by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and
the requirements of Subsection 1. above.
5. City's Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on
discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this Part.
6. Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to
achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Director of Public Works may
impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 835, 1/15/2019, §2)
2019 S-4 18-69
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
§18-203. Pretreatment of Wastewater.
1. Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to
comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Subsection 1. of §18-202 of this
Part within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the Director of Public
Works, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing
such facilities and operating procedure shall be submitted to the Director of Public
Works for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director of Public Works before such
facilities are constructed. Review and acceptance of plans are not an endorsement of
the effectiveness of any facilities set forth therein and the City shall not be held liable
in any way for the performance of said facilities. The review of such plans and
operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City
under the provisions of this Part.
2. Additional Pretreatment Measures.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Director of Public Works may require users
to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this Part.
B. The Director of Public Works may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
Director of Public Works, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Director of Public Works and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the user at their expense.
D. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required by
the Director of Public Works to install and maintain an approved combustible
gas detection meter.
2019 S-4 18-70
(18, PART 2)
3. Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. The Director of Public Works shall evaluate
whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control
plan or other action to control slug discharge. The Director of Public Works may require
any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan, or take such
other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the
Director of Public Works may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
A. Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
B. Description of stored chemicals;
C. Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of Public Works of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by Subsection 6. of §18-206 of this
Part; and
D. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge.
Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of
storage, areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading
operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment
structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants,
including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
4. Hauled Wastewater.
A. Any hauler, operator, person or persons cleaning cesspools, septic tanks, privies
or any other container governed by this Section shall obtain a license from the
City before cleaning such containers and hauling the material to the designated
place of disposal within the City. Such license cannot be transferred from one
operator, owner, person or persons, to another without prior approval by the
City.
B. The sewage and wastes discharged into the POTW shall not contain industrial
waste, chemicals or other matter, with or without pretreatment that does not
conform to the requirements of Subsection 1. of §18-202 or any other
requirements established by the City. The Director of Public Works may require
the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. The
Director of Public Works may require a hauler to obtain an industrial waste
discharge permit.
C. Any waste to be discharged from tank trucks shall be disposed at the POTW or
other location designated by the Director of Public Works and at the time or
times fixed by the Director of Public Works.
D. Haulers must provide a waste-tracking form, or forms, for every load. For each
privy, cesspool, septic tank or container cleaned by a hauler, operator or any

F. The license fee for renewal of a current septage hauler's permit as required
herein is to be established in accordance with the requirements of the Charter.
No permits are to be issued to any new applicants. All permits to be issued will
be to an individual, corporation or firm on file for the year preceding the permit
renewal date. A new applicant may obtain a license by purchase of the business
of a licensed hauler whose license is current and valid. The new license will be
limited to that annual volume of waste previously disposed of at the plant under
the license purchased. This assumption of the business by a new owner limits
the area of collection to those townships, boroughs, villages, towns and other
governmental boundaries which are serviced by the integrated sewer system
served by the City of Allentown. The term of the license shall be from June 1 to
May 31 of the succeeding year.
G. The fee for disposal into the City sewage treatment plant, at the location
designated, shall be established in accordance with the requirements of the
Charter and shall be based on a rate per 1,000 gallons, or a portion thereof.
H. An application form shall be filled out by the hauler, operator, owner, person or
persons, prior to the conducting of such a business within the City as governed
in this Section. The application form shall contain the following information:
(1) Name and address of owner, operator, hauler, person or persons;
(2) Date of the license issued;
(3) The fee for the license as required herein to be established in accordance
with the requirements of the Charter;
(4) Term of the license: From June 1 to May 31 of the succeeding year;
(5) The size and make of truck, containers, etc., stated in gallons;
(6) Place of storage, garage or parking of trucks, containers, etc., when not
in use;
(7) License cannot be transferred from one operator, owner, person or
persons, to another without approval by the City.
(8) A statement to the effect that such trucks, containers, equipment, etc.,
will be available for inspection by the person designated to make
inspection from the City at such time and place agreeable to both hauler
and inspector.
(9) Refusal of agreement to these conditions of inspection at a reasonable
time can be cause for forfeiture of the license.

SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
(10) A higher fee per load, container or portion thereof can be charged, if the
need for processing, extra analyses, etc., shall be necessary.
(11) If a tank or container contains more than 1,000 gallons, an additional fee
shall be charged for each 1,000 gallons additional, or portion thereof. The
additional fee, as required herein, is to be established in accordance with
the requirements of the Charter.
(12) It shall be understood by all applicants for a permit or those having a
license that the septage haulers' permits are an extended courtesy by the
City and upon 60 days notification by the City can be terminated if there
is reasonable cause for such action or there is a necessity to reduce the
volume of materials to allow the City to comply with its effluent
limitations for discharge to the Lehigh River or for any other functional
activity at the wastewater treatment plant operations, which would
require a reduction in the septage volume being processed.
I. Failure to secure a license, permit or pay dumping fees, when required, as
governed in this Section or operating after suspension or revocation of a license
or permit by the City shall constitute a violation of this Section. When a written
notice of a violation of any of the provisions of this Section has been served upon
any hauler, owner, operator, person or persons in this business, such violation
shall be discontinued immediately. In such cases when the violation is of
immediate danger to the health of the public, and is in danger of damage to the
sewage treatment plant system, such operation must cease at once, until the
condition is remedied and abated.
(Ord. 835, 1/15/2019, §3)
§18-204. Wastewater Discharge Permits.
1. Wastewater Analysis. When requested by the Director of Public Works, a user must
submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 90 days
of the request. The Director of Public Works is authorized to prepare a form for this
purpose and may periodically require users to update this information.
2. Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement.
A. No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW
without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the Director of
Public Works, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely
application pursuant to Subsection 3. of this Section may continue to discharge
for the time period specified therein.
2019 S-4 18-74
(18, PART 2)
B. The Director of Public Works may require other users to obtain wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Part.
C. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit
shall be deemed a violation of this Part and subjects the wastewater discharge
permittee to the sanctions set out in §§18-210 and 18-212 of this Part.
Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its
obligation to comply with all Federal and State pretreatment standards or
requirements or with any other requirements of Federal, State, and local law.
3. Wastewater Discharge Permitting: Existing Connection. Any user required to obtain
a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior
to the effective date of this Part and who wishes to continue such discharges in the
future, shall, within 90 days after said date, apply to the Director of Public Works for

under Subsection 7. of §18-205 of this Part or modify an existing
wastewater discharge permit under Subsection 4. of §18-205 of this
Ordinance in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
B. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not
limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, loading increases of 20% or more for
pollutants, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
6. Reports of Potential Problems.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges,
discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge,
or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the Director of Public Works of the incident.
This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration, and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the
Director of Public Works, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
2019 S-4 18-87
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Part.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge
described in Subsection A. above. Employers shall ensure that all employees,
who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
D. Significant industrial users are required to notify the Director of Public Works
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.

discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Director of Public Works as
the Director of Public Works may require from time to time.
8. Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a user
indicates a violation, the user must notify the Director of Public Works within 24 hours
of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director of Public Works
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial
user is not required if the City performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a
month, or if the City performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial
sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the City receives the results of
this sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user.
9. Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be
submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and
amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part
136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any
other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the Director of Public Works or other parties approved by EPA.
10. Sample Collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based
on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
2019 S-4 18-88
(18, PART 2)
A. Except as indicated in Subsections B. and C. below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Director of Public Works. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited
prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics
and fats, oils and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized
by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides,
and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
C. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance
reports required in Subsections 1. and 3. above of this Section [40 CFR 403.12(b)
and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, fats, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data does not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the Director of Public Works may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Subsection 4. above of
this Section (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
11. Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on
the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern.
12. Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Part shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Part and any additional records
of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user
independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best
management practices established under Subsection 4.C. of §18-202. Records shall

2019 S-4 18-90
(18, PART 2)
(2) The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements during this reporting period; and
(3) The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical
wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
This compliance certification is based on the following information.
.
14. Hazardous Waste Reporting. Although discharges of hazardous wastes are specifically
prohibited in Subsection 1.B.(18) of §18-202, if any user accidentally discharges a
hazardous waste, the reporting requirements at 40 CFR 403.12(p) (1) shall be adhered
to.
(Ord. 835, 1/15/2019, §6)
§18-207. Compliance Monitoring.
1. Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling. The Director of Public Works shall have the
right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying
with all requirements of this Part and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the Director of Public Works ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, the Director of Public Works will be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The Director of Public Works shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the users operations.
C. The Director of Public Works may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment

user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
2019 S-4 18-91
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility
to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the
written or verbal request of the Director of Public Works and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director of Public Works access to the
users premises shall be a violation of this Part.
2. Search Warrants. If the Director of Public Works has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this Part, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City
designed to verify compliance with this Part or any permit or order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
Director of Public Works may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate
issuing authority.
(Ord. 835, 1/15/2019, §7)
§18-208. Confidential Information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit
applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Director
of Public Works inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without
restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Director of Public Works, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related
to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving
the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. 835, 1/15/2019, §8)
§18-209. Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance.
The Director of Public Works shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the
2019 S-4 18-92
(18, PART 2)
users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be
applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
Subsections C., D. or H. of this Section) and shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in
which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits
as defined in §18-202;
B. Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33%
or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as
defined by §18-202 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats,
oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by
§18-102 (Daily Maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Director of Public Works determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the
public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Director of Public Works
exercising his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule
milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for
starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports,
including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical
pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports
on compliance with compliance schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violations, which may include a violation of best management
practices, which the Director of Public Works determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

§18-210. Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
1. Notification of Violation. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the Director of Public Works may serve upon that user a written notice of violation.
Within 20 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Director of Public Works. Submission of
this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority
of the Director of Public Works to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
2. Consent Order. The Director of Public Works may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Subsections 4. and 5. below of this
Section and shall be judicially enforceable.
3. Show Cause Hearing. The Director of Public Works may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
to appear before the Director of Public Works and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying
the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A
show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
4. Compliance Orders. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director of Public Works may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for
2019 S-4 18-94
(18, PART 2)
a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user
of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
5. Cease and Desist Orders. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Director of Public Works may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
6. Administrative Fines.
A. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director of Public Works may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $25,000
regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Such penalties shall be assessed on a
per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, penalty shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation. The penalties may be assessed whether or not the violation was
willful or negligent.
B. Notice of assessment of penalty shall state the appeal process to be followed
including the name, address and telephone number of the person responsible
for accepting such appeal. Said notice shall also contain the date or dates of
violation the permit requirement that was violated and the amount of penalty
assessed. The notice shall state the time frame for appeal. It shall be served
personally on the violator or shall be sent by certified mail to the address of the
permit holder as noted on the permit.
C. The penalty shall be assessed in accordance with Chart for Assessment, below,
which sets forth the City of Allentown's assessment policy considering damage
to air, water, land or other natural resources, cost of restoration and abatement,
savings resulting to the person for the violation, history of past violations,
deterrence of future violations and other relevant factors.

D. Other Factors will be Considered. Other factors which may be considered
include, but are not limited to; damage to POTW, willfulness or concealment,
endangerment to the public and/or POTW personnel.
E. Points shall be assessed for a violation in accordance with the above chart which
constitutes the City of Allentown assessment policy. Points shall be totaled and
the fine shall be assessed as follows:
Number of Points Penalty
25 $25,000
20 $20,000
15 $15,000
10 $10,000
5 $5,000
2019 S-4 18-96
(18, PART 2)
F. The assessment of penalties may include numbers which are not whole, such as
1.5, to allow flexibility and discretion by the Director of Public Works in arriving
at a fair and appropriate penalty. The above listed fine shall be then pro-rated
to reflect the less than whole number of points assessed.
Example:
Total points = 12.5
Civil penalty =$12,500.00
G. All fines collected shall be placed in a restricted account and shall only be used
by the City of Allentown to repair damage and provide for additional
maintenance and costs as a result of violations, to pay penalties imposed by
State or Federal Government for violation of pretreatment standards, for the
costs of investigation and enforcement action, for monitoring of discharge in the
pretreatment program and for capital improvement to the POTW.
H. Appeals.
(1) Any party seeking to appeal the assessment of a fine shall do so by filing
a notice of appeal with the Director of Public Works within 30 days after
receipt or service of said notice.
(2) The Appeal Board shall hear all such appeals. A transcript shall be
made of said hearing at the sole expense of the appellant.
(3) Appellant shall pay the cost of appeal and the sum for estimate of
stenographer bills at the time of filing said appeal. Failure to pay said
sums at the time of filing shall make the appeal void. Such fees shall be
established as required by the Charter.
(4) After the hearing, any additional stenographer charges shall be billed to
appellant and shall be paid in full within ten days of receipt or appeal
shall be null and void ab initio.
(5) The Appeals Board shall either affirm the decision of the Director of
Public Works or reverse or modify the same as the substantial evidence
indicates in accordance with the assessment policy adopted by the City.
Appeals from the decision of the Appeals Board shall be in accordance
with State law. Each permit holder shall keep the City apprised in
writing of any change in mailing address. The address on the permit
shall be used to send all correspondence and notice of civil assessment
to permit holders. The sending of a notice of civil assessment to a permit
holder's address on permit shall conclusively be presumed to be valid
service; thus, if the certified mail sent to such address is not accepted or
2019 S-4 18-97
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
picked up by permit holder, the date of service shall be the date that the
certified mail was rejected or returned unclaimed.
I. The City shall charge all costs for re-establishing the operation of the publicly
owned treatment works after a user has violated, or continues to violate any
provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement. These costs
shall be paid by user within ten days after notice of assessment of the same.
Notice and appeal rights shall be the same as in the case of assessment of civil
penalties. Any user not paying said assessment shall pay an additional penalty
of 5% of the penalty per month or any part thereof.
J. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
7. Emergency Suspensions.
A. The Director of Public Works may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The Director of Public Works may also immediately suspend a users discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment
to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director
of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Director of Public Works may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
Subsection 8. of this Section are initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of
Public Works prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing
under Subsections 3. or 8. of this Section.
2019 S-4 18-98
(18, PART 2)
B. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any
emergency suspension under this Section.
8. Termination of Discharge.
A. In addition to the provisions in Subsection 6. of §18-205 of this Part, any user
who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in §18-202 of this Part.
B. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under Subsection 3. above of this Section
why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the
Director of Public Works shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
(Ord. 835, 1/15/2019, §10)
§18-211. Judicial Enforcement Remedies.
1. Injunctive Relief. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of
Public Works may petition the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas for the issuance
of a restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit,
order, or other requirement imposed by this Part on activities of the user. The Director
of Public Works may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against a user.
2019 S-4 18-99
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
2. Civil Penalties.
A. A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum
civil penalty of $25,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or
other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day
during the period of the violation.
B. The Director of Public Works may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the City.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account
all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm
caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against a user.
3. Criminal Prosecution.
A. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Part, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
summary offense, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation,
per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.
B. A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW
which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000, or be
subject to imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. This penalty shall
be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property
damage available under State law.
C. A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this Part, wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly
renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Part
shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 per
violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.
2019 S-4 18-100
(18, PART 2)
D. In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not
more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one
year, or both.
4. Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part are not exclusive. The
Director of Public Works may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against
a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the City's enforcement response plan. However, the Director of Public
Works may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the Director of Public Works is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 835, 1/15/2019, §11)
§18-212. Supplemental Enforcement Action.
1. Performance Bonds. The Director of Public Works may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply
with any provision of this Part, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not
to exceed a value determined by the Director of Public Works to be necessary
to achieve consistent compliance.
2. Liability Insurance. The Director of Public Works may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply
with any provision of this Part, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
3. Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service
to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only
after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
4. Contractor Listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a
contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the City. Existing contracts
for the sale of goods or services to the City held by a user found to be in
significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may
be terminated at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.

§18-213. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.
1. Upset.
A. For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which
there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of
Subsection C., below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike
manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the Director of
Public Works within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five days]:
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of
an upset shall have the burden of proof.
2019 S-4 18-102
(18, PART 2)
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of
upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
2. Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an
enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions
in Subsection 1.A. of §18-202 of this Part or the specific prohibitions in Subsections
1.B.(3) through 1.B.(17) of §18-202 of this Part if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from
other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance
with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference;
or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature
or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in
compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in
compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements.
3. Bypass.
A. For the purpose of this section:
(1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
potion of a user's treatment facility.
(2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a
bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by
delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the
provision of Subsections C. and D. below of this Section.
2019 S-4 18-103
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
C. Bypass Notifications.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior
notice to the Director of Public Works, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of Public Works of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards
within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The Director of Public Works may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
D. Bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Public Works may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection 3.C. of
this Section.
(2) The Director of Public Works may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Director of Public Works
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection
D.1. above of this Section.

extension. To obtain an extension, you must call (610-262-6088) or write (98
S. Fourth Street, Coplay, PA 18037) to the Borough Secretary as soon as
possible. The Borough must receive your request for an extension no later
than fifteen (15} days before the deadline for your response or, if later,
five (5) days after you receive the Borough's reques~ for information. The
Borough may grant a reasonable extension if there is good reason for it. If
you are not satisfied with the Borough's decision, you may appeal to the
Borough Council. The Borough will not take any action against you for the
tax years in question until after the response period expires, including
extensions.
The Borough will not request information for any tax required to be paid
or any tax return required to be filed, more than three (3} years before the
mailing date of the notice unless either: (i} the Borough has reason to
believe that you failed to file a return or pay a tax due more than three (3}
years before the date of the notice; or (ii) after an initial request for
information, the Borough determines that you failed to file a return, under
reported income or failed to pay a tax one (1) or more periods covered by the
initial request. The Borough will not request copies of your Federal
individual income tax return, unless the information is not available from
other available sources (including the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue}
and is reasonably necessary to collect or enforce the tax.
All responses for requests for information shall be accompanied by a
statement that the information presented is true, correct and complete to
best of your knowledge, information and belief, subject to the penalties of
18 Pa.C.S. §4904 (relating to unsworn falsification to authorities).
If you do not respond to a request for information by the deadline
(including extensions}, or do not provide all information requested, the
Borough may estimate and assess the taxes due based on any information
available to it.
Notice of Underpayment; Penalties and Interest.
If the Borough determines that you have underpaid any eligible tax
and/or are liable for interest and/or penalties relating to an eligible tax,
Page Added 2/8/2000 - 354.5 -
TAXATION, SPECIAL
the Borough will send you a written notice that states:
A. The tax period(s} for which there is an underpayment and the
amount of underpayment for each tax period.
B. An itemization of the revisions made by the Borough to the
return(s) or report(s) filed by you, which result in the determination
that there is an underpayment.
C. Any applicable interest or penalties and the manner which they
are calculated.
D. The legal basis for the determination.
This notice is also known as an "assessment. 11 If you believe and
assessment is wrong and wish to challenge it, you must file a timely petition
for reassessment under the procedures described in the administrative appeals
section, below. Otherwise, you will lose the right to dispute the assessment
and the Borough will proceed to collect the tax, interest and/or penalties
assessed.
Erroneous Advice by the Borough.
If any Borough official or agent acting in his/her official capacity
gives you any written advice in response to a specific written request from
you, and you reasonably rely on that advice, but it turns out that the advice
was wrong and that you owe additional tax, the Borough will not collect any
penalty or interest from you on that additional tax, unless it results from
your failure to provide adequate or accurate information. The Borough is not
required to provide any written advice to taxpayers.
Requests for Refunds.
If you believe that you overpaid any eligible tax, you may file a
written request for a refund or credit, addressed to 98 s. Fourth Street,
Coplay, PA 18037 (if you show an overpayment on a tax return, we will
consider that a request for a cash refund, unless you state otherwise on the
return}. The request must be filed no later than the following deadlines:
A. If a return or report is required for the particular tax, the
deadline is the later of (i} three (3) years after the due date of the
return or report (including extensions); or (ii} one (1) year after
actual payment of the tax.
B. If no return or report is required, the deadline is the later
of (i} three (3} years after the due date for payment of the tax; or
(ii} one (1) year after actual payment of the tax.
C. If you paid the tax because you received notice from the
Borough telling you that you owe the tax, the deadline is one (1) year
after the date of payment.
A 11 request 11 for a refund is handled by the Tax Collector, who will
ordinarily respond within thirty (30} days. However, you are not required to
file a 11 request 11 and may file a "petition" for a refund directly to the
- 354.6 - Page Added 2/8/2000
(24, PART 7}
Borough Council under the procedures described in the administrative appeals
section, below. Even if you file a 11 request 11 with the Tax Collector, and you
have not received a response, you must file any "petition" to the Borough
Council within the time limits for petitions.
If you receive and cash a refund check from the Borough for an eligible
tax, you may still file a timely request or petition for an additional refund
if you believe you are entitled to it.
Interest on Overpayments.
If you overpay any eligible tax and the Borough does not refund the
overpayment or apply it to any other tax, interest or penalty owed to the
Borough within seventy-five (75} days after the due date of the tax return or
report {or, if later, within seventy-five (75} days after you file the return
or report), you are entitled to simple interest on the overpayment from the
"date of overpayment" to the "date of resolution," as defined in the Act.
You are not entitled to any interest on overpayments of interest or
penalties.
Taxpayer Complaints.
If you have any complaints about the manner in which any officer,
employee or agent is administering the Borough tax laws, you may present them
to the President of Borough Council or the entire Borough Council.
Administrative Appeals.
If you wish to challenge or dispute any assessment or determination of
tax, interest or penalties by the Borough, you must file a written petition
for reassessment with the Borough Council within ninety {90) days after the
date the assessment notice was mailed to you.
If you believe you have overpaid any eligible tax and are entitled to
a refund, you may file a written petition for refund with the Borough
Council. The petition must be filed no later that the following deadlines,
even if you have filed a "request" for refund with the Tax Collector and have
not yet received a response:
A. If a return is required for the particular tax, the deadline
is the later of (i) three (3) years after the date of the return or
report (including extensions}; or (ii) one (1) year after actual payment
of the tax.
B. If no return or report is required, the deadline is the later
of (i) three (3) years after the due date for payment of the tax; or
(ii) one (1) year after actual payment of the tax.
If you wish to appeal a decision of the Borough denying or limiting your
request for an extension of time to respond to a Borough request for tax
information, you may file a written petition for reconsideration with the
Borough Council within five (5) days after the date of the decision.
The petition need not be in any particular form, but must include a
concise statement of all the reasons supporting the application. A petition
Page Added 2/8/2000 - 354.7 -
TAXATION, SPECIAL
for reassessment or reconsideration shall also include a copy of the
assessment or decision being appealed. A petition is considered "filed" on
the date it is hand delivered to the office of the Borough Secretary, 98 S.
Fourth Street, Coplay, PA 18037, or the date that the letter/envelope
transmitting it (and bearing sufficient postage) is postmarked by the United
States Postal Service for delivery to that address.
A petition shall be considered by the Borough Council i:n executive
session. Borough Council shall not conduct a formal hearing and no
stenographic or other record shall be made of the executive session. The
process shall be a "review and decision" under 53 Pa.C.S. §8430(2) and not a
"hearing and decision. " However, you may personally or, through counsel,
present relevant, nonrepetitious evidence to the Borough Council, without
regard to formal rules of evidence, and shall be given the opportunity to
present argument in support of your position. Borough officials or agents
may also present evidence and argument in support of their assessment or
decision or in opposition to the relief requested. Cross-examination shall
only be permitted in the discretion of Council.
Borough Council shall render a decision on a petition and mail a written
decision to you within sixty (60) days after the date a complete and accurate
petition is received by the Borough. The decision need not contain any
findings of fact or conclusions of law. If Council f_ails to act within that
time, the petition shall be deemed approved.
Appeals to Court.
If you were not satiated with the decision of Borough Council on any
petition, you may appeal that decision to the Lehigh County Court of Common
Pleas within thirty (30) days after the date the decision was mailed to you.

so you should consult an attorney. You will be entitled to a hearing on the
matter before the court. However, you may only appeal those matters which
you presented in your petition and you may not appeal to court if you did not
file a timely and complete petition to the Borough Council.
Enforcement Procedure.
If you fail to pay eligible taxes against you, plus interest and
penalties, the Borough may bring civil action against you before the local
district justice or the Lehigh County Court of Common Peas. If the Borough
obtains a judgment against you in this action, the Borough may cause the
Sheriff to sell your real or personal property to pay the judgment. The
judgment may also become a lien on your real property. The Borough may also
collect the taxes from your employer by garnishing a portion of your wages.
You should also be aware that it is a crime to fail, neglect or refuse
to file required returns or reports, to file false information or fraudulent
returns and to refuse to permit the Tax Collector to examine your books,
records and papers. The Borough may prosecute you for these crimes before
the district justice.

Little Lehigh Creek Watershed Act 167- Stormwater Management Ordinance
[NOTE: *Throughout the Part, where an asterisk appears, the ordinance provided that
"these provisions are from the DEP Guidance on MS4 Ordinance Provisions and are not
required for municipalities not subject to the NPDES Phase II regulations."]
A. General Provisions.
§201. Short Title.
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Little Lehigh Creek Watershed Act
167 Stormwater Management Ordinance."
(Ord. 7 41, 3/8/2005, Art. 1, § 101)
§202. Statement of Findings.
The governing body of the Municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from
development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, changes the natural hydrologic
patterns, destroys aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations
and loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers,
greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health
and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion and
loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety and
welfare and the protection of the people of the Municipality and all of the
people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge
for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality.*
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential
component in successfully addressing stormwater.*
12/19/2005 26-9
WATER
E. Federal and state regulations require certain Municipalities to implement a
program of stormwater controls. These Municipalities are required to obtain
a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES).*
F. Nonstormwater discharges to Municipal separate storm sewer systems can
contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth by the Municipality.*
(Ord. 741, 3/8/2005, Art. 1, §102)
§203. Purpose.
The purpose of this Part is to promote the public health, safety and welfare within the
Little Lehigh Creek Watershed by minimizing the damages and maximizing the benefits
described in §202 of this Part by provisions designed to:
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating activities
which cause such problems.
B. Utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage systems.
C. Encourage infiltration of stormwater, where appropriate, to maintain
groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater
quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
D. Maintain the existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the
Municipality and the Commonwealth.
E. Preserve and restore the, flood carrying capacity of streams.
F. Provide for proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management
BMPs that are implemented in the Municipality.
G. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning,
design and management.*
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a
minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.*
I. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations
at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain existing uses
and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams
and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams.*
J. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.*
26-10 12119/2005
(26, Part 2)
K. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.*
(Ord. 7 41, 3/8/2005, Art. 1, § 103)
§204. Statutory Authority.
The Municipality is empowered to regulate these activities by the authority of the Act of
October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as amended, the
Stormwater Management Act and the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed Act 167 --Stormwater
Management Ordinance.
(Ord. 741, 3/8/2005, Art. 1, §104)
§205. Applicability.
1. This Part shall only apply to those areas of the Municipality which are located
within the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed as delineated on an official map available
for inspection at the Municipal office. A map of the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed
at a reduced scale is included in Appendix A for general reference. 1
2. The following activities are defined as regulated activities and shall be governed
by this Part:
A. Land development.
B. Subdivision.
C. Construction of new or additional impervious surfaces (driveways, parking
lots, etc.).
D. Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
E. Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
F. Installation of stormwater systems or appurtenances thereto.
G. Regulated earth disturbance activities.*

WATER
§206. Exemptions.
1. Impervious Cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those defined in
§205(E) and (F), which would create 10,000 square feet or less of additional impervious
cover is exempt from the drainage plan preparation provisions of this
Part. The date of the Municipal Ordinance adoption of the original Little Lehigh
Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance (1988) shall be the starting point
from which to consider tracts as parent tracts in which future subdivisions and
respective impervious area computations shall be cumulatively considered. For
development taking place in stages, the entire development plan must be used in
determining conformance with these criteria. Additional impervious cover shall
include, but not be limited to, additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages,
driveways, storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or
driveway areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or for
the proposed regulated activity. Any additional areas proposed to initially be
gravel, crushed stone, porous pavement, etc. shall be assumed to be impervious
for the purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria. Any existing gravel,
crushed stone or hard packed soil areas on a site shall be considered as pervious
cover for the purpose of exemption evaluation. All of the impervious cover added
incrementally to a site above the initial 10,000 square feet shall be subject to the
provisions of this Part. If a site has previously received an exemption and is proposing
additional development such that the total impervious cover on the site exceeds
10,000 square feet, the total impervious cover on the site proposed since the
original ordinance date must meet the provisions of this Part;
2. Prior drainage plan approval. Any regulated activity for which a drainage plan
was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land development proposal
that received preliminary plan approval from the Municipality prior to the effective
date of this Part is exempt from the drainage plan preparation provisions of
this Part, except as cited in subsection (C), provided that the approved drainage
plan included design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site currently
proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance provisions in effect
at the time of approval and the approval has not lapsed under the Municipalities
Planning Code. If significant revisions are made to the drainage plan after
both the preliminary plan approval and the effective date of this Part, preparation
of a new drainage plan, subject to the provisions of this Part, shall be required.
Significant revisions would include a change in control methods or techniques, relocation
or redesign of control measures or changes necessary because soil or other
conditions are not as stated on the original drainage plan.
3. These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing such measures
as are necessary to protect health, safety, property and State water quality
requirements. These measures include adequate and safe conveyance of stormwater

storm runoff based on calculations made in conformance with §227 for the onehundred-
year return period runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of onehalf
foot above the design water surface level. The terms of the easement shall
prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement.
Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper runoff conveyance
shall be required. Watercourses for which the one-hundred-year floodplain is formally
defined are subject to the applicable Municipal floodplain regulations.

Where WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet
c = rational method postdevelopment runoff coefficient for the two-year
storm
P = 1.25 inches
A= Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff volume from predevelopment
to postdevelopment for the two-year return period storm. The effect
of closed depressions on the site shall be considered in this calculation. The larger
of these two calculated volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and
treated, except that in no case shall the WQv be permitted to exceed 1.25 inches
of runoff over the site area.
3. The WQv shall be calculated for each postdevelopment drainage direction on a site
for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious cover and no proposed disturbance

a preliminary site investigation on the portion of the site that is judged to be the
best candidate hydrogeologically for possible infiltration, including gathering data
from published sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit
and a minimum of two percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G. This investi-
26-26 12/19/2005
(26, Part 2)
gation will determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal high water table,
soil permeability and location of special geologic features, if applicable. The location(
s) of special geologic features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical professional.
9. Noncarbonate areas infiltration criteria.
A. For entirely noncarbonate sites, the WQv shall be infiltrated unless the applicant
demonstrates that it is infeasible to infiltrate the WQv for reasons of
seasonal high water table, permeability rate, soil depth or isolation distances;
or except as provided in subsection (20). The preliminary site investigation
described in subsection (8) shall continue on different areas of the
site until a suitable infiltration location is found or the entire site is determined
to be infeasible for infiltration. For proposed infiltration areas, the
additional site investigation and testing as outlined in Appendix G shall be
completed. The Municipality may determine infiltration to be infeasible if
there are known existing conditions or problems that may be worsened by
the use of infiltration. The following conditions are suitable for infiltration
in noncarbonate areas:
(1) Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal to
two feet.
(2) Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet. (If the depth to bedrock is. between
two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high water table is
not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the depth to seasonal
high water table is required.)
(3) Soil permeability greater than or equal to 0.5 inches/hour and less
than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
( 4) Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(a) 100 feet from water supply wells.
{b) 10 feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building foundations.
(c) 50 feet from septic system drainfields.
(d) 50 feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock unless a
preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate bedrock
to show the absence of special geologic features within 50 feet of
the proposed infiltration area.
12119/2005 26-27
WATER
(e) 100 feet from the property line, unless documentation is provided
to show that all setbacks from wells, foundations and
drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
B. If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full WQv, the applicant shall infiltrate
that portion of the WQv that is feasible based on the site characteristics.
10. Carbonate sites infiltration criteria.
A. In entirely carbonate areas, in addition to the testing required in subsection
(8), the preliminary site investigation shall include an assessment of the
remainder of the site for possible infiltration based on required isolation distances
from special geologic features and the likely soil depth and permeability
based on published data or other site data available, Where infiltration
BMPs are proposed, the applicant shall conduct the additional site investigation
and testing as outlined in Appendix G. The soil depth, percolation
rate and proposed loading rate, each weighted as described in §227,
along with the buffer from special geologic features shall be compared to the
Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in
Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D to determine if the site is recommended
for infiltration. If, at any point in the preliminary site investigation, the
data (e.g., location of karst features on the site or the published soils data
for the site) indicates that the entire site will not be recommended for infiltration
based on the ordinance standards, then no further investigation is
required. In addition to the recommendation from Appendix D, the following
conditions are required for infiltration in carbonate areas:
(1) Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal to
two feet.
(2) Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet. (If the depth to bedrock is between
two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high water table is
not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the depth to seasonal
high water table is required.)
(3) Soil permeability greater than or equal to 0.5 inches/hour and less
than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
( 4) Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(a) 100 feet from water supply wells.
(b) 10 feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building foundations.
(c) 50 feet from septic system drainfields.
26-28 12/19/2005
(26, Part 2)
(d) 100 feet from the property line unless documentation is provided
to show that all setbacks from wells, foundations and drainfields
on neighboring properties will be met.
B. Applicants are not required to use infiltration BMPs on a carbonate site
even if the site falls in the recommended range on the chart in Appendix D.
If infiltration is not proposed, the WQv shall be treated by two acceptable
BMPs, as specified in subsection (15).
11. If a site has both carbonate and noncarbonate areas, the applicant shall investigate
the ability of the noncarbonate portion of the site to fully meet this Part to
control runoff for the whole site through infiltration. If that proves infeasible, the
applicant shall perform the preliminary site investigation for the carbonate area
to determine the appropriate design strategy. No infiltration structure in the noncarbonate
area shall be located within 50 feet of a boundary with carbonate bedrock,
except when a preliminary site investigation has been done showing the absence
of special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
12 If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the postdevelopment twoyear
runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80% or more of the predevelopment
runoff volume for the carbonate portion of the site to prevent infiltration of volumes
far in excess of the predevelopment infiltration volume.
13. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance and compaction,
except as necessary for construction of infiltration BMPs.
14. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the WQv shall
be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each discharge location. Sheet
flow draining across a pervious area can be considered as one BMP. Sheet flow
across impervious areas and concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If
sheet flow from an impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one
BMP, the length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length
of impervious area. In no case may the same BMP be employed consecutively to
meet this requirement. Acceptable BMPs are listed below along with the recommended
reference for design.

17. Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be placed in or on a special geologic feature(
s). Additionally, stormwater runoff shall not be discharged into existing onsite
sinkholes.
18. Applicants shall request, in writing, public water suppliers to provide the Zone I
wellhead protection radius, as calculated by the method outlined in the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection Wellhead Protection regulations,
for any public water supply well within 400 feet of the site. In addition to the setback
distances specified in subsections (9) and (10), infiltration is prohibited in the
Zone I radius as defined and substantiated by the public water supplier in writing.
If the applicant does not receive a response from the public water supplier,
the Zone I radius is assumed to be 100 feet.
19. The volume and rate of the net increase in stormwater runoff from the regulated
activities must be managed to prevent the physical degradation of receiving waters
from such effects as scour and streambank destabilization, to satisfy State
water quality requirements.
20. The Municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative methods
for meeting the State water quality requirements other than those in this Section,
provided that they meet the minimum requirements of and do not conflict with
State law including, but not limited to, the Clean Streams Law.

(Ord. 741, 3/8/2005, Art. 6, §304)
§225. Stormwater Management Districts.
1. Mapping of Stormwater Management Districts. To implement the provisions of
the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed Stormwater Management Plan, the Municipality
is hereby divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the
Little Lehigh Creek Release Rate Map presented in the Plan. The boundaries of
the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is
available for inspection at the Municipal office. A copy of the official map at a reduced
scale is included in Appendix A for general reference. 3
2. Description of Stormwater Management Districts. Two types of stormwater management
districts may be applicable to the Municipality, namely conditional no
detention districts and dual release rate districts as described below.
A. Conditional No Detention Districts. Within these districts, the capacity of
the local runoff conveyance facilities [as defined in subpart (B)] must be calculated
to determine if adequate capacity exists. For this determination, the
developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as
proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing
condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the
entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development
would use the runoff controls specified by this Part. The larger of
the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity
exists. If adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site
to the main channel [as defined in subpart (8)], these watershed areas may
discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities. If the
capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack
adequate capacity, the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control
or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased
peak flows consistent with §226(16). Any capacity improvements must be
designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement
consistent with the capacity criteria specified in §226( 4). By
definition, a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff
conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist.
B. Dual Release Rate Districts. Within this district, the two-year postdevelopment
peak runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment two-year
runoff peak. Further, the ten-year, twenty-five-year and one-hundred-year
postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of
the predevelopment peak. Release Rates associated with the ten- through
one-hundred-year events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in
the watershed.
a Editor's Note: Said document is available at the Borough offices.
26-34 12/19/2005
(26, Part 2)
(Ord. 741, 3/8/2005, Art. 6, §305)
§226. Stormwater Management District Implementation Provisions.
1. Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and postconstruction stormwater
management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and for the site
overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Part.
2. Any stormwater management controls required by this Part and subject to a dual
release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the
two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year return period runoff events consistent
with the calculation methodology specified in §227.
3. The exact location of the Stormwater Management District boundaries as they
apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries
using the two-foot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan. The
District boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or, in
certain instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical
feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow
obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical feature is the downstream
limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point
upslope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour
lines.
4. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this Part shall
use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak
flow rates:
A. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the increased
runoff associated with a two-year return period event within their
banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.
B. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the increased
twenty-five-year return period runoff without creating any hazard
to persons or property.
C. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or
convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with
Department of Environmental Protection Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable)
and, at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
5. For a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea,
the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria. For
development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge, individual drain-
12/19/2005 26-35
WATER
age directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total
runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
6. For a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas,
the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment
peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate. The calculated
peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan
changes the drainage area by subarea. An exception to the above may be granted
if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site. In this
case, peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that
the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
7. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category
subarea and partially within a conditional no-detention subarea, a significant portion
of the site area subject to the release rate control may not be drained to the
discharge point(s) located in the no-detention subarea except as part of a no harm
or hardship waiver procedure.
8. No portion of a site may be regraded between the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed
and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure.
9. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site which has
areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design release from the site will be
the lesser of (A) the applicable release rate flow assuming no closed depression(s)
or (B) the existing peak flow actually leaving the site. In cases where (B) would
result in an unreasonably small design release, the design discharge of less than
or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream conveyance
capacity to the main channel calculated using subsection (4) and the
minimum orifice criteria.
10. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not subject to
release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates. However, onsite
drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the
development site using the capacity criteria in subsection (4) and the detention
criteria in §227.
11. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention ponds shall
be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied to all site tributary areas
to the proposed pond discharge direction. All site tributary areas will be assumed
as developed, regardless of whether all site tributary areas are proposed
for development at that time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention
ponds in series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
12. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly
from the total site area, only the proposed impact area shall be subject
26-36 12/19/2005
(26, Part 2)
to the release rate criteria. The impact area includes any proposed cover or grading
changes.
13. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other means, do
not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site compared
to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions of this Part.
14. No Harm Water Quantity Option.
A. For any proposed development site not located in a conditional no-detention
district, the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control
(including no detention) if the developer can prove that special circumstances
exist for the proposed development site and that no harm would be
caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the
Plan. Special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects
of the development itself not specifically considered in the development
of the Plan runoff control strategy. Proof of no harm would have to be
shown from the development site through the remainder of the downstream
drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the Lehigh River. Proof
of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in subsection
( 4) if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification.
B. Attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity
analysis shall be governed by the following provisions:
(1) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design
return period storms (two-, 10-, 25- and 100-year) shall be the values
from the calibrated WATERSHED model for the Little Lehigh Creek
or as calculated by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable
to the Municipality. The flow values from the WATERSHED model
would be supplied to the developer by the Municipality upon request.
(2) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as
documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion
to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream
undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity (i.e., if his or her site
is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage, he or she may use up to
10% of the documented downstream available capacity).
(3) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate increased
peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would, by definition,
be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm, except in
conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas
consistent with subsection (16).
C. Any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of
the drainage plan submission per subpart D.
12/19/2005 26-37
WATER
15. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study area, it may
be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for more than one development
site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site.
The initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are theresponsibility
of prospective developers. The design of any regional control basins
must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The
peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required release
rate at the point of discharge.
16. Capacity Improvements.
A. In certain instances, primarily within the conditional no-detention areas,
local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control
than those based upon protection of the entire watershed. In these instances,
if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity
improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage
network, then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer
in lieu of runoff controls on the development site. Peak flow calculations
shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition
and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current
zoning and using the specified runoff controls. Any capacity improvements
would be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity
criteria specified in subsection (4). All new development in the entire subarea(
s) within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed
to implement the developer's proposed discharge control, if any.
B. Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement
any regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option
which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less
stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream.
(Ord. 7 41, 3/8/2005, Art. 3, §306)
§227. Calculation Methodology.
1. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using either the
rational method or the soil-cover-complex methodology.
2. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration
Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D
shall be calculated as follows:
(
Area Tributary to infiltration BMP )* 1 OO%
Base area of infiltration BMP
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as follows:
26-38 12/19/2005
All disturbed areas to be made weight at 100%
. .
1m pervwus:
All disturbed areas to be made weight at 50%
pervious:
All undisturbed pervious areas: weight at 0%
All existing impervious areas: weight at 100%
(26, Part 2)
3. Measurement of Soil Thickness.
A. Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed infiltration
system. The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration
Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix
Dis the measured soil thickness multiplied by the thickness factor based on
soil permeability, as follows:
Permeability Range** Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour 1.4
0. 7 5 to 1. 0 inches/hour 1.2
I
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hour 1.0
** If the permeability rate falls on a break between two thickness factors,
the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
B. Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 in./hr. or less than 0.5 in./hr.
are not recommended for infiltration.
4. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of this Part
shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through the proposed basin
using the storage indication method or other methodology demonstrated to be
more appropriate. For basins designed using the rational method technique, the
design hydrograph for routing shall be either the Universal Rational Hydrograph
or the modified rational method trapezoidal hydrograph which maximizes detention
volume. Use of the modified rational hydrograph shall be consistent with the
procedure described in Section "PIPE.RAT" of the Users' Manual for the Penn
State Urban Hydrograph Method (1987).
5. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface runoff or pipe
flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
6. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface runoff or pipe
flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below the lowest outlet invert.
12/19/2005 26-39
WATER
7. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv shall assume
that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet is full at the beginning
of design event routing for the purposes of evaluating peak outflows.
8. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum 1.0-foot freeboard
above the maximum pool elevation associated with the two- through twenty-fiveyear
runoff events. A 0.5-foot freeboard shall be provided above the maximum pool
elevation of the one-hundred-year runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured
from the maximum pool elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The
two- through one-hundred-year storm events shall be controlled by the primary
outlet structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to pass
the one-hundred-year return frequency storm peak basin inflow rate with a minimum
0.5-foot freeboard measured to the top of the basin. The freeboard criteria

velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or the modified kinematic
wave travel time equation (equation 3-3, NRCS TR-55, June 1986).
If using the modified kinematic wave travel time equation, the sheet flow
length shall be limited to 50 feet for designs using the rational method and
limited to 150 feet for designs using the soil-cover-complex method.
B. Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from the watercourse
slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure 3-1 of TR-55, June
1986.
C. Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities calculated
by the Manning Equation. Bankfull flows shall be used for determining
velocities. Manning 'n' values shall be based on the table presented in
Appendix C.
D. Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities calculated using
the Manning Equation assuming full flow and the Manning 'n' values from
Appendix C.
15. If using the rational method, all predevelopment calculations for a given discharge
direction shall be based on a common time of concentration considering both onsite
and any off-site drainage areas. If using the rational method, all postdevelopment
calculations for a given discharge direction shall be based on a common
time of concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
16. The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of watercourses.
Manning 'n' values used in the calculations shall be consistent with the table presented
in Appendix C or other appropriate standard engineering 'n' value resources.
Pipe capacities shall be determined by methods acceptable to the Municipality.

schedule adopted by the Municipality. A copy of the waiver request shall be provided
to each of the following: Municipality, Municipal engineer, Municipal solicitor
and Lehigh Valley Planning Commission. The request shall fully document the
nature of the alleged hardship.
A. The Municipality may grant a waiver provided that all of the following findings
are made in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the circumstances
or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Part
in the Stormwater Management District in which the property is located;
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this Part, including the no harm provisions, and that
26-46 12/19/2005
(26, Part 2)
the authorization of a waiver is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable
use of the property;
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant;
(4) That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the m1n1mum waiver
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible
of the regulation in issue; and
(5) That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a hardship
waiver.
B. In granting any waiver, the Municipality may attach such conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Part. If a hardship waiver is granted, the applicant must still manage the
quantity, velocity, direction and quality of resulting storm runoff as is necessary
to prevent injury to health, safety or other property.
2. For regulated activities described in §205(2)(A) and (B), the Borough Council shall
hear requests for and decide on hardship waiver requests on behalf of the Municipality.

Low Impact Development Practices
Alternative Approach for Managing Stormwater Runoff
Natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned development practices,
such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces, destroying existing drainage swales, constructing
unnecessary storm sewers, and changing local topography. A traditional drainage approach
of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it
in a detention basin. This approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well
as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some
downstream location.
The recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize postdevelopment
runoff rates and volumes, which will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage
facilities. To simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions, forced infiltration is often necessary
to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces. The ability of the ground to
infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions.
Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design considerations.
Site design practices include preserving natural drainage features, minimizing impervious surface
area, reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces, and protecting natural depression
storage. A well-designed site will contain a mix of all those features. The following describes
various techniques to achieve the alternative approach:
• Preserving Natural Drainage Features. Protecting natural drainage features, particularly
vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate
and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants. However, this objective is often not accomplished
in land development. In fact, commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the
opposite pattern-- streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural
headwater valleys and swales, thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely
impervious system. As a result, runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces
flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation, infiltration, or filtration.
Developments designed to fit site topography also minimize the amount of grading
on site.
• Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depressional storage areas have no surface
outlet, or drain very slowly following a storm event. They can be commonly seen as
ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events. Traditional
development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining, thereby obliterating
their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and releaserate
characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site.
The depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its
storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities.
• Avoiding Introduction of Impervious Areas. Careful site planning should consider reducing
impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible. Building footprints, sidewalks,
12/19/2005 26 Attachment 8-1
WATER
driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize
impacts on runoff.
• Reducing the Hydraulic Connectivity of Impervious Surfaces. Impervious surfaces
are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance
system (such as storm sewer). Two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing
of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers. Site grading should promote
increasing travel time of stormwater runoff, and should help reduce concentration of
runoff to a single point in the development.
• Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns. Roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most
site designs. The practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or
parking lots. The practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street.
By routing roof drains and crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn, the lawn is essentially
used as a filter strip.
• Reducing the Use of Storm Sewers. By reducing use of storm sewers for draining streets,
parking lots, and back yards, the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can
be greatly reduced. The practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for
some development sites, especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a "reasonable"
time. The practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials, who
expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event.
• Reducing Street Widths. Street widths can be reduced by either eliminating on-street
parking or by reducing roadway widths. Municipal planners and traffic designers should encourage
narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could lower maintenance.
• Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one side of the street may
suffice in low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicycle/
recreational trails that follow back-of-lot lines. Where appropriate, backyard trails should
be constructed using pervious materials.
• Using Permeable Paving Materials. These materials include permeable interlocking concrete
paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete. Such materials should be considered as
alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces, especially for low use surfaces such as
driveways, overflow parking lots, and emergency access roads.
• Reducing Building Setbacks. Reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and entry
walks and is most readily accomplished along low-traffic streets where traffic noise is not a
problem.
• Constructing Cluster Developments. Cluster developments can also reduce the amount
of impervious area for a given number of lots. The biggest savings is in street length, which
also will reduce costs of the development. Cluster development clusters the construction activity
onto less-sensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development.

Preliminary Site Investigation and Testing Requirements
Required Data and Site Information: The following data shall be gathered utilizing
standard testing procedures as part of a preliminary site investigation:
Bedrock composition- Any apparent boundaries between carbonate and nonarbonate
bedrock must be verified by a qualified geotechnical professional.
Bedrock structural geology - This includes the possible presence of faults and
mapping of conspicuous fracture traces or lineaments.
Overburden and soil mantle composition and thickness.
Permeability of the soil.
Depth to the seasonal high water table.
Presence of special geologic features- "Ibis includes sinkholes, closed depressions,
fracture traces, lineaments and geologic contacts between carbonate and noncarbonate
bedrock.
Investigation Required for All Sites
Review of Available Data, Maps and Reports: Some of the required information, as
listed above, can be found in existing published data. Suggested resources include the
following:
Geologic maps and references for the development area.
The Little Lehigh Creek Basin Carbonate Prototype Area Closed Depression Map
- available at the LVPC.
USGS topographic maps.
Lehigh and Berks County soil survey maps.
Aerial photographs from the LVPC or other sources.
Relevant Pennsylvania Geologic Survey Open File Reports (Kochanov 1987a,
1987b) that provide maps of sinkholes and karst features for Lehigh and Berks
counties.
Field Inspections: In addition to gathering data from published sources, a field inspection
of the proposed site is required. A field inspection can provide additional information
relating to site features such as carbonate bedrock features, indicators of seasonal
high stream-level or water table levels, streams, springs, etc.
Soil Test Pit and Percolation Test Requirements: A minimum of one test pit and a
minimum of two percolation tests are required for every site. A test pit is a two to threefoot-
wide, eight-foot-deep trench excavated with a backhoe for observing subsurface
conditions. The test pits will be used to describe soil depth and quality, including soil
horizons, and testing of permeability or percolation rates.
12/19/2005 26 Attachment 9-1
WATER
Percolation tests are to be conducted as follows (adapted from § 73.15. Percolation Tests
of the Pennsylvania Code):
1. The percolation tests shall be made in separate holes uniformly spaced over
the possible infiltration area.
2. An "Initial Presoak" should not be performed.
3. Percolation holes located within the possible infiltration area shall be used
in the calculation of the average percolation rate.
4. Holes having a uniform diameter of six to 10 inches shall be bored or dug as
follows:
a. To the depth of the bottom of the possible infiltration BMP.
b. Alternate depths if the test pits/auger holes indicate that the soils
are more suitable at a different depth (i.e., if a clay horizon is identified
and more suitable soils are located beneath the horizon, and infiltration
test should be performed in the suitable horizon).
5. The bottom and sides of the hole shall be scarified with a knife blade or
sharp-pointed instrument to completely remove any smeared soil surfaces
and to provide a natural soil interface into which water may percolate.
Loose material shall be removed from the hole. Two inches of coarse sand or
fine gravel shall be placed in the bottom of the hole to protect the soil from
scouring and clogging of the pores.
6. Immediately before the percolation test, as a final presoak, water shall be
placed in the hole to a minimum depth of six-inches over the gravel and readjusted
every 30 minutes for 1 hour.
7. The drop in the water level during the last 30 minutes of the final presoaking
period shall be applied to the following standard to determine the time
interval between readings for each percolation hole:
a. If water remains in the hole, the interval for readings during the
percolation test shall be 30 minutes.
b. If no water remains in the hole, the interval for readings during the
percolation test may be reduced to 10 minutes.
8. Mter the final presoaking period, water in the hole shall again be adjusted
to approximately six-inches over the gravel and readjusted when necessary
after each reading.
a. Measurement to the water level in the individual percolation holes
shall be made from a fixed reference point and shall continue at the
interval determined from step No. 7 (above) for each individual percolation
hole until a minimum of eight readings are completed or until
a stabilized rate of drop is obtained, whichever occurs first. A stabilized
rate of drop means a difference of 1/4 of an inch or less of
26 Attachment 9-2 12/19/2005
(26, Appendix G)
drop between the highest and lowest readings of four consecutive
readings.
b. The drop that occurs in the final period in percolation test holes, expressed
as inches per hour, shall be used to calculate the average
percolation rate.
c. When the rate of drop in a percolation test is too slow to obtain a
measurable rate, the rate of 0.25 inches per hour shall be assigned
to that hole for use in calculating the average percolation rate. The
infiltration area may be placed over holes with no measurable rate
when the average percolation rate for the possible infiltration area is
within the acceptable range.
When a percolation test hole yields a percolation rate of greater than 12 inches per
hour, the proposed infiltration area may not be designed or installed within 25 feet of
this hole unless the Municipality determines that a testing anomaly caused the fast
percolation rate and a retest of the area yields acceptable percolation rates. This percolation
rate limit is established to protect groundwater quality and to minimize the risk
of subsidence.
Additional Site Investigation and Testing Required if Infiltration is Proposed
Soil Test Pit Requirements: The required number of test pits varies with Effective
Soil Thickness. As risk factors increase, the number of test pits increases. A minimum
of 2 test pits, uniformly spaced within the proposed infiltration area (e.g., the 2 pits
should be centered on each half of the proposed infiltration area), are required for any
site proposing infiltration unless the applicant can demonstrate that one test pit is adequately
representative of the area proposed for infiltration. For larger infiltration areas,
multiple test pits shall be developed at the densities as listed below:
Test Pit Density Percolation Tests
(per acre of pro- (per acre of pro- Auger Grid Spac-
Effective Soil posed infiltration posed infiltration ing (Feet On-
Thickness (ft.) area)* area)** Center)
8 4 8 50
4 to 8 6 12 35
2 to 4 8 16 25
* No. of Test Pits required - Infiltration sq. ft./43,560 sq. ft. x test pit density from chart
rounded up to the nearest whole number.
** No. of Percolation Tests required =Infiltration sq. ft./43,560 sq. ft. x percolation tests
from chart rounded up to the nearest whole number.
Soil Auger Testing Requirements for Carbonate Areas: Because soil depth is not
uniform in many carbonate areas, test pits will not be sufficient to accurately determine
the depth to bedrock. Augering provides this essential data as inexpensively as possible.
Track-rig rotary soil auger test drilling allows relatively inexpensive, qualitative determination
of the presence of overburden voids and will generally penetrate to the top-ofbedrock.
Augers typically extend to depths of 20 feet. Special augers extend to as much
12/19/2005 26 Attachment 9-3
WATER
as 50 feet. Augers do not extend into the bedrock. Auger testing should be performed in
a grid pattern across the proposed infiltration area, spaced as indicated in the above table.
Percolation Testing Requirements: A minimum of six percolation tests shall be conducted
in accordance with the procedures listed above unless the applicant can demonstrate
that fewer tests accurately represent the percolation rate of the proposed infiltration
area. Additional testing shall be required if the initial test results show significant
variability in percolation rate. For larger infiltration areas, percolation tests shall be
conducted at the densities listed in the table above.

USING THIS CHAPTER: AN OVERVIEW1
These two pages describe the most efficient way to use this Chapter. These pages are
general descriptions but are not part of the actual ordinance.
Start by using the following parts of the Zoning Ordinance:
• Please contact the Zoning Officer to make sure you have the latest version of
the Zoning Ordinance text and Map.
• Turn to the Table of Contents and the Index (at the end of the document2) to
find the pages and sections that apply to your particular situation. You may
wish to photocopy the table of contents to highlight the relevant sections.
• Consult the Zoning Map at the end of this Zoning Ordinance to determine the
zoning district that includes your lot.
• Turn to §27-306, the Table of Permitted Uses by Zoning District, which
indicates the uses permitted in each zoning district. A use is permitted in three
ways:
a) By right.
b) By special exception (the Zoning Hearing Board must approve the use, as
described in §27-116).
c) As a conditional use (the Borough Council must approve the use, as
described in §27-117).
• Turn to §27-307, the Table of Lot and Setback Requirements by Zoning
District. This table states the required minimum size of each lot and the
required minimum distance that buildings must be from streets and other lot
lines in each zoning district.
• Regularly refer to the definitions in §27-202 to determine the meaning of
specific words.
If a lot is already being legally used for a particular purpose and that use is not
permitted in the zoning district according to §27-306, that use is called a
“nonconforming use.” In almost all cases, a lawful nonconforming use can continue, can
expand within limits, can change to another use within limits, and can be sold. See §27-
805, “Nonconformities.”
1 Editor’s Note: These two pages of “Using This Chapter: An Overview” were adopted
as part of Ord. 800, 3/13/2012.
2 Editor’s Note: The Zoning Index appears at the end of the Index to the Borough of
Coplay Code of Ordinances.

ZONING
Certain specific uses must comply with additional regulations. The “principal uses”
(which are the primary use of a property) are listed in alphabetical order in §27-402 and
the “accessory uses” (which are secondary uses, such as low-intensity businesses in a
home) are listed in alphabetical order in §27-403. Additional regulations are listed for
sheds, garages and other structures typically found on a residential lot under
“residential accessory structures” in §27-403.
Turn to the following Sections for regulations concerning parking, signs and buffer
yards:
• Many uses must provide a minimum number of off-street parking spaces under
§27-601 of this Chapter. The parking standards are listed in a table.
• If signs are proposed within public view, Part 7 must be met. This Part lists
the types, heights and sizes of signs that are permitted.
• Certain uses are required to provide an open buffer yard with evergreen
screening to buffer nearby homes and adjacent residentially zoned land from
nuisances. See §27-803.
You should also keep the following additional considerations in mind when using this
Chapter:
• An applicant may apply to the Borough Zoning Hearing Board for a zoning
variance if he/she is not able to comply with a provision of this Chapter. An
application fee is required to compensate the Borough for legal advertisements
and other costs. See §27-111, which includes the standards that must be met
under State law in order to be granted a variance. Generally, under the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, variances are not permitted
unless an applicant proves a legal “hardship.”
• Generally, if one or more new lots will be created, or existing lot lines will be
altered, or one or more new principal non-residential buildings are proposed,
then the requirements and approval procedures of the Borough’s Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22] will also apply. This is a
separate ordinance available at Borough hall.3
• If there will be significant disturbance of the ground, it will be necessary to use
certain measures to control soil erosion. In such case, contact the County
Conservation District.
Any questions concerning this Chapter should be directed to the Borough’s Zoning
Officer. The Zoning Officer also administers applications for permits.

Chapter 22, Subdivision and Land Development, of this Code of Ordinances.

Municipalities Planning Code. (As of the adoption date of this Chapter, such
provisions were in §§914.1 and 1002-A, 53 P.S. §§10914.1, 11002-A).
7. Zoning Permit for Temporary Uses and Structures.
A. Temporary Uses.
27-12 12/17/2012
(27, PART 1)
(1) A zoning permit for a temporary use or structure may be issued for
customary, routine and accessory short-term special events; provided,
that:
(a) Only a nonprofit organization, governmental agency or a permitted
place of worship proposing a temporary use to clearly primarily serve
a charitable, public service or religious purpose or a Boroughsponsored
festival or Borough-sponsored special event shall be eligible
to receive approval for commercial-type activities in a district where
a commercial use would not otherwise be permitted.
(b) Such total events shall each be limited to a maximum of 10 total days
per calendar year.
(c) The applicant shall prove to the Borough that sufficient parking and
traffic control will be available for the special event, without
obstructing parking that is required to serve other uses on the site.
(2) A zoning permit may be issued for temporary storage and office trailers
that are necessary to serve on-site construction, while such construction
is actively underway under a valid Borough permit.
(3) In addition, Christmas tree sales shall be allowed by right in commercial
and industrial districts and on property owned by a fire company or the
Borough.
(4) The Borough may also approve the construction of a model home, which
is used as a sales office in a development, provided the building is
converted to a dwelling when the development is complete. Alternatively,
a modular sales office may be allowed by the Borough provided it is
removed completely when the development is complete.
(5) Portable storage containers–see §27-807.
B. Time Period. The Zoning Officer shall state a reasonable maximum time period
on the temporary permit. If no time limit is stated, then a 10-day maximum
period shall apply. A temporary permit may be renewed for just cause.
C. Temporary Retail Sales.
(1) Except as may otherwise be allowed by Subsection .A above, a lot shall
only be used for temporary retail sales if all of the following conditions are
met:
(a) The property shall be located within a zoning district that allows
retail sales.
12/17/2012 27-13
ZONING
(b) No more than 5% of the off-street parking spaces shall be obstructed by
tents or structures that are required to serve permanent uses on the lot.
(c) Any signs visible from a public street shall comply with this Chapter.
(d) If food or beverages are sold that are not pre-packaged, the applicant
shall prove compliance with State health regulations, including having
on-site facilities for workers to wash their hands.
(e) A zoning permit shall be required from the Borough, which shall be
displayed while the activity is open for business.
(f) The application may be rejected if the Zoning Officer has reason to
believe that the activity would obstruct safe sight distances.
(2) This Subsection C. shall not apply to: sale of agricultural produce that was
grown by the operator of the sales, and flower and plant sales as accessory to
a commercial use.
8. Compliance with Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22]. If an
application under this Chapter would also be regulated by the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance ("SALDO") [Chapter 22], then any permit or approval under
this Chapter shall automatically be conditioned upon compliance with the SALDO. See
the definitions of "land development" and "subdivision" in the SALDO.
A. For example, if an applicant applies for a single-family detached dwelling on a
proposed new lot, the construction permit for such dwelling shall not be valid
until after the lot is granted final subdivision approval and the lot is officially
recorded by the County Recorder of Deeds.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §103; as amended by Ord. 837, 3/12/2019, § 2)
§27-104. General Procedure for Permits.
1. After receiving a proper application, the Zoning Officer shall either: (A) issue the
applicable permit(s) or (B) deny the application(s) as submitted, indicating one or more
reasons.
2. After the permit under this Chapter has been issued, the applicant may undertake the
action specified by the permit, in compliance with other Borough ordinances.
2019 S-4 27-14
(27, PART 1)
However, it is recommended that applicants wait 30 days to begin construction if
there is a possibility of an appeal by another party to have the permit revoked. Any
commencement of construction or a use within this 30-day appeal period shall be
at the risk of the applicant.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §104)
§27-105. Interpretation and Uses Not Regulated.
1. Minimum Requirements. Where more than one provision of this Chapter controls
a particular matter, the provision that is more restrictive upon uses and structures
shall apply. The provisions of this Chapter are in addition to any other applicable
Borough ordinance.
2. Uses Not Specifically Regulated. If a use clearly is not permitted by right, as a
conditional use, or as a special exception use by this Chapter within any zoning
district, the use is prohibited, except that the Zoning Hearing Board may permit
such use as a special exception use if the applicant specifically proves to the clear
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that all of the following conditions would
be met:
A. The proposed use would be no more intensive with respect to external impacts

in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation
until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by
the district justice, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorney’s fees collected for the violation of this Chapter shall be paid over

person, entity or the Borough Council that the Zoning Officer has
improperly acted under the requirements and procedures of this Chapter.

State law. As of the adoption date of this Chapter, the Municipalities
Planning Code provided that all of the following findings must be made,
where relevant:
(a) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions (including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property) and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created
by the provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located.
(b) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this Chapter and a variance is therefore necessary
to enable the reasonable use of the property.
(c) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
(d) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(e) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that
will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
27-20 12/17/2012
(27, PART 1)
(3) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this Chapter.

(1) The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special exceptions filed
with the Borough staff in writing. The Board shall only permit a special
exception that is authorized by this Chapter. See §27-116.

opportunity to review a special exception application. However, action by
the Zoning Hearing Board shall not be delayed by a Planning Commission
review.
(3) Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board
may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to
those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes and intent of this Chapter.
E. Persons with Disabilities. After the Zoning Officer receives a complete written
application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall grant a special exception allowing
modifications to specific requirements of this Chapter that the applicant proves
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board are required under applicable
Federal law to provide a “reasonable accommodation” to serve persons who the
applicant proves have “disabilities” as defined in and protected by such laws.
(1) Such reasonable accommodations shall be requested in accordance with
the U.S. Fair Housing Act Amendments and/or the Americans with
Disabilities Act, as amended.
(2) If the applicant is requesting a reasonable accommodation under the
United States Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 or the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the applicant shall identify the disability which is
protected by such statutes, the extent of the modification of the provisions
of this Chapter necessary for a reasonable accommodation, and the
manner by which the reasonable accommodation requested may be
removed when such person(s) with a protected disability no longer will be
present on the property.
(3) Any modification approved under this Section may be limited to the time
period during which the persons with disabilities occupy or utilize the
premises.
F. The Zoning Hearing Board shall also hear any other matters as set forth in the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. (Note: As of the
adoption date of this Chapter, such provisions were primarily within §909.1 of
such law, 53 P.S. §10909.1.)

exception or conditional use approval) is officially authorized, then any
applicable zoning and building permits shall be secured by the applicant
within 12 months after the date of such approval or authorization. The work
authorized by zoning permits shall then be substantially completed within 12
months after the issuance of the zoning permit, unless a longer time period is
provided under Borough construction permits or as provided in Subsection .B
below.
(1) However, if a variance is approved to address a violation of this Chapter,

C. If an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits or begin construction
within the above time periods, or allows interruptions in substantial
construction of longer than 12 months, the Zoning Officer shall conclusively
presume that the applicant has waived, withdrawn or abandoned approvals,
variances and permits under this Chapter and all such approvals, variances
and permits shall be deemed automatically rescinded by the Borough.

be pending before the Zoning Hearing Board for special exception approval at any
time.

Municipalities Planning Code.
A. Submittal. A site plan shall be submitted, which shall contain the information

determine whether the proposed conditional use would meet the applicable
requirements of this Chapter. The same standards shall apply to a conditional use
as are listed in §27-116.3 for a special exception use.
4. Conditions. In approving conditional use applications, the Borough Council may
attach conditions they consider necessary to protect the public welfare and meet
27-26 12/17/2012
(27, PART 1)
the standards of this Chapter. These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning

approval or permit under this Chapter by an officer, employee, board, commission,
solicitor, consultant or agency of the Borough shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee or warranty of any kind by the Borough, or its employees, officials,

procedures specified in the State Municipalities Planning Code. All changes should
be noted by date with a brief description of the nature of the change, either on the
map or within an appendix to this Chapter.

The following rules shall apply where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district
as shown on the Zoning Map.

of street rights-of-way, streams and railroads, and lot lines as they existed on
a recorded deed or plan of record in the County Recorder of Deeds office at the
time of the adoption of this Chapter, unless such district boundary lines are
fixed by dimensions as shown on the Official Coplay Borough Zoning Map.
B. Where a district boundary is not fixed by dimensions and where it
approximately follows lot lines, such boundary shall be construed to follow
such lot lines unless specifically shown otherwise.
C. The location of a district boundary on un-subdivided land or where a district
boundary divides a lot shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing
on the Zoning Map unless indicated otherwise by dimensions.
D. Where a municipal boundary divides a lot, the minimum lot area shall be
regulated by the municipality in which the principal use(s) are located, unless
otherwise provided by applicable case law. The land area within each
municipality shall be regulated by the use regulations and other applicable
regulations of each municipality.

proposed within Coplay Borough regardless of whether such abutting existing
dwelling or principally residential zoning district is located in an abutting
municipality and/or in Coplay Borough.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC USES
§27-401. Applicability.
This Part establishes additional specific requirements for certain specific uses, in
addition to the sign, parking, environmental and other general requirements of this
Chapter and the requirements of each district. Wherever two requirements conflict, the
stricter requirement shall apply.
A. For uses allowed within a specific zoning district as “special exception” uses,
see also the procedures and standards in §27-116. For conditional uses, see
also §27-117.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §401)
§27-402. Additional Requirements for Specific Principal Uses.
Each of the following uses shall meet all of the following requirements for that use:
A. Adult Use. (This is limited to the following: adult store, adult movie theater,
massage parlor, or adult live entertainment facility.)
(1) Purposes. The regulations on adult uses are intended to serve the
following purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of this Chapter.
(a) To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses that affect
health, safety and general welfare concerns of the Borough. These
secondary impacts have been documented in research conducted
across the nation. These secondary impacts typically include, but are
not limited to: increases in criminal activity, increases in activities
that increase the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted
diseases, increases in activities that increase the risk of transmission
of other communicable diseases, increases in blight, decreases in the
stability of residential neighborhoods, and decreases in property
values for surrounding homes, and decreases in the marketability of
nearby commercial business space. The research conducted across the
nation concludes that adult uses typically involve insufficient selfregulation
to control these secondary effects.
(b) To limit adult uses to locations where these secondary impacts can be
minimized, particularly as they affect residential neighborhoods and
commercial revitalization.
12/17/2012 27-81
ZONING
(3) To not attempt to suppress any activities protected by the “free
speech” protections of the State and U.S. Constitutions, but instead
to control secondary effects.
(2) An adult use and its parking area shall not be located within any of the
following distances, whichever is most restrictive:
(a) Two hundred lineal feet from the lot line of an existing dwelling.
(b) Four hundred lineal feet from the lot line of any lot in a residential
zoning district.
(c) One thousand lineal feet from the lot line of any primary or secondary
school, place of worship, library, public park or playground, recreation
trail, day care center or nursery school.
(3) No adult use shall be located within 1,000 lineal feet from any existing
“adult use.”
(4) A 50-foot buffer yard shall be provided, regardless of zoning district, along
the side and rear lot lines. If such buffer area does not include substantial
mature trees that will be preserved, it shall include continuous screening
by evergreen trees with an initial height of five feet.
(5) No pornographic material, displays or words shall be placed in view of
persons who are not inside of the establishment. Definite precautions shall
be made to prohibit minors from entering the premises.
(6) No adult use shall be used for any purpose that violates any Federal, State
or municipal law.
(7) Pornographic and sexually explicit signs and displays shall be prohibited
that are visible from outside of the premises.
(8) The adult use shall not include the sale or display of “obscene” materials,
as defined by Pennsylvania criminal law, as may be amended by
applicable court decisions.
(9) An adult use shall be prohibited in all districts except where specifically
allowed under §27-306. An adult use is a distinct use, and shall not be
allowed under any other use, such as a retail store or club.
(10) A minimum lot area of one acre is required.
(11) For public health reasons, private or semi-private viewing booths of any
kind are prohibited. This specifically includes, but is not limited to, booths
for viewing adult movies or nude dancers.
27-82 12/17/2012
(27, PART 4)
(12) No use may include live actual or simulated sex acts nor any physical or
sexual contact between employees and entertainers nor or between
employees or entertainers and customers. At an adult live entertainment
use, employees, dancers or entertainers shall maintain a minimum
distance of two feet from customers. This shall include, but not be limited
to, a prohibition on “lap dancing.”
(13) All persons within any adult use shall wear non-transparent garments
that cover their genitals and the female areola, except within a permitted
lawful “adult live entertainment facility.”
(14) Any application for such use shall state the names and home addresses of
an on-site manager responsible to ensure compliance with this Chapter on
a daily basis. A telephone number shall be provided where the on-site
manager can be reached during Borough business hours. Such information
shall be updated whenever it changes in writing to the Zoning Officer.
(15) The use shall not operate between the hours of 12 midnight and 7:00 a.m.
(16) As specific conditions of approval under this Chapter, the applicant shall
prove compliance, where applicable, with the following State laws, as
amended: the Pennsylvania Liquor Code, Act 219 of 1990 (which pertains
to sale or consumption of alcohol between 2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.), Act 207
of 1990 (which pertains to obscenity) and Act 120 of 1996 (which pertains
to adult-oriented establishments and which limits enclosed viewing booths
among other matters).
(17) An adult use shall not be on the same lot as a use that sells alcoholic
beverages.
B. Adult Day Care Center.
(1) The use shall be fully licensed by the State, if required by the State.
(2) The use shall include constant supervision during all hours of operation.
(3) The use shall not meet the definition of a “treatment center.”
C. Airport (see also “heliport”).
(1) As part of a conditional use approval for the establishment or expansion
of an airport, the applicant shall describe the maximum sizes and types of
aircraft that are intended to use the facility, as well as the primary
approaches.
(2) Provided that the conditions to not conflict with Federal and State safety
standards, the Borough Council may place reasonable conditions upon the
use to minimize noise conflicts to adjacent residential areas.
12/17/2012 27-83
ZONING
D. Animal Cemetery.
(1) All the regulations for a “cemetery” in this Section shall apply.
(2) The applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that the
use will be conducted in such a manner that the public health and

H. Auto Repair Garage.
(1) All paint work shall be performed within a building, with a fume collection
and ventilation system that directs fumes away from any adjacent
dwellings. Outdoor major repairs (such as body work and grinding) and
outdoor welding shall not occur within 100 feet of a “residential lot line.”
(2) All reasonable efforts shall be made to prevent or minimize noise, odor,
vibration, light or electrical interference to adjacent lots. See standards in
Part 5. See buffer yard requirements in §27-803.
(3) Outdoor storage of motor vehicles shall not be within any required buffer
yard or street right-of-way.

under repair. A maximum of 10 junk vehicles may be parked on a lot
outside of an enclosed building at any one time, unless they are actively
under repair.
27-84 12/17/2012
(27, PART 4)
(6) Service bay doors shall not face directly towards an abutting dwelling (not
including a dwelling separated from the garage by a street) if another
reasonable alternative exits.
I. Auto Service Station.
(1) See definition of this term and “auto repair garage” in Part 2. The uses
may be combined, if the requirements for each are met.
(2) All activities except those to be performed at the fuel or air pumps shall
be performed within a building. The use shall not include spray painting.
(3) Fuel pumps shall be at least 25 feet from the existing street right-of-way

shall be “relatives” of the permanent residents of the principal dwelling
unit. At least one resident of the accessory unit shall need such
accommodations because of an illness, old age or disability.
(3) The applicant shall prove to the Zoning Officer that the accessory unit has
been designed and constructed so that it can be easily reconverted into
part of the principal dwelling unit or is a modular cottage that will be
completely removed from the lot after the relative no longer resides within
the unit. Such accessory unit may be converted into an additional
bedroom(s), permitted home occupation area or similar use. A lawful
detached garage may be converted into a unit for care of relative, and then
be reconverted to a garage or permitted home occupation area or otherwise
function as part of the principal dwelling unit.
(4) The applicant shall establish a legally binding mechanism in a form
acceptable to the Borough that will prohibit the use of the accessory unit
as a separate dwelling unit after the relative no longer resides within the
unit. Such mechanism shall also be binding upon future owners.
(5) The owner of the property shall be required to annually renew the permit
for the use. Such renewal shall be conditioned upon the owner proving
that a relative of the occupants of the principal dwelling unit continues to
reside within the accessory unit.
(6) Such accessory unit shall not decrease the one-family residential
appearance of a one-family dwelling, as viewed from exterior property
lines. The accessory unit shall be attached to the principal dwelling unit,
except a detached dwelling may be specifically approved by the Zoning
Hearing Board as a special exception. If a detached modular dwelling is
placed on the property, it shall be completely removed within 90 days after
the relative no longer lives within it. A detached dwelling shall only be
placed on the lot if it will meet principal building setbacks and has a
maximum building floor area of 900 square feet.

(27, PART 4)
another lot, unless a written waiver is provided by the owner of such
building.
(3) The owner of the facility shall completely remove all above ground
structures within 12 months after the windmill is no longer used to
generate electricity.
(4) A wind turbine shall not be climbable for at least the first 12 feet above
the ground level, unless it is surrounded by a fence with a minimum
height of six feet.
(5) All wind turbines shall be set back from the nearest public street right-ofway
a minimum distance equal to the total maximum height to the top of
the extended blade.
(6) If guy wires are used, and they are not within a fence, they shall be
marked near their base with reflectors, reflective tape or similar method.
(7) The turbine shall include automatic devices to address highspeed winds,
such as mechanical brakes and overspeed controls.
(8) In an R-M, R-S, MHP or R-S1 District, the maximum total height above
the ground level to the tip of the extended blade shall be 90 feet. In
another district, the maximum height for a wind turbine approved under
this Section shall be 150 feet. See wind turbines in §§27-402 and 27-306
for taller turbines.

the maximum extent feasible.
(10) Contiguous property owners may construct a wind turbine for use in
common, provided that the required setbacks are maintained from the lot
lines of nonparticipating landowners. A maximum of one wind turbine that
would be shared by certain dwelling units within a development may also
be placed in the common open space, if specifically approved to be
included, at the time of final subdivision approval.

This Section shall only regulate exterior lighting that spills across lot lines or onto
public streets.
A. Street Lighting Exempted. This Section shall not apply to: (1) street lighting
that is owned, financed or maintained by the Borough or the State, or (2) an
individual porch light of less than six feet total height in a front yard (not
including a spot light).
B. Height of Lights. No luminary, spotlight or other light source that is within
200 feet of a lot line of an existing dwelling or approved residential lot shall be
placed at a height exceeding 35 feet above the average surrounding ground
level. This limitation shall not apply to lights needed for air safety nor lights
intended solely to illuminate an architectural feature of a building, nor lighting
of outdoor public recreation facilities or a ski resort.
C. Diffused. All light sources, including signs, shall be properly diffused as needed
with a translucent or similar cover to prevent exposed bulbs from being
directly visible from streets, public sidewalks, dwellings or adjacent lots.
D. Shielding. All light sources, including signs, shall be shielded around the light
source and carefully directed and placed to prevent the lighting from creating
a nuisance to reasonable persons in adjacent dwellings, and to prevent the
lighting from shining into the eyes of passing motorists.
E. Flickering. Flashing, flickering or strobe lighting are prohibited, except for
non-advertising seasonal lights between October 25 and January 10.
F. Spillover. Exterior lighting on an institutional, commercial or industrial
property shall not cause a spillover of light onto a residential lot that exceeds
one horizontal foot-candle at a distance 10 feet inside the residential lot line.
G. Gasoline Sales Canopies. Any canopy over gasoline pumps shall have light
fixtures recessed into the canopy or screened by an extension around the
bottom of the canopy so that lighting elements are not visible from another lot
or street.
H. Lighting of Horizontal Surfaces. For the lighting of predominantly horizontal
surfaces such as parking areas and vehicle sales areas, lighting fixtures shall
be aimed downward and shall include full cut-off measures as needed to
properly direct the light and to meet the maximum spillover requirements of
Subsection . F and to prevent glare onto streets. The Borough may require that
light fixtures for nonresidential uses be placed along the street and be aimed
away from the street in a manner that also minimizes light shining onto
residential lots.
I. Lighting of Non-horizontal Surfaces. For lighting of predominantly nonhorizontal
surfaces such building walls and wall signs, lighting fixtures shall
be fully shielded and shall be aimed so as to not project light towards
neighboring residences or past the object being illuminated or skyward. Any
12/17/2012 27-121

§27-508. Wetlands and Waterway Conservation.
1. Wetland Studies. It shall be the responsibility of each applicant to determine
whether land areas proposed for alteration meet the Federal or State definition of
a wetland prior to submittal of development plans to the Borough. If the Zoning
Officer has reason to believe that wetlands may be present on a site proposed for
development or subdivision, the Zoning Officer may require that the applicant
provide a suitable wetland delineation study prepared by a qualified professional.
2. Setback from Waterways. No new principal building, no new off-street parking
spaces and no new commercial or industrial outdoor storage shall be allowed within
75 feet from the average centerline of the Lehigh River. Where trees and other
natural vegetation are removed within this setback, they shall be replaced with
new trees and vegetation that serve the same environmental purposes.

1. General. Parking spaces and accessways shall be laid out to result in safe and orderly
use, and to fully take into account all of the following: vehicular access onto and off the
site, vehicular movement within the site, loading areas, pedestrian patterns and any
drive-thru facilities. No parking area shall cause a safety hazard or impediment to
traffic off the lot.
2. Existing Parking.
A. Any parking spaces serving such pre-existing structures or uses at the time of
adoption of this Chapter shall not in the future be reduced in number below the
number required by this Chapter.
2019 S-4 27-126
(27, PART 6)
B. If a new principal nonresidential building is constructed on a lot, then any
existing parking on such lot that serves such building shall be reconfigured to
comply with this Chapter, including but not limited to, requirements for
channelization of traffic from adjacent streets, channelization of traffic within
the lot, minimum aisle widths, paving and landscaping.
3. Change in Use or Expansion. A structure or use in existence at the effective date of this
Chapter that expands or changes in use of an existing principal building shall be
required to provide all of the required parking for the entire size and type of the
resulting use, except as follows:
2019 S-4 27-126.1
(27, PART 6)
A. If a nonresidential use expands by an aggregate total maximum of 5% in the
applicable measurement (such as building floor area) beyond what existed at
the time of adoption of this Chapter, then no additional parking is required.
For example, if an existing building included 3,000 square feet, and a single
minor addition of 150 square feet was proposed, then additional parking would
not be required. This addition without providing new parking shall only be
allowed one time per lot.
4. Continuing Obligation of Parking and Loading Spaces. All required numbers of
parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be available as long as the use
or building which the spaces serve still exist, and such spaces shall not be reduced
in number below the minimum required by this Chapter. No required parking area
or off-street loading spaces shall be used for any other use (such as storage or
display of materials) that interferes with the area’s availability for parking.
5. Location of Parking.
A. Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot or abutting lot with
the principal use served, unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Hearing Board that a method of providing the spaces is guaranteed to
be available during all of the years the use is in operation within 300 feet
walking distance from the entrance of the principal use being served. A written
and signed lease shall be provided, if applicable. A sign shall direct persons to
the parking spaces.
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board may require that the use be approved for
period of time consistent with the lease of the parking, and that a renewal
of the permit shall only be approved if the parking lease is renewed.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §602)
§27-603. Design Standards for Off-Street Parking.
1. General Requirements.
A. Backing onto a Street. No parking area shall be designed to require or
encourage parked vehicles to back into a public street in order to leave a
parking space, except for a driveway that enters onto a local street or parking
court. Parking spaces may back onto an alley.
B. Every required parking space shall be designed so that each motor vehicle may
proceed to and from the parking space provided for it without requiring the
moving of any other vehicle, unless specifically permitted otherwise.
C. Parking areas shall not be within a required buffer yard or street right-of-way.
D. Separation from Street. Except for parking spaces immediately in front of
individual dwellings, all areas for off-street parking, off-street loading and
12/17/2012 27-127
ZONING
unloading and the storage or movement of motor vehicles shall be physically
separated from the street by a continuous grass or landscaped planting strip,
except for necessary and approved vehicle entrances and exits to the lot.
E. Stacking and Obstructions. Each lot shall provide adequate area upon the lot
to prevent back-up of vehicles on a public street while awaiting entry to the lot,
or while waiting for service at a drive-through facility.

(27, PART 6)
B. Drainage. Adequate provisions shall be made to maintain uninterrupted
parallel drainage along a public street at the point of driveway entry. The
Borough may require an applicant to install an appropriate type and size of
pipe at a driveway crossing.
5. Paving, Grading and Drainage.
A. Parking and loading facilities and including driveways shall be graded and
adequately drained to prevent erosion or excessive water flow across streets or
adjoining properties.
B. Except for landscaped areas, all portions of required parking areas for
commercial, industrial, multi-family and institutional uses involving four or
more spaces, off-street loading facilities and driveways serving such uses shall
be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, paving block, or other low-dust materials
pre-approved by the Borough. Driveways limited to use by emergency vehicles
are not required to be paved provided the fire company approves the proposed
surface. Driveways and parking that serve public uses, public recreation areas
and other types of dwellings are not required to be paved.
(1) However, by special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may allow
parking areas with low or seasonal usage to be maintained in stone, grass
or other suitable surfaces. For example, the Board may allow parking
spaces to be grass, while major aisles are covered by stone.
(2) If the design and materials are found to be acceptable in writing by the
Borough Engineer, portions of parking areas may be covered with a lowdust
porous parking surface that is designed to promote groundwater
recharge. This might include porous asphalt or pervious concrete placed
over open graded gravel and crushed stone. Porous parking surfaces shall
not be allowed in areas routinely used by heavy trucks.
6. Lighting of Parking Areas. See “Light and Glare Control” in Part 5.

8. Paved Area Setbacks (including off-street parking setbacks).
A. Intent. To ensure that parked or moving vehicles within a lot do not obstruct
sight distance or interfere with pedestrian traffic, to aid in stormwater
management along streets and to prevent vehicles from entering or exiting a
lot other than at approved driveways.
B. Any new or expanded vehicle parking or vehicle storage area serving a
principal nonresidential use shall be separated from a public street by a
planting strip. The planting strip shall have a minimum width of 10 feet and
be maintained in grass or other attractive vegetative groundcover. The
planting strip may be on one or both sides of any sidewalk, provided the
planting width totals 10 feet. This 10-foot width shall be increased to 20 feet
for a lot including 20 or more parking spaces that are visible from the street.
(1) The planting strip shall not include heights or locations of plants that
would obstruct safe sight distances, but may include deciduous trees that
allow motorists to maintain views under the leaf canopy.
(2) The planting strip may be placed inward from the shoulder of an uncurbed
street or inward from the curb of a curbed street. The planting strip may
27-130 12/17/2012

overlap the street right-of-way, provided it does not conflict with PennDOT
requirements, and provided that the Borough and PennDOT as applicable
maintain the right to replace planting areas within the right-of-way with
future street improvements.
(3) Approximately perpendicular driveway crossings may be placed within the
planting strip. Mostly vegetative stormwater channels may be placed
within the planting strip.
(4) The following shall be prohibited within the planting strip:
(a) Paving, except as allowed by Subsection (3) above, and except for
street widenings that may occur after the development is completed.
(b) Fences.
(c) Parking, storage or display of vehicles or manufactured homes or
items for sale or rent or junk.
(5) Where feasible, where a sidewalk is not installed, this setback should
include an unobstructed generally level width running parallel to a street
that is suitable for a person to walk.
C. See landscaping requirements in §§27-803 and 27-804.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §603)
§27-604. Off-Street Loading.
1. Each use shall provide off-street loading facilities, which meet the requirements of
this Section, sufficient to accommodate the maximum demand generated by the use
and the maximum size vehicle, in a manner that will not routinely obstruct traffic
on a public street and traffic entering and exiting the lot. If no other reasonable
alternative is feasible, traffic may be obstructed for occasional loading and
unloading along an alley, provided traffic has the ability to use another method of
access.
2. At the time of review under this Chapter, the applicant shall provide evidence to
the Zoning Officer on whether the use will have sufficient numbers and sizes of
loading facilities. The Planning Commission and/or Borough Council may provide
advice to the Zoning Officer on this matter as part of any plan review by such
boards. For the purposes of this Section, the words “loading” and “unloading” are
used interchangeably.
3. Each space and the needed maneuvering room shall not intrude into approved
buffer areas and landscaped areas.

other local ordinances.
2. Access shall be also provided so that fire equipment can reach all sides of principal
nonresidential buildings and multi-family/apartment buildings. This access shall
be able to support a loaded fire pumper truck, but shall not necessarily be paved.
3. The specific locations of fire lanes and fire equipment access are subject to approval
by the Borough, after review by local fire officials.

3. Portable Signs (Including “Signs on Mobile Stands”) and Other Temporary Signs.
A. Purpose. These standards recognize portable signs as a particular type of sign
that has the characteristics of a temporary sign but that has been
inappropriately used as a permanent sign. This Section is based on the policy
that if a use desires to regularly display a sign for regularly changing
messages, that it erect a permanent sign within all of the requirements of this
Chapter.
B. Portable signs are prohibited in all districts, except as a temporary charitable
event sign permitted by §27-703.
C. Businesses are encouraged to provide an area on a permanent sign that
displays changeable messages, as opposed to using a separate sign for such
purpose.
4. Signs on Freestanding Walls. A freestanding sign may be attached to a decorative
masonry or stone wall with a maximum height of six feet and a maximum length
of 12 feet, without being regulated by the wall setback regulations of this Chapter

§27-706. Off-Premises Signs (Including Billboards).
1. Purposes. Off-premises signs are controlled by this Chapter for the following
purposes, to: ensure that a physical environment is maintained that is attractive
to desirable types of development, especially light industrial and office parks;
prevent visual pollution in the Borough and protect property values, especially in
consideration of the fact that most commercial areas of the Borough are within
close proximity to existing residences; prevent glare on adjacent property and
streets; avoid the creation of additional visual distractions to motorists, especially
along busy arterial streets that involve complex turning movements and numerous
traffic hazards; recognize the numerous alternative forms of free speech available
in the Borough, including existing nonconforming off-premises signs, on-premises
signs and temporary signs and printed and electronic media; carry out the purposes
listed in §27-701.

E. Maximum Height–35 feet above the elevation of the adjacent street, measured
at the street centerline.
F. Attached. No off-premises sign or sign face shall be attached in any way to any
other off-premises sign, except that a sign of 300 square feet may have two sign
faces of 300 square feet each provided the angle between the signs does not
exceed 60 degrees.
G. Control of Lighting and Glare. See standards in §27-507. Lights shall be
directed so they do not shine into the eyes of motorists nor residents of homes.
Lighting shall be directed downwards towards the sign area and shall be

GENERAL REGULATIONS
§27-801. Frontage onto Improved Streets; Number of Uses or Buildings;
Minimum Size of Dwellings.
1. Frontage Required onto Improved Street. Each proposed new lot, each land
development and each proposed principal building shall be on a lot which directly
abuts a public street, a street proposed to be dedicated to the Borough by the
subdivision plan which created or creates such lot, or a private street which meets
all of the requirements of the Borough Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance [Chapter 22]. In the case of townhouses, manufactured/mobile home
park, or apartments, each unit may have access onto a parking court which then
has access onto a public or private street meeting Borough standards.
2. Number of Principal Uses and Principal Buildings per Lot.
A. A lot in a commercial or industrial district may include more than one
permitted principal use per lot and/or more than one permitted principal
building per lot, provided that all of the requirements are met for each use and
each building. If differing dimensional requirements apply for different uses
on the lot, then the most restrictive requirement shall apply.
(1) For example, if use one requires a one acre lot area and use two on the
same lot requires a two-acre lot area, then the lot shall have a minimum
lot area of two acres.
(2) The applicant shall submit a site plan that demonstrates that each
structure would meet the requirements of this Chapter.
(3) The uses and buildings shall be in common ownership. However, a
condominium form of ownership of individual buildings, with a legally
binding property owners association, may be established if the applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, based upon review by the
Borough Solicitor, that there will be appropriate legal mechanisms in
place.
B. A lot within a residential district shall not include more than one principal use
and shall not include more than one principal building unless specifically
permitted by this Chapter.
(1) A manufactured/mobile home park, condominium residential development
or apartment development may include more than one principal building
per lot, provided all other requirements of this Chapter are met. A
condominium form of ownership of individual dwelling units, with a
legally binding homeowners association, may be established if the
applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, based upon
12/17/2012 27-145
ZONING
review by the Borough Solicitor, that there will be appropriate legal
mechanisms in place and compliance with applicable State law.
3. Minimum Size of Dwellings. Each dwelling unit shall include a minimum of 500
square feet of enclosed habitable, indoor, heated floor area, which shall be
primarily above the ground level.
4. Maximum Occupancy. No recreational vehicle shall be occupied on a lot for more
than 30 days in a calendar year, except as may be approved within a campground
with suitable central water and sewage service. No mobile/manufactured home
shall be occupied on a lot as a dwelling unless it meets all of the requirements for
a dwelling.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §801)
§27-802. Height Exceptions.
The maximum structure height specified for each district shall not apply to: antenna
that meet the requirements of this Chapter, water towers, clock or bell towers, steeples
and religious symbols attached to places of worship, electrical transmission lines,
elevator shafts, wind turbines that comply with this Chapter, skylights, chimneys,
heating/ventilation/air conditional equipment, industrial mechanical equipment areas

§27-803. Special Lot and Yard Requirements, Sight Distance and Buffer
Yards.
1. In General.
A. No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in such a way that it
would result in another lot, building or use not being able to meet the
requirements of this Chapter. This includes, but is not limited to: setback
areas, non-impervious areas and off-street parking areas.
B. Emergency Access. All uses and structures shall have adequate provisions for
access by emergency vehicles and fire ladders. Such access shall be maintained
in a passable condition by the owner of the lot, or where applicable by the
property owner association.
2. Exceptions to Minimum Lot Areas, Lot Widths and Yards.
27-146 12/17/2012
(27, PART 8)
A. Corner Lots. For a corner lot, each yard that abuts a public street shall be
considered a front yard and meet the requirements for minimum depth of a
front yard. See definition of “lot, corner” in §27-202.
B. Projections into Required Yards.
(1) Cornices, footers, eaves, roof overhangs, sills or other similar architectural
features, exterior stairways, unenclosed fire escapes or other required
means of egress, rain leads, chimneys, “Bilco”-type doors for basement
access, window awnings, chaise for heating pipes or other similar
structures that do not include space usable by persons may extend or
project into a required yard not more than three feet, except as may be
required within a drainage or utility easement.
(2) Steps, stoops, fire escapes, handicapped ramps, and landings necessary to
provide entrance to a building may be located within a required setback
area.
(3) For decks and porches, see §27-307.
C. Lot Widths Around Curves. Around the bulb of a cul-de-sac street or on the
outside of the curve of a street with a radius of less than 150 feet, the
minimum lot width at the minimum building setback line may be reduced to
60% of the width that would otherwise be required.
3. Sight Clearance at Intersections. At the intersection of two streets, a clear sight
triangle shall be provided. Within this triangle, no visual obstructions shall be
allowed between the height of three feet and 10 feet above the ground level, except
for utility posts, mailboxes, single sign posts and the trunks of canopy trees. The
triangle shall be measured along the edge of the travel lane of the streets. Each leg
of the triangle shall be measured 75 feet from the intersection of the edge of the
travel lanes of the streets. A third longer leg shall connect the ends of the two legs
to form the triangle.
A. However, in place of the above sight triangle, where a local street intersects an
arterial street with a stop sign only at the local street, the leg of the triangle
along the arterial street shall be increased to 250 feet and the leg along the
local street shall be decreased to 20 feet.
B. The clear sight triangle shall be kept free of such obstructions in perpetuity.
4. Buffer Yards. Buffer yards including plant screening complying with the following
standards shall be required under the following situations, unless a more
restrictive provision is established by another section of this Chapter:
A. A minimum 10-foot wide buffer yard with plant screening shall be required
along the rear and side lot lines of any lot used principally for principal
nonresidential purposes that is contiguous to a lot line of a residentially zoned
lot occupied by an existing principal dwelling.
12/17/2012 27-147
ZONING
(1) If a principal business use will include areas used for manufacturing or
will have a loading dock that will be routinely serviced by two or more
tractor-trailer trucks or refrigerated trucks, then the minimum buffer yard
width along such manufacturing area and/or loading dock shall be
increased to 50 feet, and the minimum initial height of plantings shall be
increased to six feet.
(2) The presence of a dwelling on the same lot as a principal business use
shall not by itself require the provision of a buffer yard.
(3) An 10-foot wide minimum buffer yard with landscaped screening shall be
required where a subdivision or land development of new dwellings will
have rear yards abutting a public street.
(4) A buffer yard is also required to be provided by the following if they are
abutting and visible from a public street:
(a) Along lot lines and street rights-of-way of any newly developed or
expanded outdoor industrial storage or loading area.
(b) Along lot lines and street rights-of-way of any newly developed or
expanded area routinely used for the overnight parking of two or more
tractor-trailer trucks or trailers of tractor-trailers.
B. A required yard may overlap a required buffer yard, provided the requirement
for each is met. The buffer yard shall be measured from the district boundary
line, street right-of-way line or lot line, whichever is applicable. Required
plantings shall not be placed within the right-of-way, except that the Borough
may allow deciduous canopy trees.
C. The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures, dumpsters,
commercial or industrial storage or display, signs, manufacturing or processing
activity, materials, loading and unloading areas or vehicle parking or display.
D. Fence. The Borough may require the installation of a mostly solid decorative
fence in addition to the plantings. Any wall or fence in a buffer yard shall be
placed on the inside (nonresidential side) of any required plant screening. If a
fence in a buffer yard has one side that is more finished or smoother than the
other side, the more finished or smoother side shall face the outside of the
buffer yard.
E. Each planting screen shall meet the following requirements:
(1) Plant materials needed to form the visual screen shall have a minimum
height when planted of four feet. In addition, an average of one deciduous
shade tree, with a minimum trunk diameter of two inches measured six
inches above the finished ground level, shall be placed for each 50 feet of
length of the buffer yard. The shade trees may be clustered or spaced
unevenly.
27-148 12/17/2012
(27, PART 8)
(2) Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be of such species, spacing
and size as can reasonably be expected to produce within three years a
mostly solid year-round visual screen at least six feet in height.
(3) The plant screen shall be placed so that at maturity the plants will not
obstruct a street or sidewalk.
(4) The plant visual screen shall extend the full length of the lot line, except
for: (a) Borough-approved points of approximately perpendicular vehicle
or pedestrian ingress and egress to the lot, (b) locations necessary to
comply with safe sight distance requirements where the plantings cannot
feasibly be moved further back, and (c) locations needed to meet other
specific State, Borough and utility requirements, such as stormwater
swales.
(5) Weak-stem plants shall not be used to meet the buffer yard requirements.
A monotonous straight row of the same species is discouraged. A more
naturalistic form of planting is encouraged with a mix of species. If more
than 20 evergreen plants are proposed, no more than 50% shall be of one
species.
(6) Evergreen trees should be planted at diagonal off-sets so that there is
room for future growth of the trees.
(7) The plant screening shall primarily use evergreen trees.
(8) The Zoning Officer may also modify the buffer yard requirements if
necessary for fire safety reasons. The Zoning Hearing Board may by
special exception reduce the width of the buffer yard if the required width
is not feasible.
F. Buffer Yard Plans.
(1) Prior to the issuance of a permit under this Chapter where a buffer yard
would be required, and on any required subdivision or land development
plan, the applicant shall submit plans showing:
(a) The location and arrangement of each buffer yard.
(b) The placement, general selection of species and initial size of all plant
materials.
(c) The placement, size, materials and type of all fences to be placed in
such buffer yard.

nonconformity from the Zoning Officer after providing sufficient evidence.
2. Continuation of Nonconformities.
A. A lawful nonconforming use, structure or lot as defined by this Chapter may
be continued and may be sold and continued by new owners.
B. Any expansion of, construction upon or change in use of a nonconformity shall
only occur in conformance with this Section.
C. If an existing use was not lawfully established, it shall not have any right to
continue as a nonconforming use.
3. Expansion of or Construction Upon Nonconformities. The following shall apply,
unless the structure is approved under Subsection .4.
A. Nonconforming Structure.
(1) The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to be
reconstructed or expanded provided:
(a) That such action will not increase the severity or amount of the
nonconformity (such as the area of the building extending into the
required yard) or create any new nonconformity.
(b) That any expanded area will comply with the applicable setbacks in
that district and other requirements of this Chapter, except as may be
allowed under Subsection .A(3) below.
(2) In the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a nonconforming
use, any expansion shall also meet the requirements of this Section
regarding nonconforming uses.
(3) As a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may approve a reduction
of up to 50% in a side or rear setback for an existing dwelling if the
27-152 12/17/2012
(27, PART 8)
applicant proves such setback is necessary to allow a customary addition
of such dwelling or a replacement of an existing undersized dwelling with
a new dwelling. This Subsection shall not allow a reduction in setback to
increase the number of dwelling units on the lot, except for a unit for care
of relative.
B. Nonconforming Lots.
(1) Permitted Construction on a Nonconforming Lot. A single permitted by
right principal use and its customary accessory uses may be constructed,
reconstructed or expanded on a nonconforming lot provided all of the
following additional requirements are met:
(a) The lot must be a lawful nonconforming lot of record.
(b) Minimum setback requirements shall be met.
(c) State and Federal wetland regulations shall be met.
(d) If a septic or well is used, the requirements for such shall be met.
(2) Lot Width. The fact that an existing lawful lot of record does not meet the
minimum lot width requirements of this Chapter shall not by itself cause
such lot to be considered to be a nonconforming lot.
C. Expansion of a Nonconforming Nonresidential Use. A nonconforming use or a
building used by a nonconforming use shall not be expanded, except in
accordance with the following provisions:
(1) An expansion of more than 5% in total building floor area shall require
special exception approval from the Zoning Hearing Board under Part 1.
(2) Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same lot that the
nonconforming use was located upon at the time the use became
nonconforming.
(3) The (a) total building floor area used by a nonconforming use or the (b)
total land area covered by the nonconforming use, whichever is more
restrictive, shall not be increased by greater than 50% beyond what
existed in the nonconforming use at the time the use first became
nonconforming.
(a) The above maximum increase shall be measured in aggregate over the
entire life of the nonconformity. All expansions of the nonconforming
use and/or building(s) that occurred since the use originally became
nonconforming shall count towards the above maximum increase.
12/17/2012 27-153
ZONING
(4) Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required setbacks
and other requirements of this Chapter, unless the Zoning Hearing Board
grants a variance.
D. Expansion of a Nonconforming Residential Use. An existing nonconforming
residential use may be expanded as a permitted by right use provided that: (1)
the number of dwelling units or rooming house units are not increased, (2) the
expansion meets all applicable setbacks, (3) no new types of nonconformities
are created and (4) a nonconformity is not made more severe.
E. Nonconforming Sign. The provisions of this Chapter shall not provide a right
to expand or extend a nonconforming sign. Instead, any expansions or
extensions of a nonconforming sign shall comply with this Chapter. See also
§27-707.
4. Damaged or Destroyed Nonconformities. A nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use that has been destroyed or damaged may be rebuilt in a
nonconforming fashion only if: (A) the application for a building permit is
submitted within 18 months after the date of damage or destruction, (B) work
begins in earnest within 12 months afterward the building permit is issued and
continues, and (C) no nonconformity may be newly created or increased by any
reconstruction. The property shall be properly secured during such time in such a
way to keep out trespassers and to avoid harm to neighboring properties.
5. Abandonment of a Nonconformity.
A. If a nonconforming use of a building or land is discontinued, razed, removed
or abandoned for 12 or more months, subsequent use of such building or land
shall conform with the regulations of the district in which it is located, except:
(1) As provided for in the “damaged or destroyed nonconformities” provisions
of this Section in Subsection .4.
B. The applicant shall be responsible to provide clear and convincing evidence
that the nonconformity was not abandoned.

A. Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land shall not revert to a
nonconforming use.
B. A nonconforming use may be changed to a different nonconforming use only if
approved as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board. However, special
exception approval is not needed for a simple change within an existing
building from one lawful nonconforming retail store use to another retail store
use or from one lawful nonconforming personal service use to another personal
27-154 12/17/2012
(27, PART 8)
service use provided that the new use complies with any Zoning Hearing Board
conditions that applied to the previous use and is not more objectionable in
external effects than the previous use.
C. Where special exception approval is required for a change of a nonconforming
use, the Board shall determine whether the applicant has provided sufficient
proof to show that the proposed new use will be equal or less objectionable in
external effects than the pre-existing nonconforming use with regard to:
(1) Traffic safety and generation (especially truck traffic).
(2) Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire, hazardous
substances, and explosive hazards.
(3) Amount and character of outdoor storage.
(4) Hours of operation if the use would be close to dwellings.
(5) Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
D. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a nonconforming adult use.
7. District Changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become nonconforming because
of a zoning district change shall be regulated under this Section on
nonconformities.

PART 9
AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§27-901. Findings and Purposes.
1. Findings. This Part recognizes that to prevent the creation or establishment of
airport hazards, State law requires every municipality having an airport hazard
area within its municipal borders to adopt, administer and enforce, airport zoning
regulations for such airport hazard area. These regulations divide the area into
zones and, within the zones, regulate the height to which structures may be erected
or objects of natural growth may be allowed to grow.
2. Purposes.
A. To carry out the authority conferred by the PA Airport Zoning Act, in addition
to the authority of the PA Municipalities Planning Code.
B. To recognize that an obstruction along an airport approach has the potential
for endangering lives and property; and that an obstruction may affect
approach minimums of an airport; and that an obstruction may reduce the size
of areas available for the landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft, thus
tending to impair the utility of an airport and the public investment therein.
C. To prevent the creation or extension of obstructions that could be a hazard to
air transportation.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §901)
§27-902. Airport Approach Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this Part:
AIRCRAFT–any contrivance, except an unpowered hang glider or parachute, used
for manned ascent into or flight through the air.
AIRPORT–any other area of land or water which is used, or intended to be used,
for the landing and takeoff of aircraft and any appurtenant areas which are used,
or intended to be used, for airport buildings or air navigation facilities or rights-ofways,
together with all airport buildings and facilities thereon. As used herein, the
term “airport” includes public airports but excludes private airports and heliports.
Public and private airports are defined separately in this Section.
AIRPORT ELEVATION–the highest point of an airport’s usable landing area
measured in feet above sea level. The elevation of the Lehigh Valley International
Airport is 394 feet.
12/17/2012 27-157
ZONING
AIRPORT HAZARD–any structure or object, natural or man-made, or use of land

(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §902)
§27-903. Overlay District.
The areas shown as “Part 77 Surfaces” on the Airport Surface Areas Map shall serve
as component parts of the Airport Overlay Zoning District. The Airport Overlay Zoning
District shall serve as an overlay to all of the applicable underlying zoning districts. The
Airport Overlay District regulations shall apply in addition to the underlying district
regulations. If the overlay and underlying district regulations conflict regarding the
same matter, the regulation that is most restrictive upon use, height and development
shall apply. A version of the Airport Surfaces Map provided by the State Bureau of
Aviation is attached. Applicants are encouraged to consult any more detailed version
(such as one showing contours or at a larger scale) that may be available from the
Airport Authority.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §903)
§27-904. Airport Surface Zones.
There are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land
lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and
conical surfaces as they apply to an airport. Such zones are shown on the Airport
Surface Areas Map prepared under the direction of the PA. Bureau of Aviation, which
is incorporated herein by reference and thereby made a part hereof. An area located in
more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined on
the Airport Surface Areas Map, which may also be known as the Airport Approach
Zoning Map.
A. Utility Runway Visual Approach Surface Zone. The zone is established beneath
the visual approach surface. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides
with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The approach zone
expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance
5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the
centerline of the runaway. The height limitation of this zone slopes 20 feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
B. Transitional Surface Zones. The transitional zones are established beneath the
transitional surfaces adjacent to each runway and approach surface as
27-160 12/17/2012
(27, PART 9)
indicated on the Airport Surface Areas Map. See definition of “transitional
surfaces” above.
C. Horizontal Surface Zone. The horizontal zone is established beneath the
horizontal surface, 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the
perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii from the
center of each end of the primary surface of each runway designated as utility
or visual or 10,000 feet radii for all other runways, from the center of each end
of the primary surface. The horizontal zone does not include the approach
surface and transitional surface zones. The height restrictions of this zone are
established at 150 feet above the established airport elevation.
D. Conical Surface Zone. The conical zone is established beneath the conical
surface. This zone commences at the periphery of the horizontal surface and
extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The height
limitations of this zone shall slope 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface and at 150 feet above the
established airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the
established airport elevation.
E. Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Surface Zone shall be
established beneath the nonprecision instrument approach surface. The inner
edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500
feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the
continuation of the centerline of the runway. The height limitation of this zone
slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance
of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §904)
§27-905. Airport Surface Zone Height Limitations.
Except as otherwise provided in this Part, no structure shall be erected, altered, or
maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this Part to a
height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such
applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question
according to the Airport Surface Zones Map, as described above.
A. Forty Feet Height Exception. Nothing in this Part shall be construed as
prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure or tree to a height
up to 40 feet above the surface of the land.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §905)
§27-906. Airport Zoning Requirements.
12/17/2012 27-161
ZONING
1. Activities That Conflict with Aircraft Operations. No use shall be allowed in any
airport approach zone that would: create electrical interference with navigational
signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult
for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the
eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create
high risk bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
A. The burden of proof shall be upon the Airport Manager or designee or State
Bureau of Aviation to provide evidence to the Zoning Officer that such a
condition exists. It is not the responsibility of the Borough to independently
identify such hazards.
2. Nonconforming Uses.
A. Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this Part shall not
be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of
any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date
of this Part, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming
use, except as provided in §27-907 (relating to permits and variances). Nothing
contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was
begun prior to the effective date of this Part, and is diligently executed.
B. Marking and Lighting. In response to a specific written request from the
Airport Authority staff that documents the need and the applicable part of
these regulations, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree
may be required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance
thereon or nearby of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by
the zoning officer to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such airport obstruction.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §906)
§27-907. Airport Approach Permits and Variances.
1. Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in Subsections A, B and C hereunder,
no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected
or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted that would intrude into any
zone created by this Part unless a zoning permit therefore shall have been applied
for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired, with sufficient information to permit a determination of
whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. If a determination is made that the proposal complies with this
Part as well as other applicable Borough regulations, the permit shall be granted.
No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall be granted
unless a variance has been approved in accordance with Subsection .4.
27-162 12/17/2012
(27, PART 9)
A. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical
height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or
topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such zones.
B. In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal
distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit
shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed
for such approach zones.
C. In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the
perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic feature,
would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
D. A permit is not required under this Part to maintain, repair or replace parts
of existing structures which do not result in any increase in the intrusion into
an airport approach zone.
E. Airport and State Review. When a permit is requested for a use or structure
that may intrude into the airport approach zones, the applicant shall be
required to provide written notice of such application to the Airport Manager
and the State Bureau of Aviation. As of 2011, such State review shall be
accomplished by completing and submitting PennDOT Form AV-57, or its
successor. No permit shall be issued unless a favorable review is provided by
such entities or unless a minimum of 30 days has passed from the date such
notice was received by such entities. The Zoning Officer is not obligated to
issue a permit within 30 days, and may delay issuance while awaiting further
evidence of compliance. The Zoning Officer shall rely upon any written
determination by State Bureau of Aviation and/or other qualified credible
professionals regarding whether there is compliance or not with the airport
approach zoning regulations.
2. Existing Uses. Before any nonconforming structure that intrudes into the airport
approach zones may be replaced, extended or rebuilt, a permit must be secured
from the zoning officer. Such nonconforming structure or object shall not be allowed
to extend into the airport approach zone by a greater extent than previously
lawfully existed, unless a variance is approved.
3. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Unstable. If the Zoning Officer is made aware
that an existing structure that intrudes into the airport approach zones has become
abandoned or that a tree that intrudes into the airport approach zones has died or
become unstable, the Zoning Officer may require its removal by the owner of the
property.
12/17/2012 27-163
ZONING
4. Variance. Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of any
structure or permit the growth of any object of natural growth or otherwise use his
property in violation of airport zoning regulations may apply for a variance from
the zoning regulations in question pursuant to Part 1. A variance shall only be
granted after the requirements of §27-111.4 are satisfied, in addition to the
following standards:
A. Any variance may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions that the
Zoning Hearing Board may deem necessary to serve the purposes of this Part
and this Chapter. These conditions should include any reasonable mitigation
measures recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration, Bureau of
Aviation or the Airport Operator.
B. The Zoning Hearing Board shall notify the State Bureau of Aviation in writing
of any decision to approve a variance to this Part. This notice shall be sent
within 10 days after the decision.
C. Prior to submittal to the Borough, the applicant for a variance to this Part
shall submit a written notice of such application to the Federal Aviation
Administration, the State Bureau of Aviation and the Airport Manager (or
equivalent position). The Zoning Hearing Board shall consider any written
comments provided from such entities. As of 2011, the FAA required that the
applicant submit FAA Form 7460 or its successor form. The Zoning Hearing
Board shall not vote to approve the variance application unless a minimum of
30 days has passed after such submittals were received by such entities. The
Zoning Hearing Board is not obligated to vote upon a variance after such 30
days, but instead shall make a decision within the timing allowed by the
Municipalities Planning Code.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board in no case shall approve a variance where the
Federal Aviation Administration and/or the Bureau of Aviation provide a
written finding that the proposed structure would result in increased hazards
to air travel.
5. Hazard Marking and Lighting. In granting any permit or variance under this
Section, the Zoning Hearing Board may, as it deems advisable and reasonable
under the circumstances, condition the approval or variance upon the owner of the
structure or object in question installing, operating and maintaining such markers
and lights as are consistent with guidelines or regulations adopted by the FAA.
Such markers and lights shall be funded by the owner of such structure or object,
unless specifically agreed upon otherwise.
(Ord. 800, 3/13/2012, §907)
§27-908. Zoning Hearing Board Authority Regarding Airport Approaches.
The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the following additional authority: (A) to hear and
decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the
27-164 12/17/2012
(27, PART 9)
zoning officer in the enforcement of this Part; (B) to hear and decide any special
exception approval authorized by the terms of this Part; and (C) to hear and decide
specific variance requests to this Part.
