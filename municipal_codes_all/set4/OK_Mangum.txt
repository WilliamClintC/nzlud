D. Cleaning And Mowing Procedures: The Board of Commissioners, or appointed
administrative officer,  may cause property within the City limits to be
cleaned of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or mowed in accordance with the
following procedure:
1. Notice To Clean Or Mow:
a. At least ten (10) days' notice shall be given to the owner of the property
by mail at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the County
Treasurer's Office before the Board of Commissioners holds a hearing or takes
action. The notice shall order the property owner to clean the property of
trash or to cut or mow the weeds or grass on the property, as appropriate, and
the notice shall further state that unless the work is performed within ten
(10) days of the date of the notice, the work shall be done by the City and a
notice of lien shall be filed with the County Clerk against property for the
costs due and owing the City. At the time of mailing of notice to the property
owner, the City shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service,
which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of
the mailee.
b. If the property owner cannot be located within ten (10) days from the date
of mailing by the City Board of Commissioners, notice may be given by posting a
copy of the notice on the property or by publication, as defined in 11 Oklahoma
Statutes section 1-102, one time not less than ten (10) days prior to any
hearing or action by the City. If the Board of Commissioners anticipates
summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with the provisions of subsection
C of this section, the notice, whether by certified mail, posting or
publication, shall state that any accumulations of trash or excessive weed or
grass growth on the owner's property occurring within six (6) months after the
removal of trash or cutting or mowing of weeds or grass on the property
pursuant to notice may be summarily abated by the Board of Commissioners, that
the costs of the abatement shall be assessed against the owner and that a lien
may be imposed on the property to secure the payment, all without further prior
notice to the property owner.
2. Consent Given For City To Clean And Mow: The owner of the property may give
his written consent to the City authorizing the removal of the trash or the
mowing of the weeds or grass. By giving written consent, the owner waives his
right to a hearing by the City.
3. Hearing Regarding Abatement Requirement: A hearing may be held by the Board
of Commissioners to determine whether the accumulation of trash or the growth
of weeds or grass has caused the property to become detrimental to the health,
benefit and welfare of the public and the community or a hazard to traffic, or
creates a fire hazard to the danger of property.
4. Entry Powers Of City To Clean Or Mow; Notice Of Lien: Upon a finding that
the condition of the property constitutes a detriment or hazard, and that the
property would be benefited by the removal of conditions, the agents of the
City are granted the right of entry on the property for the removal of trash,
mowing of weeds or grass and performance of the necessary duties as a
governmental function of the City. Immediately following the cleaning or mowing
of the property, the City Clerk shall file a notice of lien with the County
Clerk describing the property and the work performed by the City, and stating
that the City claims a lien on the property for the cleaning or mowing costs.
5. Costs; Lien Provisions:
a. The Board of Commissioners shall determine the actual cost of cleaning and
mowing and any other expenses that may be necessary in connection therewith,
including the cost of notice and mailing. The City Clerk shall forward by mail
to the property owner specified in subsection B1 of this section a statement of
actual cost and demanding payment. If the cleaning and mowing are done by the
City, the cost to the property owner for the cleaning and mowing shall not
exceed the actual cost of the labor, maintenance and equipment required. If the
cleaning and mowing are done on a private contract basis, the contract shall be
awarded to the lowest and best bidder.
b. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing
of the statement, the City Clerk shall forward a certified statement of the
amount of the cost to the County Treasurer, and the same shall be levied on the
property and collected by the County Treasurer as other taxes authorized by
law. Until fully paid, the cost and the interest thereon shall be the personal
obligation of the property owner for and after the date the cost is certified
to the County Treasurer.
c. In addition, the cost and the interest thereon shall be a lien against the
property from the date the cost is certified to the County Treasurer, coequal
with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special assessments
and prior and superior to all other titles and liens against the property, and
the lien shall continue until the cost shall be fully paid. At the time of
collection, the County Treasurer shall collect a fee of five dollars ($5.00)
for each parcel of property. The fee shall be deposited to the credit of the
General Fund of the County.
d. At any time prior to the collection as provided in this subsection B5, the
City may pursue any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and
interest thereon including an action in personam against the property owner and
an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral
interest, if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the surface
owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to
this section. Upon receiving payment, if any, the City Clerk shall forward to
the County Treasurer a notice of payment and directing discharge of the lien.
(2002 Code § 96.03; amd. 2018 Code)
 
E. Reoccurrence Of Nuisance: If the Board of Commissioners causes property
within the City limits to be cleaned of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or
mowed in accordance with the procedures provided in subsection B of this
section, any subsequent accumulations of trash or excessive weed or grass
growth on the property occurring within a six (6) month period may be declared
to be a nuisance and may be summarily abated without further prior notice to
the property owner. At the time of each summary abatement, the City shall
notify the property owner of the abatement and the costs thereof. The notice
shall state that the property owner may request a hearing within ten (10) days
after the date of mailing the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as
provided in subsection B of this section. Unless otherwise determined at the
hearing, the cost of abatement shall be determined and collected as provided in
subsection B5 of this section. Provided, however, that this subsection shall
not apply if the records of the County Clerk show that the property was
transferred after notice was given pursuant to subsection B of this section.
 
F. Exemptions: The provisions of this section shall not apply to any property
zoned and used for agricultural purposes. (2002 Code § 96.04; amd. 2018 Code)
§ 2.   An emergency is declared to exist; therefore, this Ordinance is
effective immediately.
 
§ 3.   That if any court with proper jurisdiction, or any act by any
legislature, makes any provision of this Ordinance invalid, the remainder of
such ordinance will remain in full force and effect.
 
§ 4.   That all ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with this
ordinance are repealed.

product or vapor product on behalf of any such person. Provided, however, that
it shall not be unlawful for an employee under eighteen (18) years of age to
handle any tobacco, tobacco product or vapor product when required in the
performance of the employee's duties.
 
A person engaged in the sale or distribution of tobacco, tobacco product or
vapor product shall demand proof of age from a prospective purchaser or
recipient if an ordinary person would conclude on the basis of appearance that
the prospective purchaser might be less than eighteen (18) years of age.
 
If an individual engaged in the sale or distribution of tobacco, tobacco
product or vapor product has demanded proof of age from a prospective purchaser
or recipient who is not less than eighteen (18) years of age, the failure to
subsequently require proof of age shall not constitute a violation of
subsection B of this section.
 
When a person violates subsection 1 or 2 of this section, he or she shall be
guilty of an offense and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine as
follows: Not more than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for the first offense. 
Not more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) for the second offense within a

the period of time prescribed by the ABLE Commission.
 
Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown, and reasonably relied upon proof
of age shall be a defense to any action brought pursuant to this section. A
person cited for violating this section shall be deemed to have reasonably
relied upon proof of age, and such person shall not be found guilty of such
violation, if such person proves that:
 
   The individual, who purchased or received the tobacco, tobacco product or
vapor product, presented a driver license or other government-issued photo
identification purporting to establish that such individual was eighteen (18)
years of age or older, and,
   The person cited for the violation confirmed the validity of the driver
license or other government-issued photo identification presented by such
individual by performing a transaction scan by means of a transaction scan
device.
 
Provided, that this defense shall not relieve from liability any person cited
for a violation of this section if such person failed to exercise reasonable
diligence to determine whether the physical description and picture appearing
on the driver license or other government-issued photo identification was that
of the individual who presented it.  The availability of the defense described
in this subsection does not affect the availability of any other defense under
any other provision of law.
 
If the sale is made by an employee of the owner of a store at which tobacco,
tobacco product or vapor product are sold at retail, the employee shall be
guilty of the violation and shall be subject to the fine.  Each violation by
any employee of an owner of a store licensed to sell tobacco products shall be
deemed a violation against the owner for purposes of a license suspension
pursuant to subsection C of this section.  An owner of a store licensed to sell
tobacco products shall not be deemed in violation of this section for any acts
constituting a violation by any person, when the violation occurs prior to
actual employment of the person by the store owner or the violation occurs at a
location other than the owner's retail store.  For purposes of determining the
liability of a person controlling franchises or business operations in multiple
locations, for any violations of subsection A or B of this section, each
individual franchise or business location shall be deemed a separate entity.
 
Upon failure of the employee to pay the fine within ninety (90) days of the day
of the assessment of such fine, the Municipal Court clerk shall notify the
Department of Public Safety and the Department will, pursuant to State law,
suspend or not issue a driver's license to the employee until proof of payment

own, for the purpose of purchasing or receiving any tobacco, tobacco product or

of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or mowed in accordance with the following
procedure:
   1.    Notice To Clean Or Mow:
      a.    At least ten (10) days' notice shall be given to the owner of the
property by mail at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the
County Treasurer's Office before the Board of Commissioners holds a hearing or
takes action. The notice shall order the property owner to clean the property
of trash or to cut or mow the weeds or grass on the property, as appropriate,
and the notice shall further state that unless the work is performed within ten
(10) days of the date of the notice, the work shall be done by the City and a
notice of lien shall be filed with the County Clerk against property for the
costs due and owing the City. At the time of mailing of notice to the property
owner, the City shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service,
which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of
the mailee.
      b.    If the property owner cannot be located within ten (10) days from
the date of mailing by the City Board of Commissioners, notice may be given by
posting a copy of the notice on the property or by publication, as defined in
11 Oklahoma Statutes section 1-102, one time not less than ten (10) days prior
to any hearing or action by the City. If the Board of Commissioners anticipates
summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with the provisions of subsection
C of this section, the notice, whether by certified mail, posting or
publication, shall state that any accumulations of trash or excessive weed or
grass growth on the owner's property occurring within six (6) months after the
removal of trash or cutting or mowing of weeds or grass on the property
pursuant to notice may be summarily abated by the Board of Commissioners, that
the costs of the abatement shall be assessed against the owner and that a lien
may be imposed on the property to secure the payment, all without further prior
notice to the property owner.
   2.    Consent Given For City To Clean And Mow: The owner of the property may
give his written consent to the City authorizing the removal of the trash or
the mowing of the weeds or grass. By giving written consent, the owner waives
his right to a hearing by the City.
   3.    Hearing Regarding Abatement Requirement: A hearing may be held by the
Board of Commissioners to determine whether the accumulation of trash or the
growth of weeds or grass has caused the property to become detrimental to the
health, benefit and welfare of the public and the community or a hazard to
traffic, or creates a fire hazard to the danger of property.
   4.    Entry Powers Of City To Clean Or Mow; Notice Of Lien: Upon a finding
that the condition of the property constitutes a detriment or hazard, and that
the property would be benefited by the removal of conditions, the agents of the
City are granted the right of entry on the property for the removal of trash,
mowing of weeds or grass and performance of the necessary duties as a
governmental function of the City. Immediately following the cleaning or mowing
of the property, the City Clerk shall file a notice of lien with the County
Clerk describing the property and the work performed by the City, and stating
that the City claims a lien on the property for the cleaning or mowing costs.
   5.   Costs; Lien Provisions:
      a.   The Board of Commissioners shall determine the actual cost of
cleaning and mowing and any other expenses that may be necessary in connection
therewith, including the cost of notice and mailing. The City Clerk shall
forward by mail to the property owner specified in subsection B1 of this
section a statement of actual cost and demanding payment. If the cleaning and
mowing are done by the City, the cost to the property owner for the cleaning
and mowing shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, maintenance and
equipment required. If the cleaning and mowing are done on a private contract
basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder.
      b.   If payment is not made within thirty (30) days from the date of the
mailing of the statement, the City Clerk shall forward a certified statement of
the amount of the cost to the County Treasurer, and the same shall be levied on
the property and collected by the County Treasurer as other taxes authorized by
law. Until fully paid, the cost and the interest thereon shall be the personal
obligation of the property owner for and after the date the cost is certified
to the County Treasurer.
      c.   In addition, the cost and the interest thereon shall be a lien
against the property from the date the cost is certified to the County
Treasurer, coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and
special assessments and prior and superior to all other titles and liens
against the property, and the lien shall continue until the cost shall be fully
paid. At the time of collection, the County Treasurer shall collect a fee of
five dollars ($5.00) for each parcel of property. The fee shall be deposited to
the credit of the General Fund of the County.
      d.   At any time prior to the collection as provided in this subsection
B5, the City may pursue any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and
interest thereon including an action in personam against the property owner and
an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral
interest, if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the surface
owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to
this section. Upon receiving payment, if any, the City Clerk shall forward to
the County Treasurer a notice of payment and directing discharge of the lien.
(2002 Code § 96.03; amd. 2018 Code)
E.   Reoccurrence Of Nuisance: If the Board of Commissioners causes property
within the City limits to be cleaned of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or
mowed in accordance with the procedures provided in subsection B of this
section, any subsequent accumulations of trash or excessive weed or grass
growth on the property occurring within a six (6) month period may be declared
to be a nuisance and may be summarily abated without further prior notice to
the property owner. At the time of each summary abatement, the City shall
notify the property owner of the abatement and the costs thereof. The notice
shall state that the property owner may request a hearing within ten (10) days
after the date of mailing the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as
provided in subsection B of this section. Unless otherwise determined at the
hearing, the cost of abatement shall be determined and collected as provided in
subsection B5 of this section. Provided, however, that this subsection shall
not apply if the records of the County Clerk show that the property was
transferred after notice was given pursuant to subsection B of this section.

business, entertainment or other lawful purpose. A public place shall include,
but not be limited to, any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley,
cafe, theater, drugstore, pool room, shopping center and any other place
devoted to amusement or entertainment of the general public. The term shall
also include the front or immediate area of the above.
   REMAIN: To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets
including the congregating of groups or of interacting minors totaling four (4)
or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for
ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home.
   STREET: A way or place open to the use of the public as a matter of right
for purposes of vehicular travel or, in the case of a sidewalk, for pedestrian
travel. Street includes the legal right-of-way including, but not limited to,

Standard Time or Central Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour
by the public.
   YEAR OF AGE: Continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth to (but
not including the day of) the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making it
clear that seventeen (17) or fewer years of age is herein treated as equivalent
to the phrase "under eighteen (18) years of age". (2002 Code § 131.21)
C.   Age And Hour Restrictions: It shall be unlawful for any person seventeen
(17) or fewer years of age, under eighteen (18), to be or remain at any public
place within the City at night during the period ending at six o'clock (6:00)

   1.   At eleven o'clock (11:00) P.M. for minors fifteen (15) years of age or

during the hours for which subsection C of this section is intended to provide
the maximum limits of regulation shall not be considered in violation of this
section: (2002 Code § 131.23; amd. 2018 Code)
   1.   When accompanied by a parent of the minor.
   2.   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of the minor to
take the parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
   3.   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly. The minor shall evidence the bona fides of the exercise by
possession of a written communication, signed by the minor and countersigned by
a parent of the minor, and with their home address and telephone number,
specifying when and where and in what manner the minor will be on the streets
at night during hours when this section's provisions are otherwise applicable
to the minor in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in the
communication.
   4.   In case of reasonable necessity, but only if the minor has in the
minor's possession a written communication signed by the minor, countersigned
by a parent of the minor evidencing the home address and telephone number, and
establishing reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated
time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination.
   5.   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where the minor resides
or on the sidewalk of either next door neighbor not communicating an objection
to the police officer.
   6.   When returning home, by a direct route from and within thirty (30)
minutes of the termination of a school activity or an activity of a religious
or the voluntary association, provided the minor has a written communication in
the minor's possession, countersigned by the parent, indicating the home
address and telephone number, the purpose for the event, and when, where and in
what manner the minor will be on the streets at night.
   7.   When authorized by regulation issued by the Board of Commissioners, in
other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled, but adapted to
necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on
an individual special permit basis. Normally the regulation by the Board of
Commissioners permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in
advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other
agencies, such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the
use of the streets permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more
than thirty (30) minutes beyond the time for termination of the activity, and
the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is
consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this section.
   8.   When the minor carries a certified card of employment which briefly
identifies the minor and the addresses of his home and his place of employment
and his hours of employment, or carries a valid proof of employment which may
include the latest payroll receipt not over thirty (30) days old.
   9.   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. This clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement
through the City, particularly on normal routes. (2002 Code § 131.23)
E.   Parental Responsibility: It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal
custody of a minor knowingly to permit or, by inefficient control, to allow the
minor to be or remain upon any City street under circumstances not constituting
an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this section. The term
"knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to
have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It
is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a
reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective
test. It shall be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the
activities, conduct or whereabouts of the minor. (2002 Code § 131.24)
F.   Responsibility Of Owners Of Public Places: It shall be unlawful for any
person operating or having charge of any public place to knowingly allow,
permit or suffer the presence of minors in violation of the curfew established
by this section. (2002 Code § 131.26)
G.   Police Procedures:
   1.   A police officer of the City, upon finding or having attention called
to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of this section, normally
shall take the minor to the City police station, or other place designated by
the Chief of Police, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for
the minor, whereupon, they shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to
centralize responsibility in the personnel then on duty for accurate,
effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and recording, thus making
available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access
to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a
birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his best judgment in determining age.
   2.   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the police officer may deliver to
a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a minor
of tender age near home whose identity may readily be ascertained or is known.
   3.   In any event, the police officer shall, within twenty four (24) hours,
file a written report with the Chief of Police or shall participate to the
extent of the information for which he is responsible. The report shall be
treated for purposes of juvenile records in accordance with State Statutes.
   4.   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of the parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails
to take charge of the minor, the minor shall be released to the juvenile
authorities, except to the extent that, in accordance with police regulations,
approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may temporarily be
entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will, on behalf of a
parent, assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the
availability or arrival of a parent. (2002 Code § 131.25)
   5.   In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police shall
personally deliver or, by certified mail, send to a parent written notice of
the violation, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of
applicable penalties. (2002 Code § 131.25; amd. 2018 Code)
H.   Violation; Penalties:
   1.   Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of subsections C
through G of this section more than one time shall be reported to the Juvenile
Court for the treatment, supervision and rehabilitation of the minor.
   2.   A like procedure before the juvenile authorities shall be followed in
any case where the imposing of a fine or fines upon a parent shall not be
effective or where, for any other reason, the provisions of subsections C
through G of this section cannot be made effective by the imposing of penalties
under this subsection H.
   3.   If, after the warning notice pursuant to subsection G5 of this section
of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates subsection E of this section
in connection with a second violation by the minor, this shall be treated as an
offense by the parent. The penalty upon a plea of guilty, nolo contendere or
finding of guilt shall be a fine of up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
up to fifteen (15) days' imprisonment. (2002 Code § 131.99)

work out programs of voluntary compliance and of enforcement. (2002 Code §
93.31; amd. 2018 Code)
6-6-9: ENFORCEMENT; COMPLAINTS:
A.   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person
aggrieved") may file a complaint with the City Manager. Complaints shall be in
writing and shall contain the information and be in the form as the City
Manager requires. Upon receipt of a complaint, the City Manager shall furnish a
copy of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or are about
to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within thirty (30) days
after receiving a complaint, or within thirty (30) days after the expiration of
any period of reference under subsection C of this section, the City Manager
shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person
aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If the City Manager decides to
resolve the complaint, he shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the
alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference,
conciliation and persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of informal
endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding
under this chapter without the written consent of the persons concerned. Any
employee of the City Manager who shall make public any information in violation
of this subsection shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be punishable as provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code.
B.   A complaint under subsection A of this section shall be filed within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice
occurred. Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts upon which
the allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may
be reasonably and fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer
to the complaint against him and with the leave of the City Manager, which
shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, and may
amend his answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
C.   If, within thirty (30) days after a complaint is filed with the City
Manager, the City Manager has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with
this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter,
file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The City Manager will assist in this filing.
D.   If the City Manager has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance within
thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30)
days thereafter, commence a civil action in any appropriate court against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint.
If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in the
practice or order an affirmative action as may be appropriate.
E.   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of proof
shall be on the complainant.
F.   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the City
Manager shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain voluntary compliance.
(2002 Code § 93.32; amd. 2018 Code)

A.   In conducting an investigation, the City Manager shall have access at
reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy
materials and take and record the testimony or statements of the persons as are
reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation; provided,
however, that the City Manager first complies with the provisions of the Fourth
Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The City Manager may
issue subpoenas to compel this access to or the production of materials, or the
appearance of the persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to
the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the
subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in
the United States District Court for the district in which the investigation is
taking place. The City Manager may administer oaths.
B.   Upon written application to the City Manager, a respondent shall be
entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name
of the City Manager to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as
subpoenas issued by the City Manager himself. Subpoenas issued at the request
of a respondent shall show on their face the name and address of the respondent
and shall state that they were issued at his request.
C.   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the City Manager shall be entitled to
the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United
States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued
at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him.
D.   Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the
person may petition the City Manager to revoke or modify the subpoena. The City
Manager shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires
appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires
production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation,
that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be
produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
E.   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the City Manager or
other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in
the Municipal or State courts for the district in which the person to whom the
subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.
F.   Any person who wilfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence,
if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the
City Manager shall be punishable as provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the City
Manager, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in
any report, account, record or other document submitted to the City Manager
pursuant to this subpoena or other order, or shall wilfully neglect or fail to
make or cause to be made full, true and correct entries in reports, accounts,
records or other documents, or shall wilfully mutilate, alter or by any other
means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be punishable as provided in
section
1-4-1 of this Code.
G.   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the City Manager
participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this chapter. (2002 Code §
93.33; amd. 2018 Code)
6-6-11: ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS:
A.   The rights granted by sections
6-6-3,
 6-6-4 and
6-6-5 of this chapter may be enforced by civil actions in State or local courts
of general jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred;
provided, however, that the court shall continue civil case brought pursuant to
this section or subsection 6-6-9D of this chapter from time to time before
bringing it to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the
City Manager are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the
discriminatory housing practice complained of in the complaint made to the City
Manager and which practice forms the basis for the action in court; and
provided, however, that any sale, encumbrance or rental consummated prior to
the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this chapter, and
involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer or tenant without actual notice
of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the
provisions of this chapter shall not be affected. (2002 Code § 93.34; amd. 2018
Code)
B.   The court may grant as relief, is it deems appropriate, any permanent or
temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney
fees, in the case of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the plaintiff, in
the opinion of the court, is not financially able to assume the attorney fees.

person in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of his having exercised
or enjoyed, or on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in
the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by sections
 6-6-3,
 6-6-4 and
6-6-5 of this chapter. This subsection may be enforced by appropriate civil
action. (2002 Code § 93.35)
B.   Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, by force or threat of
force, wilfully injures, intimidates or interferes with, or attempts to injure,
intimidate or interfere with, any of the following shall be punishable by fines
and costs as provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code: (2002 Code § 93.36)
   1.   Any person because of his race, color, religion, national origin,
gender, age, disability or familial status and because he is or has been

for the sale, purchase, rental, financing or occupation of any dwelling, or
applying for or participating in any service, organization or facility relating
to the business of selling or renting dwellings; or

in actual pursuit of a person who is eluding or attempting to elude the officer
in violation of 21 Oklahoma Statutes section 540A.
   4.   The provisions of this section shall not relieve the driver of an
authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the
safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect the driver from the

8-4-1: AUTHORITY; FINDINGS; TITLE:
A.   Statute Authority: This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority
conferred by the Airport Zoning Act, 3 Oklahoma Statutes section 101 et seq.,
or the "Act". It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and
property of users of Scott Field and property or occupants of land in its
vicinity and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of
the area available for the landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft,
thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of Scott Field and the public
investment therein. Accordingly, it is hereby declared:
   1.   That the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the community served by Scott Field;
   2.   That it is therefore necessary in the interest of the public health,
public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport
hazards be prevented; and
   3.   That the prevention of these airport hazards or obstructions should be
accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police
power without compensation.
B.   Authority To Expend Funds: It is further declared that both the prevention
of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination,
removal, alteration, mitigation or the marking and lighting of existing airport
hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and
expend public funds and acquire land or property interests therein.
C.   Title: This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the SCOTT FIELD
ZONING ORDINANCE. (2002 Code § 155.01)
8-4-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   AIRPORT: Scott Field, the public, City owned airport at Mangum.
   AIRPORT ELEVATION: The highest point of an airport's usable landing area
measured in feet from sea level. Scott Field has an elevation of one thousand
six hundred forty four feet (1,644') above mean sea level (MSL), based on
ultimate development as depicted on the airport layout drawing dated March 12,
1998.
   AIRPORT HAZARD: Any structure or tree or use of land which obstructs the
airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at Scott

   AIRPORT HAZARD AREA: Any area of land or water upon which an airport hazard
might be established if not prevented as provided in this chapter.
   APPROACH SURFACE: A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway
centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the primary surface
and at the same slope as the Approach Zone height limitation slope set forth in
section
8-4-4 of this chapter. In plan, the perimeter of the approach surface coincides
with the perimeter of the Approach Zone.
   APPROACH, TRANSITIONAL, HORIZONTAL, AND CONICAL ZONES: These zones are set
forth in section
8-4-3 of this chapter.
   BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT: A board consisting of five (5) members appointed by the
City as provided in section
2-1-1 of this Code.
   CONICAL SURFACE: A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery
of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal
distance of four thousand feet (4,000').
   HAZARD TO AIR NAVIGATION: An obstruction determined to have a substantial
adverse effect on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace.
   HEIGHT: For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set
forth in this chapter and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea
level elevation unless otherwise specified.

the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which, in plan, coincides
with the perimeter of the Horizontal Zone.
   NONCONFORMING USE: Any preexisting structure, object of natural growth or
use of land that is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or an
amendment hereto.
   NONPRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY: A runway having an existing instrument
approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only horizontal
guidance or area type navigation equipment for which a straight-in nonprecision
instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned.

   TRANSITIONAL SURFACES: These surfaces extend outward at ninety degree (90°)
angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope
of seven feet (7') horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the
primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and
conical surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the nonprecision
approach surfaces, which project through and beyond the limits of the conical
surface, extend a distance of five thousand feet (5,000'), measured
horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at ninety degree (90°)
angles to the extended runway centerline.

of Commissioners. (2002 Code § 155.02; amd. 2018 Code)
8-4-3: AIRPORT ZONES:
In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created
and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the
approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical
surfaces as they apply to Scott Field. The zones are shown on the Scott Field
Zoning Map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Leard Bice Reeder, Inc., and
dated July 1998, which is adopted by reference and hereby expressly
incorporated and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one of the
following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive
height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as
follows: (2002 Code § 155.04)
A.   Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum Greater Than 1-Mile
Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: The inner edge of this Approach Zone
coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred feet (500')
wide. The Approach Zone expands outward uniformly to a width of three thousand
five hundred feet (3,500') at a horizontal distance of ten thousand feet
(10,000') from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the
centerline of the runway. (2002 Code § 155.04; amd. 2018 Code)
B.   Transitional Zones: The Transitional Zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
C.   Horizontal Zone: The Horizontal Zone is established by swinging arcs of
five thousand feet (5,000') radii for all runways, designated utility or
visual, and ten thousand feet (10,000') for all others from the center of each
end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by
drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The Horizontal Zone does not include the
Approach and Transitional Zones.
D.   Conical Zone: The Conical Zone is established as the area that commences
at the periphery of the Horizontal Zone and extends outward therefrom a
horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000'). (2002 Code § 155.04)
8-4-4: AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow, in any zone
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for the zone. Applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the zones in question as follows: (2002 Code § 155.05)
A.   Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum Greater Than 1-Mile
Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: Slopes thirty four feet (34') outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand feet
(10,000') along the extended runway centerline. (2002 Code § 155.05; amd. 2018
Code)
B.   Transitional Zones: Slope seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation which is one thousand six hundred forty four
feet (1,644') above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are
established height limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface,
and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision
instrument runway Approach Zone projects beyond the Conical Zone, there are
established height limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface, and
extending a horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000'), measured at
ninety degree (90°) angles to the extended runway centerline.
C.   Horizontal Zone: Established at one hundred fifty feet (150') above the
airport elevation or at a height of one thousand seven hundred ninety four feet
(1,794') above mean sea level.
D.   Conical Zone: Slopes twenty feet (20') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the Horizontal Zone and at one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred
fifty feet (350') above the airport elevation.
E.   Excepted Height Limitations: Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as
prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or growth of any
tree, to a height up to fifty feet (50') above the surface of the land. (2002
Code § 155.05)
8-4-5: USE RESTRICTION:
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land or water within any zone established by this chapter in a manner as to
create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication
between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish
between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using
the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird
strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing,
takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. (2002 Code §
155.06)
8-4-6: NONCONFORMING USES:
A.   Regulations Not Retroactive:
   1.   The regulations prescribed in this chapter shall not be construed to
require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or
tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date hereof, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use.

alteration or intended use of any structure if the construction or alteration
of which was begun prior to the effective date hereof and is diligently
prosecuted.
B.   Marking And Lighting: Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the
owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to
permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of markers and
lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator to indicate to
the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of an
airport obstruction. Markers and lights shall be installed, operated and
maintained at the expense of the City. (2002 Code § 155.07)
8-4-7: PERMIT REQUIREMENTS; EXCEPTIONS:
A.   Future Uses:
   1.   Except as specifically provided in subsections A1a, A1b and A1c of this
section, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure
shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any
zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and
granted upon the prior payment of the appropriate permit fee to be established
from time to time. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If the determination is in the affirmative, the
permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions
of this chapter shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in
accordance with subsection D of this section.
      a.   In the area lying within the limits of the Horizontal Zone and
Conical Zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, the tree or structure
would extend above the height limits prescribed for the zones.
      b.   In areas lying within the limits of the Approach Zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet (4,200')
from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the
ground, except when the tree or structure would extend above the height limit
prescribed for the Approach Zones.
      c.   In the areas lying within the limits of the Transition Zones beyond
the perimeter of the Horizontal Zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the
ground, except when the tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or
topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the
Transition Zones.
   2.   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed
as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration of any
structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter, except as set forth in section
8-4-4 of this chapter.
B.   Existing Uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date hereof, or any amendments hereto, or than it is when the
application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for a
permit shall be granted.
C.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned, more than eighty percent (80%) torn down or physically deteriorated
or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or tree
to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations.
D.   Variances:
   1.   Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure,
or permit the growth of any tree, or use of property, not in accordance with
the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from the regulations.
   2.   The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination
from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on
the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable airspace.
   3.   Variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal
application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary
hardship, and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will
not be an airport hazard or create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter.
   4.   Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this
chapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the Zoning Administrator for advice as to the
aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Zoning Administrator does not
respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the Board of
Adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny the application.
E.   Obstruction Marking And Lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if
an action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be
reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of
the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the
owner's expense, markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by
the Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to
permit the City, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the
necessary markings and lights. (2002 Code § 155.08)
8-4-8: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
A.   It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to administer and enforce
the regulations prescribed herein.
B.   Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the Zoning
Administrator upon a form created for that purpose.

which the Board of Adjustment, under the regulations, may be required to pass
under this chapter;
   3.   To authorize in specific cases the variances from the terms of this
chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result
in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed and substantial justice done; and
   4.   Exceptions and/or variances may only be allowed by the Board of
Adjustment only after notice and hearing as provided in 11 Oklahoma Statutes
section 44-108.
B.   Written Findings: The Board of Adjustment shall make written findings of
facts and conclusions of law giving the facts upon which it acted and its legal
conclusions from the facts in reversing, affirming or modifying any order,
requirement, decision or determination which properly comes before it under the
provisions of this chapter.
C.   Voting Of Members: The concurring vote of three (3) members of the Board
of Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or

lessee or otherwise, allow connection or attachment of any kind of pipe, wire,
magnet, or other contrivance to any pipe, wire, line or other conductor
carrying electricity and belonging to the Mangum Utilities Authority in such a
manner as to enable him to consume or use the electricity without its passing
through the meter or any other way so as to evade payment therefor. (2002 Code
§ 51.12)

control of any property within the City, whether as owner, tenant, occupant,
lessee or otherwise, allow a jumping device, an unauthorized meter or a broken
meter seal to be discovered on the property or premises, and the person in
charge or control of the property, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee
or otherwise, shall be penalized the sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00)
before service will be restored at the sole discretion of the City Manager.
   2.   In case of a broken electric seal, the penalty will not be imposed
until the second broken seal is discovered if the person in charge or control
of the property within the City, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or
otherwise, notifies the City of a broken seal condition.
   3.   Repeated reports of broken seals at the same property or premises may
result in the City Manager determining the same has in fact been tampered with,
and electrical service will be terminated automatically. A penalty of two
hundred dollars ($200.00) will be imposed against the person in charge or
control of the property, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or
otherwise, before services will be restored, at the sole discretion of the City
Manager.
   4.   In the event of a second broken seal or incident as hereinabove
described, the City Manager may refuse service or impose a two hundred dollar
($200.00) penalty. In cases of service refusal or the imposition of a penalty
of two hundred dollars ($200.00), the person or persons wishing to have service
restored or avoid penalty will be required to have their request placed on the
agenda and personally appear before the Board of Commissioners at the next
scheduled meeting in order to voice their complaint, and the decision of the
Commissioners shall be final. (2002 Code § 51.12)

10-3-3: BOARDING AND SECURING DILAPIDATED BUILDINGS; CLEANING PREMISES:
A.   After a building has been declared dilapidated, as provided in section
10-3-2 of this chapter, and before the commencement of the tearing and removal
of a dilapidated building, the Board of Commissioners may authorize that a
building be boarded and secured.
B.   However, the Board of Commissioners may cause the premises on which an
unsecured building is located to be cleaned of trash and weeds in accordance
with the provisions of sections
5-1-1,
5-1-2 and
5-1A-6 of this Code.
C.   The Board of Commissioners may cause an unsecured building to be boarded
and secured in accordance with the following procedures:
   1.   Notices: Before the Board of Commissioners orders an action, at least a
ten (10) day notice that the unsecured building is to be boarded and secured
shall be given by mail to any property owners and mortgage holders, as provided
in section
10-3-2 of this chapter. At the time of mailing of notice to any property owner
or mortgage holder, the City shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal
service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and
address of the mailee. A copy of the notice shall also be posted on the
property to be affected. However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage
holder can be located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on
the property or by publication, as defined in 11 Oklahoma Statutes section 1-
102. Notice shall be published one time, not less than ten (10) days prior to
any hearing or action by the City pursuant to the provisions of this section.
If the Board of Commissioners anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in
accordance with the provisions of subsection C9 of this section, the notice
shall state that any subsequent need for boarding and securing the building
within a six (6) month period after the initial boarding and securing of the
building pursuant to notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the Board
of Commissioners. The costs of boarding and securing shall be assessed against
the owner. A lien may be imposed on the property to secure payment, without
further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage holder. (2002 Code §
150.37)
   2.   Consent Of Owner For City To Board And Secure: The owner of the
property may give his written consent to the City authorizing the boarding and
securing of the unsecured building and to the payment of any costs incurred
thereby. By giving the written consent, the owner waives any right the owner
has to a hearing by the Board of Commissioners. (2002 Code § 150.37; amd. 2018
Code)
   3.   Hearing: If the property owner does not give his written consent to the
actions, a hearing may be held by the Board of Commissioners to determine
whether the boarding and securing of the unsecured building would promote and
benefit the public health, safety or welfare. The hearing may be held in
conjunction with a hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds
or grass on the premises of the unsecured building held pursuant to the
provisions of subsection
5-1A-6C of this Code.
   4.   Decision And Action: In making the determination, the Board of
Commissioners shall apply the following standard: The Board of Commissioners
may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured building when the boarding
and securing thereof would make the building less available for transient
occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by the building or decrease the
hazard that the building would constitute an attractive nuisance to children.
Upon making the required determination, the Board of Commissioners may order
the boarding and securing of the unsecured building.
   5.   Notice Of Lien: After the Board of Commissioners orders the boarding
and securing of the unsecured building, the City Clerk shall immediately file a
notice of unsecured building and lien with the County Clerk describing the
property, stating the findings of the City at the hearing at which the building
was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the City claims a lien on the
property for the costs of boarding and securing the building and that the costs
are the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date of
filing the notice.
   6.   Entry Powers To Board And Secure: Pursuant to the order of the Board of
Commissioners, the agents of the City are granted the right of entry on the
property for the performance of the boarding and securing of the building and
for the performance of all necessary duties as a governmental function of the
City. (2002 Code § 150.37)
   7.   Costs:
      a.   After an unsecured building has been boarded and secured, the Board
of Commissioners shall determine the actual costs of the actions and any other
expenses that may be necessary in conjunction therewith including the cost of
the notice and mailing. The City Clerk shall forward a statement of the actual
costs attributable to the boarding and securing of the unsecured building and a
demand for payment of costs, by mail, to any property owners and mortgage
holders as provided in section
10-3-2 of this chapter. At the time of mailing of the statement of costs to any
property owner or mortgage holder, the City shall obtain a receipt of mailing
from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and
the name and address of the mailee. (2002 Code § 150.37; amd. 2018 Code)
      b.   If the City boards and secures any unsecured building, the cost to
the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, materials and
equipment required for the performance of the actions. If the actions are done
on a private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and
best bidder. (2002 Code § 150.37)
   8.   Payment Or Failure To Pay Costs: When payment is made to the City for
costs incurred, the City Clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment
attributable to the actual costs of the boarding and securing of the unsecured
building is not made within thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of
the statement to the owner of the property, the City Clerk shall forward a
certified statement of the amount of the costs to the County Treasurer. Once
certified to the County Treasurer, payment may only be made to the County
Treasurer except as otherwise provided in this section. At the time of
collection, the County Treasurer shall collect a fee of five dollars ($5.00)
for each parcel of property, and such fee shall be deposited to the General
Fund of the County. The costs shall be levied on the property and collected by
the County Treasurer as are other taxes authorized by law. Until fully paid,
the costs and the interest thereon shall be the personal obligation of the
property owner from and after the date the notice of unsecured building and
lien is filed with the County Clerk. In addition, the costs and the interest
thereon shall be a lien against the property from the date the notice of the
lien is filed with the County Clerk. The lien shall be coequal with the lien of
ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior
and superior to all other titles and liens against the property. The lien shall
continue until the costs and interest are fully paid. At any time prior to
collection as provided in this subsection, the City may pursue any civil remedy
for collection of the amount owing and interest thereon including an action in
personam against the property owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien
against the property. A mineral interest, if severed from the surface owner,
shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this
section. Upon receiving payment, the City Clerk shall forward to the County
Treasurer a notice of payment and shall direct discharge of the lien. (2002
Code § 150.37; amd. 2018 Code)
   9.   Subsequent Offenses: If the Board of Commissioners causes a structure
within the City limits to be boarded and secured, any subsequent need for
boarding and securing within a six (6) month period constitutes a public
nuisance and may be summarily boarded and secured without further prior notice
to the property owner or mortgage holder. At the time of each summary boarding
and securing, the City shall notify the property owner and mortgage holder of
the boarding and the costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property
owner may request an appeal with the City Clerk within ten (10) days after the
mailing of the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as provided in
subsection C1 of this section. Unless otherwise determined at the hearing, the
cost of boarding and securing shall be determined and collected as provided in
subsections C7 and C8 of this section.
   10.   Summary Boarding And Securing: The Board of Commissioners may
determine that a building is unsecured and order that the building be boarded
and secured in the manner provided in this subsection even though the building
has not been declared by the Board of Commissioners to be dilapidated. (2002
Code § 150.37)
   11.   Enforcement And Appeals: The City Manager shall carry out the duties
of the Board of Commissioners specified in this section. The property owner or
mortgage holder shall have a right of appeal to the Board of Commissioners for

DOWNTOWN MANGUM
SECTION:
10-4-1: Purpose
10-4-2: Permit Required For Construction, Alteration Or Removal
10-4-3: Design Review Process
10-4-1: PURPOSE:
A.   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the protection, preservation
and enhancement of downtown Mangum, more specifically designated and being
described as the "Designated Main Street Area" (DMSA). The DMSA shall be as
shown on the map on file in the Office of the City Clerk. (2002 Code § 150.50;
amd. 2018 Code)
B.   The City hereby establishes procedures, regulations and conditions for the
preservation, protection, restoration and perpetuation of certain improvements,
building exteriors, structures and signs within those above described platted
blocks designated herein as downtown Mangum for the following reasons:
   1.   To preserve, protect, enhance and perpetuate certain improvements and
buildings which reflect the historical heritage of Mangum by controlling
indiscriminate erections of new improvements, structures and buildings and by
fostering proper maintenance and repair of existing improvements, structures
and buildings;
   2.   To promote the continuing use of existing structures within the City
and justify the demolition thereof; and
   3.   To foster and encourage harmonious architectural styles within the
Downtown District. (2002 Code § 150.50)
10-4-2: PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CONSTRUCTION, ALTERATION OR REMOVAL:
It shall be unlawful and an offense for any person to tear down, demolish,
construct, alter or remove any building, improvement or portion thereof which
is within the described Downtown District, or to alter in any manner an
exterior architectural feature of such a building without first obtaining a
permit to do so in the manner provided by this chapter. (2002 Code § 150.51)
10-4-3: DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS:
A.   Certification Of Approval Required: A Certificate of Approval from the
Planning Commission should be obtained prior to obtaining a building permit
for:
   1.   The construction of any new building, whether preengineered or site
built; and
   2.   The total or partial demolition of any (main) structure.
B.   Basis For Decision; Appeals: The Planning Commission, when considering
applications for a Certificate of Approval, shall base its decision upon the
design guidelines as contained in this section. An applicant may appeal the
decision of the Planning Commission. Any appeal shall be made in writing to the
City within twenty (20) days following the decision by the Planning Commission.
Final appeals may be made to the Mayor and Board of Commissioners. (2002 Code §
150.52; amd. 2018 Code)
C.   Design Guidelines: The following design guidelines are advisory and
intended to serve as a reference for any person or entity contemplating the
construction, renovation, remodel, or restoration of any building located
within the DMSA. The Mangum Main Street Design Committee may provide technical
assistance for any such work.
   1.   Setbacks for new buildings and additions to buildings should be in
keeping with other buildings on the block; normally, new buildings should be
located in the front and side property lines, and the setback area should be
designed and landscaped so as to complement the existing facilities within the
core area. The historic character and texture of the area is best served
through the observance of platted building property lines.
   2.   Original building facades are an established and critical
characteristic of the DMSA. New and renovated facades should enhance or
complement this characteristic. The design and construction of new buildings
should incorporate facade elements that are consistent with and otherwise
enhance these same characteristics.
   3.   Buildings should have the appearance of a flat roof from the ground,
and parapets should hide pitched roofs. Roofs with other appearance should be
closely reviewed for the district's architectural improvement and for design
impact on the district and adjacent structures.
   4.   Window alignment and type should be compatible with adjacent buildings.
During and after restoration and renovation of window openings, the windows
should be set two inches (2") to three inches (3") from the facade front.
   5.   Original window, door, and freight bay door openings should be
reestablished during renovations, on a story level by story level basis for
those stories included within a building permit application, if these openings
have been blocked in with wood, brick or other materials. Doors, windows and
freight bay doors should not typically be blocked in with brick and panels. For
example, one of the compatible styles of closure for freight bay doors would
resemble a tongue and groove wooden warehouse door.
   6.   Existing brick surfaces should not be covered with paint, wood,
plastic, metal, or other materials. This shall not apply to historic signage,
as these may be restored with paint. The preferred method of signage of
buildings is the attached sign mounted on the building.
   7.   The removal of paint from a facade should utilize a method which is
known not to damage the brick, brick glazing, or stucco. Sandblasting would not
generally be considered an appropriate method of paint removal for brick
surfaces.
   8.   Facades should be designed or renovated with a design that is
compatible with the older and historic buildings common to the area. Facade
designs to be discouraged include those characterized by mirrored glass; panel
walls made of glass, plastic or metal; smooth steel or smooth composite walls;
or prefabricated tilt up concrete walls. Historic building ornamentation should
not be removed or covered.
   9.   A building recognized locally or nationally for its architectural or
historical significance should not be demolished unless there is no reasonable
economic alternative.
   10.   Rooftop accessory and rooftop nonaccessory signs may be appropriate if
designed as a landmark that conveys a message or logo enhancing the identity of
the district.
   11.   Nonaccessory signs serving as local directional signs for patrons of
the DMSA may be utilized on a limited basis, such as two (2) per geographic
block. The display surface should not exceed twelve (12) square feet per sign.
Styles of lettering commonly used around the 1920s are recommended. Wall and
ground signs constructed of wood and/or metal are preferred.
   12.   Sightproof screening may include natural or manmade materials, and the
design should yield a screen that is durable. When the material used is not
vegetation, brick or stone, the surface should be painted or otherwise coated
in a uniform color.
   13.   Street frontages of parking lots are highly visible, and the lot
boundaries can be designed to create security, a pleasant environment, and an
obscured view of both debris and parked vehicles. The addition of landscaping
can provide beneficial microclimatic effects. (2002 Code § 150.52)

13-1-14: Violations; Penalties
13-1-1: STATUTE AUTHORITY:
The legislature of the State has in 82 Oklahoma Statutes sections 1601 through
1620.1, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. (2002 Code § 151.01; amd.
2018 Code)
13-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and the
occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to
other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise
protected from flood damage. (2002 Code § 151.02)
13-1-3: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A.   Protect human life and health;
B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (2002 Code § 151.03)
13-1-4: METHODS OF ACCOMPLISHING PURPOSE:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property
in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural
protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (2002 Code § 151.05)

anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a
flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones AE, A, and X,
"elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid
foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site

      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within the City subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height. A floodway is located within areas of special flood hazard established
in section
13-1-8 of this chapter. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use that cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair

is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that the enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable
nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of title 44 CFR (the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations).
   MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction"
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
      A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
      B.   Any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the City Board of Commissioners to a person
from the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full
requirements, see section 60.6 of title 44 CFR.)
   VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified) of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas. (2002

provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in
favor of the Board of Commissioners and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any
other powers granted under State Statutes. (2002 Code § 151.10; amd. 2018 Code)
C.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and any other ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflicts or overlaps, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail. (2002 Code § 151.09)
D.   Compliance Required: No structure or land shall hereafter be located,
altered or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this
chapter and other applicable regulations. (2002 Code § 151.08)
13-1-7: FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
A.   County Emergency Manager Serve As: The City Board of Commissioners
designates the Greer County Emergency Manager as the Floodplain Administrator

surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'); provided, that
the applicant for the development permit in that case first complies with 44
CFR section 65.12. (2002 Code § 151.43)
13-1-10: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards, the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
   1.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   2.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   3.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with material resistant to flood damage;

and constructed with flood resistant materials;
      g.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement;
      h.   Floodway requirements must be met in the construction of the
structure;
      i.   Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be
provided below the BFE; and
      j.   The structure shall be located so as not to cause damage to adjacent
and nearby structures. (2002 Code § 151.26)
C.   Standards For Subdivisions:
   1.   The applicant for a development permit for any subdivision located in
Zones A and AE, which is fifty one (51) or more lots or greater than five (5)
acres, shall generate the base flood elevation data for that subdivision.
   2.   All subdivisions, including the placement of manufactured home parks
and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
   3.   All subdivisions, including the placement of manufactured home parks
and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage. (2002 Code § 151.27)
D.   Floodways: The following provisions shall apply to floodways:
   1.   Encroachments including, but not limited to fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development, are prohibited within the
adopted floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the City during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   2.   If subsection D1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
   3.   The City may permit encroachments within the adopted floodway that
would result in an increase in base flood elevations; provided, that the
applicant for the development permit complies with all of 44 CFR section 65.12.
(2002 Code § 151.28)
13-1-11: VARIANCES:
A.   General Provisions:
   1.   The City Board of Commissioners may grant variances for uses which do
not satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or this
chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that: a)
compliance with this chapter will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable
taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people; and
b) satisfies the pertinent provisions of this section. However, no variance
shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit the
continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
   2.   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any person
who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the State.
   3.   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than twenty
(20) years.
   4.   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the City Board
of Commissioners, accompanied by a filing fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00).
   5.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, provided the relevant factors in subsection
13-1-9C of this chapter and provisions of this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. (2002 Code
§ 151.44)
   6.   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base flood
elevation will be issued a notice signed by the Mayor which states that: a) the
cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting
from permitting the structure to be built lower than the base flood elevation;
and b) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property. (2002 Code § 151.44; amd. 2018 Code)
   7.   At such time as the City Board of Commissioners deems the petition
ready for notification to the public, the Board shall schedule a hearing and
direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in Greer County at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing.
   8.   The City Board of Commissioners shall conduct the hearing and make
determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section.
The City Board of Commissioners shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the
equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to
the public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted.
   9.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and
      d.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   10.   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the
intent of this chapter, the City Board of Commissioners may attach such
conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the
purposes and objectives stated in section
13-1-3 of this chapter. (2002 Code § 151.44)
   11.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any variance
issued by the Board of Commissioners shall be sent by the Floodplain
Administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within fifteen (15) days after issuance of
the variance. (2002 Code § 151.44; amd. 2018 Code)

13-1-13: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within the areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City or any official or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (2002 Code § 151.11)
13-1-14: VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate or other certifications required in this chapter is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of
its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be punishable as provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code for each violation and, in addition shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City
Board of Commissioners or the City Attorney from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (2002 Code § 151.99;
amd. 2018 Code)
